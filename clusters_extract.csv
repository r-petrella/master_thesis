Such therapies became popular at the end of the twentieth century. This therapeutic approach may include therapeutic horticulture, nature therapies, care farming, facilitated exercise, and animal-assisted therapies with farm animals (AATF). This paper describes the processes of planning and creating an AATF-based clinical intervention wherein persons with TBI interacted with ducks (in twice weekly, 1-hour groups) for 12 wk at a TBI rehabilitation facility. The discussion includes site identification, stakeholder engagement, intervention design and human and animal safety procedures. The research methods, theoretical framework, ethical consideration, and risk reduction strategies for human participants and ducks are discussed. Also, description of challenges and blueprints of possible solutions for other researchers interested in developing similar initiatives. This program will serve as a study site for examining effects of AATF-based interventions on self-efficacy, depression, and anxiety in persons with TBI. If the study suggests that AATF interventions with ducks may lead to positive changes, the proposed study will be followed with studies that include larger samples at multiple sites. Findings in this paper may contribute to the implementation science body of knowledge. Because of that, the information in this paper may benefit the researchers outside of the healthcare arena. From that perspective methods described in this paper may help to develop studies that focus on policy development, program expansion, or individual project implementation. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Animals; Anxiety Disorders; Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Ducks; Humans; Repressor Proteins; Self Efficacy; AATF protein, human; apoptosis regulatory protein; repressor protein; animal; anxiety disorder; duck; human; self concept; traumatic brain injury","""Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion: Studies on Impacts, Recovery, and Influences""",Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion Studies in Young Athletes,Impact of Physical Exercise on Mental Health Disorders

In adolescents, falls and sports related trauma are often the causes of mTBI. Importantly, critical brain growth and development occurs during this sensitive period making the prospect of a brain injury a worrying phenomenon. Upwards of 70% of patients report circadian disruption following these injuries and this has been shown to impede recovery. Therefore, we sought to determine if core circadian clock gene expression was disrupted in rat model of repetitive mTBI (RmTBI). Male and female adolescent rats (n = 129) received sham or RmTBI. The animals were then euthanized at different times throughout the day and night. Tissue from the hypothalamus, cerebellum, hippocampus, liver, and small intestine were evaluated for the expression of per1, per2, cry1, clock, bmal1 and rev-erb-α. We found most clock genes varied across the day/night indicating circadian expression patterns. In the hypothalamus we found RmTBI altered the expression of cry1 and bmal1 in addition to sex differences in per2, cry1, clock, bmal1 and rev-erb- α. In the cerebellum, per1, per2, cry1, clock, bmal1 and rev-erb-α rhythms were all knocked out by RmTBI in addition to sex differences in cry1, clock and bmal1 expression. We also detected a significant decrease in overall expression of all clock genes in males in the middle of the night. In the hippocampus we found that RmTBI changed the rhythm of rev-erb-α expression in addition to sex differences in bmal1 expression. In the liver we detected strong rhythms in all genes examined, however only per2 expression was knocked out by RmTBI, in addition we also detected sex differences in per2 and cry1. We also detected an overall decrease in female clock gene expression in the early night. In the small intestine, RmTBI altered cry1 expression and there were sex differences in rev-erb-α. These results indicate that RmTBI alters core circadian clock gene expression in the central and peripheral nervous system in a time, tissue and sex dependent manner. This may be disrupting important phase relationships between the brain and peripheral nervous system and contributing to post-injury symptomology and also highlights the importance for time and sex dependent assessment of injury outcomes. © 2023",Circadian; Concussion; Insomnia; Intestine; Liver; Sex differences; Sleep,complementary DNA; cryptochrome 1; cyclophilin A; nuclear receptor NR1D1; PER1 protein; PER2 protein; transcription factor ARNTL; transcription factor CLOCK; tryptophan hydroxylase; tyrosine 3 monooxygenase; adolescent; anesthesia induction; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cerebellar tissue; circadian rhythm; controlled study; female; gene expression; hippocampal tissue; hypothalamic tissue; liver tissue; male; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; rat; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; small intestine tissue; Sprague Dawley rat; traumatic brain injury,"""Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion: Studies on Impacts, Recovery, and Influences""",Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion Studies in Young Athletes,Post-Concussion Symptoms and Recovery in Adolescents

However, there is a lack of data about the velocity of the core and upper limbs during the execution of this technique. The aim of this study was to evaluate the differences in velocities of all crucial body segments while executing roundhouse kicks for both sides of the body. Thirteen elite taekwon-do athletes participated in this study. They performed kicks to a table tennis ball three times using each leg. The spatial-temporal data of markers placed on toes, knees, hips, shoulders, elbows, hands, and sternum were captured with the use of the Human Motion Lab equipment composed of 10 infrared cameras NIR Vicon MX-T40. There were statistical differences in the maximal velocity of the sternum and opposite shoulder. There were different correlations between the time of acquiring maximal velocities of specific body segments and the maximal velocity of the toe marker for each kicking side. Higher correlations were observed for the left kick despite the participant’s declaration of their preference for the right leg. The obtained results facilitate the conclusion that small non-resistant targets require different motor control depending on the kicking side, despite not revealing significant differences between maximal velocity. While such an indicator could be perceived as a suitable benchmark of an athlete’s performance, more detailed analysis seems to be required for a better understanding of martial arts techniques. © 2023, Termedia Publishing House Ltd..

Objective: To compare the cardiorespiratory capacity of children and adolescents living in a moderate altitude region of Peru with international studies and to develop reference values for the 6-min walk test (6MWT) according to age and sex. Methodology: A descriptive cross-sectional study of schoolchildren from a region of moderate altitude in Peru was carried out. A total of 704 schoolchildren (400 males and 304 females) with an age range of 6 to 17 years were studied. Weight, standing height, waist circumference (WC), body mass index (BMI) and tri-ponderal mass index (TMI) were evaluated. The 6MWT was assessed in a straight line over a distance of 30 m. Percentiles were created through the LMS method [L (skewness: lambda), M (median: mu) and S (coefficient of variation: Mu)]. Results: There were discrepancies in cardiorespiratory fitness performance with international studies by age and sex. The schoolchildren in the study reached stability and the highest number of meters in the last two age ranges (14 to 15 years: 698.1 m and 16 to 17 years 686.3 m in males). While females (14 to 15 years: 698.1 m and 16 to 17 years: 686.3 m). The proposed percentile values show ascending values as age advances. The cut-off points adopted are: low cardiorespiratory fitness < p25, moderate p25 to p75 and high cardiorespiratory fitness p > 75. Conclusion: We verified that the cardiorespiratory fitness evaluated by means of the 6MWT is ascending with the course of age. Even the performance with other countries is heterogeneous at early and middle ages, stabilizing during adolescence. The proposed reference values can be used to evaluate and monitor cardiorespiratory fitness during physical education classes. © The Author(s) 2024.",Adolescents; Children; Moderate altitude); Reference values; Six-minute walk test,Adolescent; Altitude; Body Mass Index; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Peru; Reference Values; Walk Test; Walking; adolescent; altitude; anthropometry; Article; body height; body mass; body weight; cardiorespiratory fitness; child; controlled study; cross-sectional study; descriptive research; female; human; human experiment; male; normal human; Peru; physical activity; reference value; six minute walk test; triponderal mass index; waist circumference; reference value; walk test; walking,"""Physical Activity, Fitness, and Health Studies in Children and Adolescents""",Physical Activity and Its Effects on Health and Well-being in Children and Adolescents,Physical Fitness in Children and Adolescents

It is well established that individuals who experience greater acute symptoms following concussion are at risk for slower recovery and persistent symptoms. We examined whether youth with ADHD experience worse acute effects, within the first 72 h following concussion, compared to youth without ADHD. We hypothesized that youth with ADHD would perform worse on neurocognitive testing and endorse more severe symptoms acutely following injury, but the magnitude of change from pre injury to post injury would be similar for both groups, and thus comparable to baseline group differences. The sample included 852 adolescents with pre-injury and post-injury ImPACT results (within 72 h); we also conducted supplementary case-control analyses on a subset of youth with and without ADHD matched on demographics and pre-injury health history. For both samples, there were significant interaction effects for the Verbal Memory and Visual Motor Speed composites (p < 0.01, η2=.01–.07, small-medium effect), such that youth with ADHD showed a greater magnitude of diminished cognitive functioning from pre-injury to post-injury testing. There were no significant differences in the magnitudes of changes from pre injury to post injury with regard to overall symptom reporting (i.e., total symptom severity scores, total number of symptoms endorsed); however, there were group differences in endorsement rates for several individual symptoms. Further research is needed to determine whether such differential acute effects are associated with recovery time in youth with ADHD. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",ADHD; cognition; Mild traumatic brain injury; sports,Adolescent; Athletic Injuries; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Brain Concussion; Cognition; Humans; Neuropsychological Tests; adolescent; Article; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; cognition; concussion; controlled study; demographics; female; human; juvenile; major clinical study; male; sport; traumatic brain injury; velocity; verbal memory; brain concussion; complication; neuropsychological assessment; psychology; sport injury,"""Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion: Studies on Impacts, Recovery, and Influences""",Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion Studies in Young Athletes,Post-Concussion Symptoms and Recovery in Adolescents

It occurred with high incidence among general population and especially among individuals participating sports and outdoor activities. A certain proportion of individuals who once developed LAS may suffer persistent ankle pain that affects daily activities. However, the mechanisms underlying LAS-induced pain still remained largely unknown. Methods: We established a LAS mouse model and systematically evaluated the pain-related behaviors in this mouse model. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), combined with bioinformatics analysis, was undertaken to explore gene expression profiles. Immunostaining was used to study glial cell and neuron activation in ipsilateral spinal cord dorsal horn (SCDH) of LAS model mice. Ibuprofen was used to treat LAS model mice. Results: The LAS model mice developed obvious signs of mechanical and heat hypersensitivities as well as gait impairments in ipsilateral hind paws. Besides, LAS model mice developed signs of pain-related emotional disorder, including pain-induced aversion. By RNA-Seq, we were able to identify certain differentially expressed genes and signaling pathways that might contribute to pain mechanisms of LAS mouse model. In addition, LAS model mice showed increased c-Fos and p-ERK immunoreactivity as well as astrocyte and microglia overactivation in ipsilateral spinal cord dorsal horn, indicating central sensitization might occur. Finally, LAS model mice respond to ibuprofen, a drug clinically used to treat ankle sprain pain. Conclusion: Our study found LAS model mice may be used as a preclinical animal model for screening novel targets or therapies for ankle sprain. Thus, the study may further help to understand molecular mechanisms contributing to ankle sprain-induced pain.

However, the validity of this evaluation method of dynamic postural stability has not been clarified yet. This study aimed to verify the validity of the evaluation method for jump landing using the frame subtraction score based on the ground reaction force (GRF). Methods: Twenty subjects performed single-leg jump landing, and their dynamic postural stability index (DPSI), medial‒lateral stability index (MLSI), anterior‒posterior stability index, and vertical stability index (VSI) were calculated from the GRF. Simultaneously, motion images were captured using digital video cameras in the sagittal and frontal planes. After the motion images were analyzed using the frame subtraction method, the frame subtraction scores in the frontal, sagittal, and combined planes were calculated. To confirm its validity, the relationship between the frame subtraction scores and GRF parameters was investigated using Pearson's correlation analysis. Results: The frame subtraction scores in the frontal and combined planes were significantly correlated with the DPSI, MLSI, and VSI (r = 0.46–0.75, P < 0.05). Conclusions: Therefore, the frame subtraction method could be applied to the evaluation of dynamic postural stability.

Interventions aimed at reducing fall risk in older adults with a fear of falling typically aim to improve balance. However, this approach has limited success, and the idea that balance performance impacts fall risk in this population is largely based on research in the general older adult population. The aim of this study was to assess whether presence of fear of falling modifies the relationship between balance performance and future falls in a sample of nationally representative older adults. Methods: We analyzed data from 5151 community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries (65 years or older) from waves 1 and 2 of the National Health and Aging Trends Study. In this prospective cohort study, balance performance and fear of falling were recorded during wave 1, while a report of a fall was recorded during wave 2 (1-year follow-up). The interplay between fear of falling, balance performance, and fall risk was analyzed using logistic regression with fear of falling as a moderating variable while controlling for common confounding variables. Results: Twenty-seven percent of participants reported a fear of falling at wave 1 while 32.7% reported a fall at wave 2. Reduced balance performance was significantly associated with increased future fall likelihood in individuals with and without a fear of falling (P =.008). Further, the presence of fear of falling did not modify the association between balance and future falls (P =.749). Fear of falling was associated with increased future fall likelihood independent of balance performance (P <.001). Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that fear of falling did not modify the relationship between balance performance and future fall risk, thus suggesting that balance training is appropriate to reduce falls in older adults with a fear of falling. However, balance training alone may be insufficient to optimally reduce falls in older adults with a fear of falling, as the presence of this fear increased future fall risk independent of balance performance. © 2023 Authors.

Objectives: This literature review aimed to give a systematic overview of current applications, its mechanism of action, and its potential to provide tangible therapies in plastic surgery. Methods: The databases PubMed (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD), Embase (via Ovid [Elsevier, Amsterdam, the Netherlands]), and the Cochrane Library (Cochrane, London, UK) were searched for articles published up to June 1, 2021. Clinical studies of any design including ESWT in the context of plastic surgery were included. Two reviewers extracted data, and 46 articles were analyzed after application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: Forty-six included studies (n = 1496) were categorized into the following broad themes: cellulite/body contouring/skin rejuvenation, burns/scar treatment, diabetic foot ulcers/chronic wound, and future perspectives of ESWT. Overall, applications of ESWT were heterogenous, and the majority of studies reported effectiveness of ESWT as an alternative treatment technique. Flawed methodology and differences in technical standards limit the outcome and conclusion of this review. Conclusions: There is yet insufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of any specific intervention included in this review; however, all included studies reported improvements in key outcomes. Where reported, ESWT displayed a good safety profile with no serious adverse events. Further research is needed to provide more evidence to delineate the indications of ESWT in plastic surgery.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Cholesterol can accumulate in the tendon non-collagenous matrix which may affect both global and local tissue mechanics. Changes to the local strain environment within tendon may have significant implications for mechanosensitive tenocytes. Here, we investigated the association between elevated blood cholesterol and presence of tendon lipids in the Achilles tendon. We expected lipids to be localised in the proteoglycan-rich inter-sub-tendon matrix (ISTM), therefore we also sought to examine the impact of this on the biomechanical and viscoelastic properties of the ISTM. Methods: The Achilles tendons of 32 young wild-type (SD) and 32 apolipoprotein E knock-out rats (ApoE−/−) were harvested at 15.6 ± 2.3 weeks of age. 32 specimens underwent histological examination to assess the distribution of lipids throughout sub-tendons and ISTM. The remaining specimens were prepared for biomechanical testing, where the ISTM between the gastrocnemius and soleus sub-tendons was subjected to shear load mechanical testing. A sub-set of tests were video recorded to enable a strain analysis. Results: ApoE−/− serum cholesterol was double that of SD rats (mean 2.25 vs. 1.10 mg/ml, p < 0.001) indicating a relatively mild hypercholesterolemia phenotype. Nonetheless, we found histological evidence of esterified lipids in the ISTM and unesterified lipids in the sub-tendons, although the location or intensity of staining was not appreciably different between rat strains. Despite a lack of observable histological differences in lipid content between groups, there were significant differences in the mechanical and viscoelastic behaviour of the Achilles sub-tendon matrix. Conclusion: Even slightly elevated cholesterol may result in subtle changes to tendon biomechanical properties and hence injury risk. The young age of our cohort and the mild phenotype of our ApoE−/− rats are likely to have limited our findings and so we also conclude that the ApoE−/− rat model is not well suited for investigating the biomechanical impact of tendon xanthomas on Achilles sub-tendon function. © 2023, The Author(s).",Biomechanical properties; Force relaxation; Histology; Lipids; Xanthoma,"Achilles Tendon; Animals; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cholesterol; Hypercholesterolemia; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; apolipoprotein E; collagen type 1; fructose; lipid; oxidized low density lipoprotein; viscoelastic substance; cholesterol; achilles tendon; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; biomechanics; environmental enrichment; esterification; female; genotype; graft harvesting; histopathology; hypercholesterolemia; knockout rat; lipid diet; lipid storage; male; mechanical test; nonhuman; oxidative stress; phenotype; rat; soleus muscle; statistical analysis; tendon injury; viscoelasticity; wild type; achilles tendon; animal; hypercholesterolemia; injury; pathology; Sprague Dawley rat","""Achilles Tendinopathy and Musculoskeletal Ultrasound Studies in Sport Medicine""",Achilles Tendon Health & Rehabilitation Research,Advances in Tissue Regeneration and Healing in Musculoskeletal Disorders

A decreased capacity of the central nervous system to modulate pain has been suggested as a potential contributor to the persistence of pain. Objective: To investigate whether conditioned pain modulation (CPM), initial symptoms/disability, kinesiophobia, and pain catastrophizing is associated with the transition from acute to chronic LBP. Design: Prospective cohort study. Method: Fifty participants presenting with acute LBP (<6 weeks) took part in three evaluation sessions (baseline, 3 and 6 months). At baseline and 3-month evaluations, all participants completed self-administered questionnaires (Oswestry Disability Index [ODI], Short Form of Brief Pain Inventory [BPI-SF], Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia [TSK] and Pain Catastrophizing Scale [PCS]) and CPM was assessed. At the 6-month evaluation, questionnaires were readministered, and participants were dichotomized according to their status (Non-chronic LBP [NCLBP] or chronic LBP [CLBP]). Univariate tests were used to compare baseline variables between NCLBP and CLBP. Results: No significant baseline difference was found for TSK (p = 0.48), PCS (p = 0.78), CPM (p = 0.82), ODI (p = 0.78), BPI-SF severity (p = 0.50), and interference subscales (p = 0.54) between those categorized as NCLBP or CLBP at 6 months. Conclusions: This exploratory study failed to support the hypothesis that inefficient CPM mechanisms and the presence of psychological factors could be factors associated with the transition to chronic pain in individuals with acute LBP. © 2024 The Authors",Catastrophizing; Conditioned pain modulation; Kinesiophobia; Low back pain; Prognostic,Catastrophization; Humans; Kinesiophobia; Low Back Pain; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; adult; Article; Brief Pain Inventory; catastrophizing; chronicity; clinical article; cohort analysis; conditioned pain modulation; conditioning; controlled study; disability; disease severity; exploratory research; female; human; kinesiophobia; low back pain; male; Oswestry Disability Index; Pain Catastrophizing scale; population; prognosis; prospective study; symptom; Tampa scale for kinesiophobia; catastrophizing; prognosis; psychology,"""Pain Management and Musculoskeletal Health in Various Populations""",Chronic Pain Management and Treatment Studies,Management and Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

The sample consisted of N = 1198, 68.9% men, mean age 49.1 (SD = 11.4) using a cross-sectional design. We analysed several BREQ versions with confirmatory factor analysis to retain the one with the best model fit: The 15-item BREQ, 19-item BREQ-2, 19-item BREQ with integrated regulation, 18-item BREQ-3, and 24-item BREQ-3. An 18-item BREQ-2 with five factors (external, introjected, identified, and intrinsic regulation, and amotivation) showed excellent model fit (χ 2 = 493.848; df = 125; RMSEA =.050; 90% CI [0.045-0.054]; CFI =.975; TLI =.969; SRMR =.041), with the item “I get restless if I don’t exercise regularly” removed. Configural, metric, scalar, and strict measurement invariance was supported. Intrinsic motivation was associated with the PA index (PA-I), PA frequency, duration, and intensity, and estimated cardiorespiratory fitness (eCRF). Identified regulation was associated with PA-I, PA frequency and eCRF, and introjected regulation with PA-I and intensity. External regulation was negatively related to PA frequency and eCRF, while amotivation was unrelated to all outcomes. The results support the factorial validity of the 18-item BREQ-2. The poor model fit found for other BREQ versions warrants additional studies to investigate the psychometric properties in physically active adult samples. Autonomous motivation factors were most important for PA outcomes. © 2023 The Author(s).

The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a compression-only cardiopulmonary resuscitation and automated external defibrillator course among primary school students to increase their knowledge and technical skills and improve their attitudes. A quasi-experimental study was conducted using a pre–post non-equivalent design involving 38 students aged 10–12. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and automated external defibrillator (AED) knowledge, technical skills, and attitude towards CPR were assessed in a post test with three-month follow-up. Results of the MANOVA analysis showed significant differences in the level of knowledge (F = 10.29, p < 0.001) and attitude (F = 13.87, p < 0.001) based on the students’ age group at the time of the post test. The proportion of students who passed the technical skills component differed significantly by age (χ2 = 12.12; p = 0.002) and BMI (χ2 = 6.34; p = 0.041). No significant decay was reported in the total mean scores for knowledge, technical skills, and attitude (F = 0.727, p = 0.54) at 3-month follow-up. The course helped students perform CPR and utilize AED effectively while promoting a positive attitude with up to 3 months of retention, demonstrating the feasibility of extending the course within the Malaysian primary school curriculum. © 2022 by the authors.",automated external defibrillator; cardiopulmonary resuscitation; kids save lives; primary school student,Article; body mass; child; compression only cardiopulmonary resuscitation; controlled study; curriculum; effect size; female; follow up; health care personnel; health educationist; human; Malaysia; male; medical education; multivariate analysis of variance; paramedical personnel; physician; pilot study; primary school student; quasi experimental study; resuscitation; school child; scoring system; student; student attitude,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

This permits a wide array cut geometries that can be titrated to the individualized needs of each patient. Most common is the anteromedializing (AMZ) TTO, which has been a workhorse procedure for realigning extensor mechanism tracking. The patella can also be distalized, which becomes indicated when pathological patella alta is present. When treating patellar instability, a successful outcome depends on the clinician's understanding of the destabilizing factors. These risk factors are often additive, and if significant enough they can collectively breach a given stability threshold. Three-dimensional models provide a useful perspective of the joint morphology, curvature, and congruency which can be particularly helpful for developing an optimal plan for restoring balanced tracking. To decide when to perform a TTO, the decision centers on how well a TTO provides a solution to a tracking or articular loading problem, compared with the added morbidity that accompanies an osteotomy.

Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is an important indicator of cardiovascular health. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the CRF of NAFLD patients. Methods: Cross-sectional study, including 32 patients with biopsy-proved NAFLD. The patients underwent ergometric test (ET) and six-minute walk test (6MWT) to determine CRF. The test results were compared to disease parameters and with each other. Results: Considering the ET, 20 (62.5%) patients had very poor or poor CRF, and in 12 (37.5%), it was regular or good. In the 6MWT, 13 (40.6%) individuals had poor CRF, in 12 (37.5%), it was very poor, and in seven (21.9%), regular. NAFLD activity score (NAS) ≥5 was observed in 12 (37.5%) individuals. Twelve (37.5%) patients were sedentary, 11 (34.4%), insufficiently active, and nine (28.1%), active. Obesity and liver inflammation on biopsy were associated with very poor/poor CRF. NAS ≥5 and sedentary lifestyle were independently associated with very poor/poor CRF by ET. Although mean VO2max values determined by both tests were similar, no correlation of VO2max determined by ET and 6MWT was observed, as occurred for the distance walked in 6MWT and values of metabolic equivalent (MET) determined by ET. There was no reproducibility between CRF determined by ET and 6MWT. Conclusion: Most NAFLD patients had very poor or poor CRF. Severe liver injury (NAS ≥5) and sedentary lifestyle were independently associated with very poor/poor fitness, according to ET. No reproducibility was observed between the CRF defined by ET and 6MWT. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS",6-minute walk test; Cardiorespiratory fitness; Ergometric test; Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; Physical fitness,adult; aged; Article; bicycle ergometry; cardiorespiratory fitness; clinical article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; female; hepatitis; human; liver biopsy; male; metabolic equivalent; nonalcoholic fatty liver; obesity; reproducibility; sedentary lifestyle; six minute walk test,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Impact of Exercise and Lifestyle Changes on Health Conditions

Goal-directed training can provide intrinsically motivating balance activities but may not equally challenge balance for all age groups. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to quantify age-specific effects of dynamic balance training with real-time visual feedback. Kinematics, muscle activity, and user perceptions were collected for forty healthy adults (20 younger, 18–39 years; 20 older, 58–74 years), who performed a single balance training session with or without real-time visual feedback. Feedback involved controlling either a physical mobile robot or screen-based virtual ball through a course with standing tilt motions from an instrumented wobble board. Dynamic balance training was more challenging for older compared to younger adults, as measured by significantly higher dorsiflexor and knee extensor muscle activity and ankle co-contractions (50%–80%, p < 0.05). Older participants also performed more motion while training without feedback compared to younger adults (22%–65%, p<0.05). Robotic and virtual real-time visual feedback elicited similar biomechanical adaptations in older adults, reducing motions to similar levels as younger adults and increasing ankle co-contractions (p<0.05). Despite higher muscular demand, perceived physical exertion and high enjoyment levels (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory >0.80) were consistent across groups. However, robotic visual feedback may be more challenging than virtual feedback based on more frequent balance corrections, lower perceived competence, and lower game scores for older compared to younger adults. These findings collectively support the feedback system's potential to provide engaging and challenging at-home balance training across the lifespan. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Aging; Goal-directed; Muscle activation; Therapy; Wobble board,"Age Factors; Aged; Exercise Therapy; Feedback, Sensory; Humans; Postural Balance; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Robotics; Accident prevention; Biomechanics; Dynamics; E-learning; Motivation; Muscle; Robotics; Visual communication; Balance training; Co-contraction; Dynamic balance; Goal-directed; Muscle activation; Muscle activities; Real time visual feedback; Therapy; Wobble board; Young adults; adult; age distribution; aged; Article; biomechanics; body equilibrium; competence; controlled study; dorsiflexor muscle; dynamic balance training; extensor muscle; female; human; human experiment; kinematics; knee extensor muscle; lifespan; male; motivation; muscle contraction; muscle exercise; muscle function; normal human; physiotherapy; quantitative study; robotic real time visual feedback; skeletal muscle; virtual real time visual feedback; visual feedback; age; kinesiotherapy; physiology; robot assisted surgery; robotics; sensory feedback; Feedback","""Balance, Mobility, and Fall Risks in Aging and Musculoskeletal Conditions""",Impact and Control of Chronic Low Back Pain and Balance in Older Adults,Impact of Visual and Virtual Reality Interventions in Sports and Rehabilitation

Using a new sports legging embedded with an intelligent system for electrostimulation, localised heating and compression (completely embodied into the textile structures), we aimed to analyse acute recovery following a fatigue protocol. Surface electromyography- and torque-related variables were recorded on eight recreational athletes. A fatigue protocol conducted in an isokinetic dynamometer allowed us to examine isometric torque and consequent post-exercise acute recovery after using the sports legging. Regarding peak torque, no differences were found between post-fatigue and post-recovery assessments in any variable; however, pre-fatigue registered a 16% greater peak torque when compared with post-fatigue for localised heating and compression recovery methods.

Methods: Patients that underwent surgery for recurrent patellar instability at one centre with a uniform technique between 2004 and 2020 were included. Eligible patients were assessed by clinical examination and the disease-specific Banff Patellofemoral Instability Instrument 2.0 (BPII 2.0). Pre- and postoperative radiographs were analysed for patellofemoral osteoarthritis (OA) according to Iwano. Preoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and radiographs were analysed for anatomical risk factors for patellar instability. Student t-test, chi-square test and ANOVA-analyses were used to investigate whether anatomical risk factors and/or patient characteristics could predict an inferior outcome. Results: Forty-six patients (47 knees) were included at a mean follow-up time of 6.6 years (SD 4.6; range 1–17). Mean BPII 2.0 score was 60.4 (SD 18.4; range 26–98), and 10.6% (n = 5) had suffered a postoperative redislocation. Progression to evident patellofemoral OA was seen in 15% of the patients (p < 0.05). The presence of pathoanatomic risk factors did not correlate with recurrent postoperative instability or inferior BPII 2.0 score at the final evaluation. Conclusion: Patients treated with the current approach reported acceptable medium- to long-term results, but the risk of patellofemoral OA progression is significant. These findings add to the knowledge of expected outcomes after procedures involving Insall proximal realignment, and can guide clinical decision making for surgeons using similar methods.

Out of the different techniques, throwing is the most important one to be able to score. The objective of the study was to investigate the relationships between core muscle strength endurance (Bourban test: ventral, dorsal and lateral chain) and shoulder mobility/stability (Upper Quarter Y Balance test [YBT-UQ]) as well as throwing velocity in adolescent male sub-elite handball players (N = 32, age: 17.1 ± 0.7 years, height: 181.8 ± 6.3 cm, BMI: 24.6 ± 4.9 kg/m2). All participants were free of injuries at least two weeks prior to the study, experienced (training experience: 8.5 ± 3.3 years) handball players who were tested mid-season in the evening of one of their training sessions. Pearson correlations were calculated for core muscle strength endurance with (a) shoulder mobility/stability and (b) throwing velocity. The throwing arm reach displayed significant correlations (both p < 0.05) between the Bourban test (ventral chain) and the inferolateral reach direction (IL) of the YBT-UQ (r = 0.41) as well as the composite score (CS) (r = 0.34). For the dorsal chain, significant correlations (all p < 0.01) were found for the medial (MD) (r = 0.42) and IL (r = 0.61) reach direction as well as the CS (r = 0.51). For the right but not the left side of the lateral chain, significant correlations (both p < 0.05) were detected for the IL reach direction (r = 0.40) and the CS (r = 0.35). For the non-throwing arm reach, significant correlations were found between the ventral chain and the MD reach direction (r = 0.53, p < 0.01) as well as the CS (r = 0.31, p < 0.05). For the dorsal chain, significant correlations (all p < 0.01) were found for the MD (r = 0.47) and IL (r = 0.44) reach direction as well as the CS (r = 0.41). For the lateral chain, significant correlations were detected for the MD (left and right side: r = 0.49, p < 0.01) and IL (left and right side: r = 0.35, p < 0.05) reach direction as well as the CS (left and right side: r = 0.37, p < 0.05). The dorsal chain but not the ventral and lateral chain of the Bourban test showed a significant correlation with throwing velocity (r = 0.33, p < 0.05). Our results indicate that better core muscle strength endurance is associated with better shoulder mobility/stability as well as partially higher throwing velocity of adolescent male sub-elite handball players. Therefore, practitioners should integrate core muscle strength endurance exercises into the training routines to improve upper-extremity performance of this target group.

Methods: Male recreational runners (n = 587) participating in the Hokkaido Marathon 2017 completed a questionnaire before the race; of these, 494 finished the race. We assessed age, running career, body height, body weight, body mass index (BMI), monthly training volume, training frequency, the LRD and the ARD. These indicators were each divided into 4 or 5 homogeneous subgroups to determine whether the other indicators in each subgroup predicted marathon time. Results: In the training frequency subgroups, there were significant correlations between monthly training volume, the LRD or the ARD and marathon time, except for the subgroup that trained 2 times per week or less; in this subgroup, the relationship between the ARD and marathon time was not significant. In all monthly training volume subgroups, there were no significant relationships between training frequency, the LRD or the ARD and marathon time. In the ≥ 21 km LRD and ≥ 10 km ARD subgroups, there were significant correlations between monthly training volume and marathon time (all P < 0.01); these correlations were not significant in the 1–20 km LRD and < 10 km ARD subgroups. Conclusion: These results indicate that monthly training volume is the most important factor in predicting marathon time and that the influence of monthly training volume is only significant if the running distance per workout exceeded a certain level. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Body mass index; Performance; Running; Training indices,Body Mass Index; Body Weight; Humans; Male; Marathon Running; Physical Education and Training; Surveys and Questionnaires; body mass; body weight; human; male; marathon runner; physical education; questionnaire,"""Analysis of Biomechanics, Exercise Techniques, and Physiological Adaptations in Various Physical Activities""",Lower Limb Muscle Strength and Biomechanics Studies,Physiological and Biomechanical Responses in Sports Performance

Method: A total of 194 patients undergoing primary TKA were included in this retrospective study. Sociodemographic data documented were age, gender, body mass index, living situation, and the clinical diagnosis. Factors affecting patient constitution and laboratory data for serum level of Hb and CRP were assessed preoperatively and postoperatively. In addition, we collected patients’ data for attendance of patient education, planned discharge to rehabilitation facilities, and levels of postoperative pain. Results: In univariate group comparisons, prolonged LOS was significantly associated with increased age, elevated C-reactive-Protein-level, and decreased haemoglobin level. Patients experiencing prolonged LOS also showed significant association with higher prevalence of comorbidities, female gender, living as widow, preoperative anticoagulation, requirement of blood transfusion, and planned discharge to rehabilitation facilities. However, after multivariate logistic regression, only planned discharge to rehabilitation facility, non-attendance of preoperative patient education, female gender, and increased pain levels were identified as significant predictors for prolonged LOS. Conclusion: Efficient pain therapy and thorough patient education have a positive effect on treatment outcome after TKA in a RR-setting. © 2022, The Author(s).",Length of stay; Rapid recovery surgery; Risk factors; Total knee arthroplasty,"Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Length of Stay; Pain; Patient Discharge; Retrospective Studies; acetylsalicylic acid; bupivacaine; C reactive protein; dexamethasone; enoxaparin; hemoglobin; hydromorphone; ropivacaine; tranexamic acid; adult; aged; anemia; Article; blood transfusion; body mass; Charlson Comorbidity Index; cohort analysis; comorbidity; demography; disseminated intravascular clotting; female; hemoglobin blood level; hospital discharge; human; hyperproteinorrhachia; hypertension; length of stay; major clinical study; male; multivariate logistic regression analysis; operative blood loss; outcome assessment; postoperative complication; postoperative pain; preoperative evaluation; Rapid Recovery; risk factor; subarachnoid hemorrhage; total knee arthroplasty; treatment outcome; very elderly; knee replacement; length of stay; pain; retrospective study","""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Hip Arthroscopy Outcomes and Rehabilitation

However, for assessing punch performance, no study has been carried out to date. The purpose of this study was to analyse the reliability of the GymAware linear transducer for the measurement of barbell velocity during the landmine push throw (LPT) test using four loads. Methods: Twenty-five healthy, physically active male students, aged 24.13 ± 2.82 years, volunteered to take part in this study. The reliability of the LPT test was measured at two separate visits, with a 2-day interval between them. One series of the test protocol included four parts of the LPT test with progressively increasing loads (20, 25, 30, and 35 kg) and 5 min intervals for rests between loads. Results: For all four loads, excellent intra-rater and test–retest reliability was noted for the mean force variable (ICC = 0.97–0.99). Additionally, very strong and significant correlations were established between measurements (r = 0.96–0.99). Poor reliability was observed for barbell height and total work (ICC below 0.5). A trend of decreasing reliability was detected with increasing barbell load. Furthermore, measurements without the barbell throw were more reliable than those with it. Conclusions: These results support the use of the GymAware linear transducer to track barbell velocity during the LPT test. This device may have valuable practical applications for strength and conditioning coaches. Therefore, we suggest that the LPT assessed with the GymAware linear transducer may be a useful method for evaluating upper limb strength and power during boxing punches. © 2023 by the authors.",GymAware linear transducer; landmine punch throw test; punch strength; reliability; sport; training,,"""Analysis of Biomechanics, Exercise Techniques, and Physiological Adaptations in Various Physical Activities""",Lower Limb Muscle Strength and Biomechanics Studies,Muscle Strength and Recovery in Sports Performance

Methods: The population-based study sample included 2050 participants aged 18–74 from the Finnish national Health 2011 study. Physical fitness was assessed by the single leg stand test, the modified push-up test, the vertical jump test and the six-minute walk test, and perceived work ability was assessed via interview. Logistic regression was used for examining the associations between physical fitness and work ability. Results: After adjusting for potential confounders (age, sex, marital status, educational level, work characteristics, total physical activity, daily smoking, BMI and number of diseases), odds ratios indicated that good work ability was more likely among those who had better balance in single leg stand test (OR = 1.54; 95% CI 1.07–2.24), and who belonged in the high fitness thirds in six-minute walking test (OR = 2.08; 95% CI 1.24–3.49) and in vertical jump test (OR = 2.51; 95% CI 1.23–5.12) compared to lowest third.

CS can be divided into acute forms, most commonly due to trauma and considered an orthopaedic emergency, and chronic forms, most commonly presenting in athletes with recurrent exercise-induced pain. Downstream pathophysiological mechanisms are complex but do share commonalities with mechanisms implicated in genetic neuromuscular disorders. Here we present 3 patients with recurrent CS in the context of a RYR1-related disorder (n = 1) and PYGM-related McArdle disease (n = 2), two of whom presented many years before the diagnosis of an underlying neuromuscular disorder was suspected.

In this study, a novel patterned equidistant micropillar substrate based on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is designed to mimic the collagen fiber-like network of the cartilage matrix. By changing the component of the curing agent to an oligomeric base, micropillar substrates with the same topology but different stiffnesses are obtained and it is found that chondrocytes seeded onto the soft micropillar substrate maintain their phenotype by gathering type II collagen and aggrecan more effectively than those seeded onto the stiff micropillar substrate. Moreover, chondrocytes sense and respond to micropillar substrates with different stiffnesses by altering the ECM-cytoskeleton-focal adhesion axis. Further, it is found that the soft substrate-preserved chondrocyte phenotype is dependent on the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Finally, it is indicated that the changes in osteoid-like region formation and cartilage phenotype loss in the stiffened sclerotic area of osteoarthritis cartilage to validate the changes triggered by micropillar substrates with different stiffnesses.

A fixed dynamometer represents a valid and inexpensive assessment method. However, it has not been studied whether posture and grip modality influence shoulder muscle strength. The aim of this study was to compare shoulder strength values between sitting and standing positions and between the handle and cuff grip modalities. A total of 40 volunteers were divided into a posture (PG) and a handle-cuff group (HCG). Participants in the PG were asked to perform a maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) for shoulder flexion, extension, ab-adduction, and intra-extra rotation in standing and sitting positions. The HCG participants were tested in a standing position while holding a handle or with a cuff around their wrist. PG showed higher forces in the standing position for shoulder flexion (p = 0.009); internal rotation showed higher values in the sitting position (p = 0.003). ER/IR ratio was significantly higher in the standing position (p < 0.001). HCG showed higher significant forces during cuff modality in all positions and grip modalities, including the ER/IR ratio (p < 0.05). Different body positions and grip modalities influenced the assessment of shoulder strength as recorded by a fixed dynamometer; therefore, these factors should be carefully considered when carrying out a shoulder strength assessment, and we encourage the development of assessment guidelines to make future clinical trial results comparable. © 2023 by the authors.",assessment; dynamometer; grip; MVIC; posture; shoulder; strength,,"""Muscle Strength, Endurance, and Injury Risk in Upper-Extremity Sports Performance""",Muscular Strength and Injury Risk in Athletes,Evaluation and Improvement of Postural Balance and Muscle Strength

However, evidence regarding their efficacy for rehabilitation is inconclusive. Objectives: This network meta-analysis (NMA) investigated the efficacy of exergames and VTAR on gait and balance outcomes and acceptability for patients with PD. Data sources: ClinicalKey, Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, ProQuest, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science and ClinicalTrials.gov. Study selection: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating changes in gait or balance parameters were included in this study. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: In the NMA, standardised mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using a frequentist model. GRADE ratings were used to evaluate the quality of evidence in this study. Results: Twenty-three RCTs with 949 participants were included. Exergames and VTAR were associated with significantly better improvements in balance and gait outcomes than usual treatment and other active control interventions. However, exergames were not associated with changes in depressive symptoms. The evaluation of acceptability results indicated that all exergames and VTAR were adequately tolerated, as indicated by the low drop-out rates. Limitations: Small sample sizes and heterogeneity were the key limitations of this study. Conclusion and implications of key findings: This NMA confirmed that exergames are associated with more favourable gait and balance outcomes in patients with PD compared with usual treatment and other active control interventions. GRADE ratings revealed that most direct, indirect and overall network evidence was of low to medium quality.

Currently, the burden of diabetes on healthcare systems is unprecedented and rising daily. Several observational studies and randomized controlled trials provide clinical evidence that T2DM remission is possible by adopting dietary interventions and a strict exercise training protocol. Notably, these studies provide ample evidence for remission in patients with T2DM or for prevention in those with risk factors for the disease through various non-pharmacological behavioural interventions. In this article, we present two clinical cases of individuals who showed remission from T2DM/prediabetes via behavioural changes, especially through the adoption of a low-energy diet and exercise.

Although there is strong evidence that all patients with OA should be offered adequate education and exercises as a first-line treatment, an effective self-management program, including structured education and therapeutic exercises, has not yet been introduced for individuals with wrist OA. This trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an exercise therapy program with joint protective strategies to improve neuromuscular control (intervention group) compared to a training program with range of motion exercises (control group). Methods: This is a single-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two treatment arms in patients with symptomatic and radiographically confirmed wrist OA. The trial will be conducted at a hand surgery department. The participants will be randomly assigned either to a neuromuscular exercise therapy program or to a training program with range of motion exercises only. Participants in both groups will receive a wrist orthosis and structured education on wrist anatomy, pathophysiology, and joint protective self-management strategies. The programs consist of home exercises that will be performed twice a day for 12 weeks. The Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) is the primary outcome measure of pain and function. Wrist range of motion (ROM), grip strength, the Numeric Pain Rating scale (NPRS), Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH), the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), Global Rating of Change (GROC), and conversion to surgery are the secondary measures of outcome. Assessments will be performed at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months after baseline by a blinded assessor. Discussion: The upcoming results from this trial may add new knowledge about the effectiveness of a self-managed exercise therapy program on pain and function for individuals with wrist OA. If the present self-management program proves to be effective, it can redefine current treatment strategies and may be implemented in wrist OA treatment protocols.

Methods: Between November 2019 and March 2021, 150 patients underwent PRP injections at our institution for refractory rotator cuff tendinopathy and partial rotator cuff tears (105 RCTs and 45 PTRCTs). The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, the Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) and The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were evaluated at 2-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Return to sports was also evaluated. An ultrasound examination was performed to evaluate structural outcomes 12 months after the injection. Results: The mean age was 36.6 years (±9.08). Overall, the ASES, VAS, SANE, and Pittsburgh scores showed statistical improvement after the injection (P < .01). Specifically, the improvement in the ASES score, which was the primary outcome measure was significantly greater in the group without tears than in the group with PTRCTs at all follow-up times. Moreover, 94% of the patients in the isolated RCT group and 49% in the PTRCTs group achieved a substantial clinical benefit at 12 months follow-up. Ten out of the 50 patients (20%) who received PRP injections due to a partial RC tear underwent surgery due to the lack of clinical improvement. Conclusions: Subacromial PRP injections produced a significant improvement in shoulder function, pain, and sleep disturbances in most patients with RCT refractory to conservative treatment that was maintained at the 12-month follow-up. Moreover, most patients returned to sports at the same level prior to injury. However, improvement in symptoms and functional outcomes was significantly worse in patients who had a PTRCT compared with patients who had an isolated tendinopathy.

Even though exercise in HD patients have shown remarkable benefits on hemodialysis adequacy, it is yet inconclusive if exercise can positively affect body composition parameters or if dialysis adequacy may affect body composition status. This study aimed to investigate the effect of a 6-month intradialytic exercise training program on dialysis adequacy indices and body composition parameters in HD patients. Study design: A total of 24 HD patients were randomly assigned into two equally sized groups. The exercise group (EX group) participated in a 6-month intradialytic moderate-intensity aerobic exercise training program at the beginning of the HD sessions, three times a week for 60 min, and maintained a Borg’s Rating of Perceived Exertion score between 13 and 14. The Control group (C group) remained untrained. At baseline, during, and at the end of the 6-month study, we assessed single-pool Kt/V, urea reduction ratio (URR), and body composition parameters, such as extracellular water (ECW)/ intracellular water (ICW) ratio, body mass index (BMI) and lean tissue mass (LTM). In all patients, the 6-min-walking test (6MWT) was performed as a marker of physical performance. Results: A significant increase of both Kt/V (increase by 19%, p = 0.01), and URR (increase by 7%, p = 0.03) values has been observed in the EX group after the 6-month training program. Similarly, a statistically significant increase in 6MWT distance (from 442 ± 67 m to 481 ± 68 m, p = 0.02) in the EX group has also been found, compared to the C group (from 393 ± 59 m to 427 ± 81 m, p = 0.06). Neither EX nor C group has shown significant changes in body composition parameters.

Digital light processing (DLP) printing technology has been widely used in bone tissue engineering (BTE) due to its high printing resolution and gentle printing process. As commonly used bioinks, synthetic polymers such as polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) and Pluronic F127 diacrylate (F127DA) have satisfactory printability and mechanical properties but usually lack sufficient adhesion to cells and tissues. Here, a compound BTE scaffold based on PEGDA, F127DA, and gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) was successfully prepared using DLP printing technology. The scaffold not only facilitated the adhesion and proliferation of cells, but also effectively promoted the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells in an osteoinductive environment. Moreover, the bone tissue volume/total tissue volume (BV/TV) of the GelMA/PEGDA/F127DA (GPF) scaffold in vivo was 49.75 ± 8.50%, higher than the value of 37.10 ± 7.27% for the PEGDA/F127DA (PF) scaffold and 20.43 ± 2.08% for the blank group. Therefore, the GPF scaffold prepared using DLP printing technology provides a new approach to the treatment of bone defects. © 2023 by the authors.",biomaterials; bone regeneration; bone tissue engineering; digital light processing,biomaterial; methacrylic acid; pluronic F127 diacrylate; polyethylene glycol diacrylate; polymer; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal tissue; Article; bone defect; bone development; bone regeneration; bone tissue; cell adhesion; cell culture; cell proliferation; cell viability; controlled study; in vivo study; mesenchymal stem cell; mouse; nonhuman; three dimensional printing; tissue engineering,Advancements in Therapies and Technologies for Osteoarthritis and Joint Disorders,Therapeutic Interventions and Their Efficacy in Osteoarthritis Treatment,Advances in Tissue Regeneration and Healing in Musculoskeletal Disorders

We included 619 individuals (69.8 ± 5.6 years) living in the Autonomous Region of Madeira, Portugal. The frequency of falls was obtained by self-report. BB was determined by the Fullerton Advanced Balance scale, while GSR was established by dividing cadence by gait speed and data collected during the 50-foot walk test. Males indicated a lower prevalence of falls in the last 12 months (23.6%), while females had a higher score (48.7%), as well as a lower balance performance (p < 0.001) and higher GSR scores (p < 0.001). Lower BB control (p < 0.001), as well as higher GSR, were more expressive for fallers (p < 0.001). We found a large, negative and significant correlation between GSR and BB for historical falls (r = −0.560; p < 0.001), and between male and female cohorts (r = −0.507; p < 0.001). The total effect of sex on falls mediated by GSR and BB was 16.4%. Consequently, GSR and BB mediated this association by approximately 74.0% and 22.5%, respectively. © 2023 by the authors.",aging; falls; gait pattern; postural control; sex differences; vulnerability,aged; aging; article; controlled study; fall risk; female; gait; human; human experiment; Madeira; major clinical study; male; prevalence; self report; sex difference; vulnerability; walk test; walking speed,"""Balance, Mobility, and Fall Risks in Aging and Musculoskeletal Conditions""",Impact and Control of Chronic Low Back Pain and Balance in Older Adults,Fall Prevention and Balance Improvement in the Elderly

Methods: Twelve team sport athletes completed a linear and multidirectional running trial during which movement characteristics, oxygen consumption ((Formula presented.)), blood lactate (B[La]) and heart rate (HR) were measured. Isometric peak torque of knee extensors and flexors was also assessed before and after each trial. Results: High speed running distance was higher during the linear trial (p < 0.001), whereas time at high metabolic power (p = 0.046), number of accelerations (p < 0.001), summated HR (p = 0.003) and B[La] (p = 0.002) were higher during the multidirectional trial. Integrated external to internal ratios of high-speed running: summated HR and high-speed running: total (Formula presented.) were different between multidirectional and linear trials (p ≤ 0.001). Conversely, high metabolic power: summated HR and high metabolic power: total (Formula presented.) were similar (p ≥ 0.246). Small decrements in knee flexor (p = 0.003) and extensor torque (p = 0.004) were observed after both trials. Conclusion: Time at high metabolic power better reflects the increased internal response during running with more directional changes than high speed running. © 2022 The Author(s).

However, questions arise on the use of VR in multimodal postsurgical pain management. Optimizing VR for pain management requires an understanding of intervention- and context-specific factors, based on patients’ needs and expectations after major surgery. This substudy is part of a randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of three VR interventions as an add-on, self-administered treatment for postsurgical pain. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to evaluate VR effects, software, hardware, prescriptions, and factors affecting the implementation of VR. Experiences across interventions were compared to identify relevant factors for successful implementation. Patients benefitted from self-administered VR in postsurgical pain management in various aspects and without serious drawbacks. Participants preferred an intuitive, 3D, 360-degree VR device with a large choice of applications matching their interests. The preferred frequency and duration of VR use was 2–3 sessions a day for 10–15 min each. Adjusting the VR use to individuals’ needs and contexts was reported to be key for successful implementation, with attention paid to improving the awareness of VR as a non-pharmacological means of promoting postsurgical recovery among patients and healthcare professionals. © 2023 by the authors.",multimodal pain management; postsurgical pain management; Virtual Reality,adult; analgesia; Article; awareness; controlled study; female; hospital patient; human; major surgery; male; postoperative pain; prescription; qualitative research; randomized controlled trial; semi structured interview; software; virtual reality,"""Virtual Reality and Exergames in Rehabilitation and Exercise""",Virtual Reality Interventions in Motor Rehabilitation and Sports for Older Adults,Impact of Visual and Virtual Reality Interventions in Sports and Rehabilitation

While advances in SRC blood biomarkers are being made in adult populations, less data are available for adolescents. Clinical validation of blood biomarkers post-SRC will first require investigation in a healthy uninjured state. Further, rapid pubertal changes during adolescence may implicate possible interactions with circulating sex hormones and the menstrual cycle for females. This cross-sectional study aimed to characterize pre-injury plasma levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light (NF-L), ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1), total tau (T-tau), and phosphorylated tau-181 (P-tau-181), considering previous concussion, age, and sex in healthy adolescent sport participants. Possible associations with menstrual cycle phase and circulating sex hormone levels (i.e., progesterone, estradiol, testosterone) were also explored. Pre-injury blood samples were obtained from 149 healthy adolescents (48% female, ages 11-18) participating in a larger Surveillance in High Schools and Community Sports to Reduce Concussions and their Consequences (SHRed Concussions) multi-site longitudinal cohort study. Main outcomes were natural log (ln) transformed plasma GFAP, NF-L, UCH-L1, T-tau, and P-tau-181 concentrations, quantified on the Quanterix Simoa HD-X platform. Mixed-effects multi-variable linear regression was used to assess associations between biomarkers and self-reported previous concussion (yes/no), age (years), sex (male/female), objectively determined menstrual cycle phase (follicular/luteal), plasma progesterone, estradiol, and testosterone. Males had 19.8% lower UCH-L1 (β = -0.221, 95% confidence interval [CI; -0.396, -0.046]), 18.9% lower GFAP (β = -0.210, 95% CI [-0.352, -0.068]), and 21.8% higher P-tau-181 (β = 0.197, 95% CI [0.048, 0.346]) compared with females, adjusting for age and previous concussion. GFAP decreased 9.5% with each 1-year increase in age, adjusting for previous concussion and sex (β = -0.100, 95% CI [-0.152, -0.049]). No biomarkers were associated with a history of previous concussion. Exploratory investigations found no associations between biomarkers and menstrual cycle phase. Females displayed an age-adjusted negative association between T-tau and progesterone (β = -0.010, 95% CI [-0.018, -0.002]), whereas males had a negative age-adjusted association between UCH-L1 and testosterone (β = -0.020, 95% CI [-0.037, -0.002]). As such, age- and sex-specific reference intervals may be warranted for pediatric athlete populations prior to clinical validation of blood biomarkers for SRC. Additionally, hormonal associations highlight the need to consider puberty and development in adolescent studies. Overall, findings suggest these biomarkers are resilient to a history of previous concussion and menstrual cycle phase, supporting continued investigation in adolescent SRC. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",fluid biomarkers; menstrual cycle; pediatric; sex hormones; sport-related concussion,Adolescent; Adult; Biomarkers; Brain Concussion; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Progesterone; Testosterone; Ubiquitin Thiolesterase; biological marker; estradiol; glial fibrillary acidic protein; neurofilament protein; progesterone; tau protein; testosterone; ubiquitin thiolesterase; biological marker; glial fibrillary acidic protein; progesterone; testosterone; ubiquitin thiolesterase; adolescent; adult; age; Article; blood sampling; brain concussion; child; cohort analysis; confidence interval; controlled study; cross-sectional study; disease surveillance; estradiol blood level; exploratory research; female; follicular phase; high school; human; longitudinal study; luteal phase; major clinical study; male; medical history; multiple linear regression analysis; pediatric patient; progesterone blood level; protein blood level; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; puberty; quantitative analysis; reference value; self report; sex; testosterone blood level; validation process; youth sport,"""Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion: Studies on Impacts, Recovery, and Influences""",Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion Studies in Young Athletes,Post-Concussion Symptoms and Recovery in Adolescents

Feasibility of intensive longitudinal case studies in forensic psychiatry,2023,Frontiers in Psychiatry,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159965011&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyt.2023.1111602&partnerID=40&md5=cb02f192b598de88af00c1b30e9584d7,"Physical exercise interventions improve quality of life in people with mental disorders and improve abstinence and cravings in substance use disorders patients in both the short term and long term. In people with mental illness, physical exercise interventions significantly reduce psychiatric symptoms of schizophrenia and symptoms of anxiety. For forensic psychiatry, there is little empirical evidence supporting mental health-enhancing effects of physical exercise interventions. Interventional studies in forensic psychiatry deal mainly with three problems: heterogeneity of the individuals, a small sample size, and a low compliance rate. Intensive longitudinal case studies could be a suitable approach to address these methodological challenges in forensic psychiatry. This study uses an intensive longitudinal design to determine whether forensic psychiatric patients are content to complete several data assessments per day over the course of several weeks. The feasibility of this approach is operationalized by the compliance rate. Additionally, single-case studies examine the effects of sports therapy (ST) on momentary affective states (energetic arousal, valence, and calmness). The results of these case studies reveal one aspect of feasibility and offer insights into the effects of forensic psychiatric ST on the affective states among patients with different conditions. The patients’ momentary affective states were recorded before (PRE), after (POST) and 1 h after (FoUp1h) ST by questionnaires. Ten individuals (Mage = 31.7, SD = 11.94; 60% male) participated in the study. A total of 130 questionnaires were completed. To perform the single-case studies, data of three patients were considered. Repeated-measures ANOVA was performed for the individual affective states to test for main effects of ST. Due to the results, ST has no significant effect on none of the three affect dimensions. However, effect sizes varied between small to medium (energetic arousal: η2 = 0.01, η2 = 0.07, η2 = 0.06; valence: η2 = 0.07; calmness: η2 = 0.02) in the three patients. Intensive longitudinal case studies are a possible approach to address heterogeneity and the low sample size. The low compliance rate in this study reveals that the study design needs to be optimized for future studies.

Materials and Methods: Thirty-four prostate cancer patients (70 ± 7 years) were assessed shortly after initiation of androgen deprivation therapy and again 5 months thereafter. Measurements consisted of whole-body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (body composition), computed tomography scanning of the upper leg (muscle mass), one-repetition maximum leg press (muscle strength), cardiopulmonary exercise testing (aerobic capacity), blood draws (metabolic parameters), accelerometry (habitual physical activity) and questionnaires (health-related quality-of-life). Data were analyzed with Student’s paired t-tests. Results: Over time, whole-body fat mass (from 26.2 ± 7.7 to 28.4 ± 8.3 kg, p < 0.001) and fasting insulin (from 9.5 ± 5.8 to 11.3 ± 6.9 mU/L, p < 0.001) increased. Declines were observed for quadriceps cross-sectional area (from 66.3 ± 9.1 to 65.0 ± 8.5 cm2, p < 0.01), one-repetition maximum leg press (from 107 ± 27 to 100 ± 27 kg, p < 0.01), peak oxygen uptake (from 23.2 ± 3.7 to 20.3 ± 3.4 mL/min/kg body weight, p < 0.001), step count (from 7,048 ± 2,277 to 5,842 ± 1,749 steps/day, p < 0.01) and health-related quality-of-life (from 84.6 ± 13.5 to 77.0 ± 14.6, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Androgen deprivation therapy induces adverse changes in body composition, muscle strength, cardiometabolic health and health-related quality-of-life already within 5 months after the start of treatment, possibly largely contributed by diminished habitual physical activity. Prostate cancer patients should, therefore, be stimulated to increase their habitual physical activity immediately after initiation of androgen deprivation therapy, to limit adverse side-effects and to improve health-related quality-of-life. © 2023 The Author(s).

The optimal frequency and intensity of training for patients when using the ankle robot is not known which can affect rehabilitation outcome. OBJECTIVE: To explore the optimal ankle robot training protocol on foot drop in stroke subjects. METHODS: Subjects were randomly divided into four groups, with 9 in each group. The subjects received different intensities (low or high intensity) with frequencies (1 session/day or 2 sessions/day) of robot combination training. Each session lasted 20 minutes and all subjects were trained 5 days a week for 3 weeks. RESULTS: After 3 weeks of treatment, all groups showed an improvement in passive and active ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (PROM and AROM) and Fugl-Meyer Assessment for lower extremity (FMA-LE) compared to pre-treatment. When training at the same level of intensity, patients who received 2 sessions/day of training had better improvement in ankle dorsiflexion PROM than those who received 1 session/day. In terms of the improvement in dorsiflexion AROM and FMA-LE, patients who received 2 sessions/day with high intensity training improved better than other protocols.

Retrospective multicenter study. Objective. We reviewed 15-year trends in operative factors, radiographic and quality of life outcomes, and complication rates in children with cerebral palsy (CP)-related scoliosis who underwent spinal fusion. Summary of Background Data. Over the past two decades, significant efforts have been made to decrease complications and improve outcomes of this population. Materials and Methods. We retrospectively reviewed a multicenter registry of pediatric CP patients who underwent spinal fusion from 2008 to 2020. We evaluated baseline and operative, hospitalization, and complication data as well as radiographic and quality of life outcomes at a minimum 2-year follow-up. Results. Mean estimated blood loss and transfusion volume declined from 2.7±2.0 L in 2008 to 0.71±0.34 L in 2020 and 1.0±0.5 L in 2008 to 0.5±0.2 L in 2020, respectively, with a concomitant increase in antifibrinolytic use from 58% to 97% (all, P<0.01). Unit rod and pelvic fusion use declined from33% in 2008 to 0%in 2020 and 96%in 2008 to 79% in 2020, respectively (both, P<0.05). Mean postoperative intubation time declined from 2.5±2.6 to 0.42±0.63 days (P<0.01). No changes were observed in preoperative and postoperative coronal angle and pelvic obliquity, operative time, frequency of anterior/anterior- posterior approach, and durations of hospital and intensive care unit stays. Improvements in the Caregiver Priorities and Child Health Index of Life with Disabilities postoperatively did not change significantly over the study period. Complication rates, including reoperation, superficial and deep surgical site infection, and gastrointestinal and medical complications remained stable over the study period. Conclusions. Over the past 15 years of CP scoliosis surgery, surgical blood loss, transfusion volumes, duration of postoperative intubation, and pelvic fusion rates have decreased. However, the degree of radiographic correction, the rates of surgical and medical complications (including infection), and health-related quality of life measures have broadly remained constant. © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Methods: A retrospective review of patients who underwent ABR between 2012 and 2017 was performed to identify patients who had recurrence of instability following stabilisation (Group 1). These were pair-matched in a 2:1 ratio for age, gender and sport with a control (Group 2) who underwent ABR without recurrence. Preoperative MRAs were evaluated for risk factors for recurrence, with glenoid bone loss and Hill–Sachs lesions also measured. Multilinear and multilogistic regression models were used to evaluate factors affecting recurrence. Results: Overall, 72 patients were included in this study, including 48 patients without recurrence and 24 patients with recurrent instability. There was a significant difference between the two groups in mean glenoid bone loss (Group 1: 7.3% vs. Group 2: 5.7%, p < 0.0001) and the rate of off-track Hill–Sachs lesions (Group 1: 20.8% vs. Group 2: 0%, p = 0.0003). Of the variables analysed in logistic regression, increased glenoid anteversion (p = 0.02), acromioclavicular (AC) degeneration (p = 0.03) and increased Hill–Sachs width were associated with increased risk of failure. Increased chondral version (p = 0.01) and humeral head diameter in the anteriorposterior view were found to be protective and associated with a greater likelihood of success. Conclusion: Glenoid anteversion was a risk factor for recurrent instability, whereas increased chondral version and humeral head diameter were associated with higher rates of success following ABR. Glenoid bone loss, presence of an off-track Hill–Sachs lesion, increased Hill–Sachs width and AC degeneration were also associated with failure. These findings should be used by surgeons to stratify risk for recurrence following ABR.

The purpose of this study was to examine the activities of the superficial shoulder muscles in addition to internal rotation strength during two belly-press and three lift-off test positions. Methods: Thirteen healthy young adult men (age 29.5 ± 5.4 years) were recruited for the present study. They performed isometric shoulder internal rotation against manual resistance during the belly-press test positions with two different resistance locations and the lift-off test with three different arm positions. The surface electromyographic activities of the superficial shoulder muscles, including the deltoid (anterior, middle, posterior), pectoralis major, long head of triceps and latissimus dorsi muscle, were collected and compared between the two belly-press tests, and among the three lift-off test positions (P < 0.05). Results: The belly-press test position with resistance to elbow showed significantly greater activities of the anterior and middle deltoid muscle than the original belly-press test; but showed significantly smaller activities of pectoralis major, triceps and latissimus dorsi muscle than the original belly-press test. Among the three lift-off tests, all muscle activities, except for the pectoralis major, were greater in the lift-off at L4/5 than in the lift-off at buttock and thigh. Lift-off at thigh showed significantly smaller activity of pectoralis major than the lift-off at L4/5 and buttock. Conclusions: The findings of the present study suggest that clinician should give attention to compensatory motions by excessive shoulder extensor and adductor muscle activities for the original belly press test, by excessive deltoid muscle activities for the modified belly-press, and by excessive shoulder extensor muscle activities for the lift off test in the inferior arm positions. © 2021 The Japanese Orthopaedic Association",,"Adult; Electromyography; Humans; Male; Muscle Strength; Muscle, Skeletal; Range of Motion, Articular; Rotator Cuff; Shoulder; Shoulder Joint; Young Adult; adult; article; attention; buttock; controlled study; deltoid muscle; elbow; extensor muscle; human; human experiment; latissimus dorsi muscle; male; muscle function; pectoralis major muscle; rotation; thigh; triceps brachii muscle; young adult; electromyography; joint characteristics and functions; muscle strength; physiology; rotator cuff; shoulder; skeletal muscle","""Muscle Strength, Endurance, and Injury Risk in Upper-Extremity Sports Performance""",Muscular Strength and Injury Risk in Athletes,Shoulder Pathologies and Treatment Techniques

The Pedi-IKDC was originally developed in the English language and its main construct is functional assessment of knee disorders in children and adolescents. Material and Methods: The original English version of the questionnaire was translated to European Portuguese using the forward-backwards method. Patients aged eight to 17 with knee disorders were considered eligible for the study. An online platform was implemented to collect patient responses, including general patient information, the questionnaires Pedi-IKDC, EuroQol-5 Dimension Youth and Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire. Three surveys were sent: at the moment of first evaluation (T0), after two (T1) and ten (T2) weeks. These surveys followed the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments - COSMIN Checklist recommendations. The internal consistency, reliability, error of measurement, structural and construct validity (by means of correlation with previously validated scales), responsiveness and interpretability (floor/ceiling effects, MIC and ROC curve) were evaluated. Results: Forty-seven patients completed T0, 42 patients completed T1 and 40 patients completed T2. The factorial analysis confirmed that the scale has one dimension. Cronbach alpha (α) was 0.94; interclass correlation coefficient was 0.92; smallest detectable change was 19.04 for individuals and 3.31 for groups; standard error of measurement was 6.87; minimum important change was 18.48; floor and ceiling effects were absent. More than 75% of the hypotheses tested for construct validity were confirmed, showing its adequacy. The variation of scores between T0 and T2 correlated with the clinical evolution of the participants (r = 0.421, p < 0.05). Conclusion: The Portuguese version of Pedi-IKDC demonstrated good psychometric properties, being a valuable tool for clinical assessment of pediatric patients with knee disorder. © 2023 CELOM.

Low physical activity in patients with claudication is associated with lower walking abilities as assessed by the treadmill test. The impact of physical activity on the ability to walk in a natural environment is unknown. The study aimed to assess the level of daily physical activity among patients with claudication, as well as the relationship between the level of daily physical activity and claudication distance measured during the outdoor walking and treadmill tests. Materials and method. The study included 37 patients (24 males), aged 70.03±5.9, with intermittent claudication. Daily step count was assessed using the Garmin Vivofit activity monitor, worn on the non-dominant wrist for 7 consecutive days. Pain-free walking distance (PFWDTT) and maximal walking distance (MWDTT) were measured via the treadmill test. During 60-minute outdoor walking, the maximal walking distance (MWDGPS), total walking distance (TWDGPS), walking speed (WSGPS), number of stops (NSGPS) and stop durations (SDGPS) were assessed. Results. Mean daily step count – 7,102±3,433. A significant correlation was observed between daily step count and MWDTT, TWDGPS (R=0.33, R=0.37, respectively (p<0.05). Furthermore, 51% of patients reached less than 7,500 steps/day and presented significantly shorter MWDTT, MWDGPS and TWDGPS, compared to the participants covering ≥7,500 steps (p<0.05). Conclusions. The daily step count reflects claudication distance measured on a treadmill and only partially in a community outdoor setting. The minimal daily step count that should be recommended for patients with claudication, allowing achievement of significantly better results with regard to walking abilities, both on the treadmill and in outdoor settings, is at least 7,500 steps per day. © 2023, Institute of Agricultural Medicine.

Associations between rank, sex, and parity with musculoskeletal injuries sustained during annual military physical fitness test. J Strength Cond Res 38(2): 367–373, 2024—Musculoskeletal injuries pose a significant threat to the well-being of military personnel. Attempts to use physical employment standard test results as predictors of injury are underway, but little is known about injuries sustained during the tests. This study sought to identify body regions most likely to be reported as injured during the annual Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) physical fitness evaluation. In addition, sex, rank, and parity status are explored as possible associated factors for injury. A total of 1, 796 actively serving CAF members were categorized by sex (1, 030 male participants; 766 female participants), rank (1, 142 Non-Commissioned Members [NCM]; 638 Officers), and parity (314 parous female participants; 435 nulliparous female participants). Sex, rank, and parity were associated with body regions reportedly injured during an annual CAF fitness assessment (significance p # 0.05). When compared with male participants, female participants were more likely to be injured {aOR: 1.797 (95% [confidence interval] CI: 1.45–2.23)} and more prone to injury of the wrist (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.933 [95% CI: 1.20–3.12]), hip (aOR: 3.445 [95% CI: 2.07–5.728]), or lower back (aOR: 1.55 [95% CI: 1.18–2.04]). Non-Commissioned Members were more likely to injure the neck (aOR: 2.14 [95% CI: 1.18–3.88]) or shoulder (aOR: 2.03 [95% CI: 1.31–3.15]), when compared with Officers. Parous female participants reported pelvis/abdomen injury at a higher rate than the nulliparous group (5 vs. 1.7%, p 5 0.019). Injuries sustained during an annual CAF fitness assessment differ based on sex, rank, and parity. Canadian Armed Forces female participants, NCM, and parous female participants may require specific physical fitness support in preparation for the annual physical fitness test. © 2023 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",physical employment standard; pregnancy; sex disparities; tactical athlete; women’s health,Canada; Exercise; Female; Humans; Male; Military Personnel; Physical Fitness; Canada; epidemiology; exercise; female; fitness; human; male; military personnel,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Gender Differences in Musculoskeletal Health & Physical Fitness

Methods: In this single-center, randomized controlled trial involving 40 patients with advanced knee osteoarthritis (Kellgren–Lawrence grades III and IV), ACS or saline placebo was injected after 40 mg triamcinolone acetonide (TA) intra-articular injection. Numerical rating scale (NRS) pain scores and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) assessments were conducted at baseline and at weeks 3, 6, 12, and 24. The primary endpoint was the change in KOOS Pain at 24 weeks. Patient safety events were also monitored. Results: At week 24, TA + ACS significantly improved KOOS Pain, Symptoms, Activities of Daily Living, Quality of Life, and KOOS Sport scores. TA + ACS also outperformed TA + placebo in NRS pain scores (average and maximum intensity) at week 24 and NRS pain score (at rest) at weeks 12 and 24.

Materials and methods: Ninety patients with Erb-Duchenne palsy secondary to OBPI participated in a 3-month study, in 2 groups; study group (n = 50) and control group (n = 40). Both followed the same physical therapy program, while the study group also received Kinesio® taping over the scapula and forearm. The patients were evaluated, pre- and post-treatment, using the Modified Mallet Classification (MMC), Active Movement Scale (AMS), and active range of motion (ROM) of the plegic side. Results: There were no statistically significant intergroup differences in age, gender, birth weight or plegic side (p > 0.05), or in pre-treatment MMC and AMS scores (p > 0.05). There were significant differences in favor of the study group for Mallet 2 (external rotation) (p = 0.012), Mallet 3 (hand on the back of the neck) (p < 0.001), Mallet 4 (hand on the back) (p = 0.001) and total Mallet score (p = 0.025), and for AMS shoulder flexion (p = 0.004) and elbow flexion (p < 0.001). ROM results before and after treatment (within groups) showed significant improvement in both groups (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Since this a was a preliminary study, the results should be interpreted with caution in terms of clinical efficacy. The results suggest that associating Kinesio® taping to conventional treatment helps functional development in patients with OBPI.’ © 2023 SFCM",Erb-Duchenne palsy; Kinesio® taping; Obstetric brachial plexus injury; Upper extremity rehabilitation,Brachial Plexus; Brachial Plexus Neuropathies; Female; Humans; Physical Examination; Pregnancy; Shoulder; Treatment Outcome; Active Movement Scale; Article; child; controlled study; elbow flexion; female; forearm; human; kinesio taping; major clinical study; male; Modified Mallet Classification; motor dysfunction assessment; muscle training; obstetrical brachial plexus palsy; physiotherapy; preschool child; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; range of motion; scapula; single blind procedure; stretching exercise; therapy effect; brachial plexus; brachial plexus neuropathy; physical examination; pregnancy; shoulder; treatment outcome,"""Advancements and Efficacy of Therapies in Orthopedics and Sports Medicine""",Clinical Analysis and Trials in Therapy Treatments,Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation in Osteoarthritis Patients

Methods: A consecutive series of 272 shoulders in 256 patients who underwent arthroscopic, double row, TOE repair for full-thickness tears of the supraspinatus tendon were reviewed. Eighty-four shoulders were repaired using knotted suture bridge (KSB) technique, and 188 shoulders were repaired using all knotless suture tape bridge (KTB) technique. Revision procedures and concomitant subscapularis tendon repairs were excluded from analysis. The minimum follow-up was 12 months. Primary outcome was failure of surgical repair, defined as either confirmed retear on MRI and/or need for revision surgery. Secondary clinical outcome measures were assessed including range of motion, strength, visual analog scale (VAS), operative time, subjective shoulder value (SSV), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) mental and physical health, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Shoulder Score (ASES), Brophy shoulder activity scores, and need for manipulation under anesthesia (MUA). Results: A total of 127 shoulders (38 KSB and 89 KTB) met inclusion criteria for the study. No significant difference in demographic variables were present between the groups at baseline. Supraspinatus tear size and average follow-up time did not differ significantly between groups. Failure rates were similar between the KSB and KTB repairs (13.1 vs 7.9%, n.s.). There was no significant difference in functional outcomes including strength, range of motion in forward flexion and external rotation, as well as patient reported outcomes including VAS, SSV, PROMIS, ASES, and Brophy scores between the groups. There was also no difference in post-operative stiffness requiring MUA. Conclusion: Both KSB and KTB repair techniques demonstrate low retear rates with excellent functional outcomes when compared to pre-operative examination. Both KSB and KTB techniques are viable options for achieving a successful rotator cuff repair.

The aim of this study was to compare isokinetic knee strength and functional outcomes between patients with and without AKP following an ACLR using HT graft during the first-year post-surgery. Three hundred and thirty subjects operated by ACLR using hamstring tendon graft were included in our retrospective cohort and divided into two groups: a group with AKP (AKP+ group) and one without AKP (AKP–group). In our population, 14.8% of the patients had AKP. At 4 postoperative months, subjects with pain had lower isokinetic strength limb symmetry index (LSI) for knee flexors and extensors, and a lower Lysholm score than subjects without pain (p < 0.0001). These differences did not persist at 7 post-operative months, and there was no difference in the one-leg hop test. After multivariate analysis, we highlighted the impact of time on the evolution of these parameters. Yet, the exact definition of AKP after ACLR remains to be clearly defined since an imprecise diagnosis may lead to inappropriate management. Pre-operative information about this type of complication, which evolves favourably with time, could be useful for patients. Indeed, AKP can occur after ACLR, even if a HT graft has been used, compared to other surgical procedures using the knee extensor apparatus as patellar tendon graft (AKP is associated with the donor site morbidity). In case of AKP after ACLR, monitoring the muscle inhibition by isokinetic tests may enable clinicians to adapt the retraining and the return to sport. Copyright: © 2023 Chantrelle et al.

Despite its uptake, recent research has illustrated that understandings of PL reflect the normative standards of those who do not experience disability, leading to practices that diminish the unique and embodied capability of others while simultaneously validating ableism. While a shift towards recognizing and valuing the heterogeneity associated with PL has recently occurred, the ableist narrative persists. As a result, the operationalization of PL directly contradicts its conceptualization, fostering a physical activity climate that continues to marginalize individuals experiencing disability. With this in mind, this paper critically unpacks PL, challenging the existing ableist narrative and offering suggestions to heighten the level of inclusivity that underscores PL. Pathways, where physical activity professionals contribute to reproducing ableism, will be discussed. 2023 Pushkarenko, Howse and Gosse.",ableism; critical analysis; disability; inclusion; physical literacy; practical recommendations,,"""Physical Activity Interventions and Motor Competence in Children with Disabilities""",Motor Skills Development and Intervention in Children with Disabilities,Participation and Barriers in Sports and Physical Activities for Individuals with Disabilities

An increase in food intake during emotional and psychological conditions may have a negative impact on human health. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to determine the associations between food consumption, emotional eating behavior, and emotional conditions such as stress, depression, loneliness, boredom eating, maintaining vigilance and alertness, and emotional food consolation. We used a Motivations for Food Choices Questionnaire (Eating Motivations, EATMOT) to determine the emotional aspects of food consumption in 9052 respondents living in 12 European countries between October 2017 and March 2018. Ordinal linear regression was used to identify the associations between the emotional eating behavior and emotional conditions such as stress, depression, loneliness, emotional consolation, and reasons to improve physical and psychological conditions. The regression models confirmed the associations between food consumption, emotional conditions, and emotional eating behavior. Associations were found between the emotional eating behavior and stress (odds ratio (OR) = 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.07–1.60, p = 0.010), depressive mood (OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.40–1.43, p < 0.001), loneliness (OR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.58–1.62, p < 0.001), boredom (OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.36–1.39, p < 0.001), and emotional consolation (OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.54–1.57, p < 0.001). Emotional eating was associated with an effort to improve physical and psychological conditions, such as controlling body weight (OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.10–1.12, p < 0.001), keeping awake and alert (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.19–1.20, p < 0.001) and consumption to feel good (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.21–1.22, p < 0.001). In conclusion, emotions might provoke emotional eating behavior. The appropriate way to handle stress, depression, or other emotional states is important in conditions of being emotionally overwhelmed. The public should be educated on how to handle different emotional states. The focus should be moved somehow from emotional eating and the consumption of unhealthy food to healthy lifestyle practices, including regular exercise and healthy eating habits. Thus, it is necessary to halt these negative health effects on human health through public health programs. © 2023 by the authors.",emotional eating behavior; emotional motivation; lifestyle; motivation for health behavior; negative emotions; stress-related eating,,"""Physical Activity and Health Outcomes in Aging Populations""",Physical Activity and Health in Older Adults,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Methods: On 31 healthy adults, the individual anatomy of the vastus medialis (VM), rectus femoris (RF) and vastus lateralis (VL) was determined using ultrasound. Thereafter, a 3 Hz neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) MP-search with a MP-pen was performed. The thigh anatomy was normalized and divided into 112 (8x14) 3x3cm areas, and the probability of finding a MP in the different areas was calculated to create a MP heat-map. Results: The heat-map displayed the two best 3x3cm areas, over VL and VM respectively, each with a probability greater than 50% of finding a MP and a higher probability compared to all other areas (p <.05). RF exhibited two areas with a 29% probability of finding a MP. A higher number of MPs on the quadriceps, mean (±SD) 9.4 ± 1, was in regression analysis found to be significantly associated with two independent factors higher physical activity level and lower body fat (R2 = 0.42, p=<.0001). Conclusion: Large inter-individual variations in location, and number of MPs were found, but the heat-map displayed areas with higher probability of finding a MP and can be used to facilitate NMES-application. © 2023 The Author(s)",,"Adult; Electric Stimulation; Electromyography; Humans; Lower Extremity; Muscle, Skeletal; Quadriceps Muscle; Thigh; adult; article; body fat; clinical article; controlled study; female; heat; human; human experiment; male; neuromuscular electrical stimulation; physical activity; probability; quadriceps femoris muscle; rectus femoris muscle; ultrasound; vastus lateralis muscle; vastus medialis muscle; electromyography; electrostimulation; lower limb; physiology; skeletal muscle; thigh","""Lower Extremity Health and Biomechanics: Studies on Pain, Function, and Treatment Methods""",Lower Limb Biomechanics and Pain Management in Chronic Conditions,Spinal Cord Injury and Exercise Rehabilitation

The purpose is to compare the impact of the ankle joint on the knee during landing between athletes with chronic instability and a control group (coper group) and to verify the effects of the kinetic chain from other joints. Design: Prospective study. Setting: High school basketball. Participants: Participants were 62 female high school basketball players who had participated in team sports for >6 months. Main outcome measures: Player joint angles, movements, and moments. Results: The knee valgus moment was significantly higher in the chronic ankle instability group than in the coper group (20%–60% [p < 0.01]; 80%–100% [p < 0.05]) during landing motion. The knee valgus moment was also significantly higher during the change from the maximum knee joint flexion position to the maximum extension (p < 0.05). In addition, the landing motions of the chronic instability group may have utilized suboptimal compensatory motor strategy on the sagittal plane, depending heavily on the knee joint's abduction moment. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the chronic ankle instability group uses a different landing strategy pattern than the coper group by changing the joint moment and joint angle during landing, which may increase the risk of anterior cruciate ligament injury. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Ankle sprain; Knee valgus moment; Single-legged landing; Sports injury prevention,abduction; adolescent; ankle instability; ankle joint; anterior cruciate ligament injury; Article; basketball player; controlled study; female; high school; human; joint angle; joint function; kinematics; knee extension angle; knee flexion angle; knee joint; motion; risk factor; sagittal parameter; team sport; valgus knee,"""Sports-Related Injury, Rehabilitation, and Performance Studies""",Rehabilitation and Assessment in Athletes with Chronic Ankle Instability,Effects of different training methods on athletic performance and injury prevention

Consequently, patients with head and neck cancer increasingly turn to basic oral hygiene to alleviate salivary gland dysfunction, and their adherence can be improved by mobile health (mHealth) education. The primary objective of this study will be to analyse the effects of different doses of PBM therapy (7.5 J/cm 2 vs 3 J/cm 2) plus mHealth education on quality of life (QoL), oral health, salivary secretion and salivary gland ultrasound assessment at postintervention and at the 6-month follow-up in patients with head and neck cancer after radiotherapy compared with those in control group. Methods and analysis A prospective, three-arm, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study will be conducted among patients with head and neck cancer suffering from chronic xerostomia. A total of 20 patients per arm will be included and randomly assigned to receive 7.5 J/cm 2 of PBM, 3 J/cm 2 of PBM or placebo therapy. PBM therapy will be applied during 24 sessions at 22 points extra and intraorally two times per week for 3 months, combined with a mobile application (https://www.laxer.es). The assessments will be recorded at the beginning of the study, at postintervention and at the 6-month follow-up. The primary outcomes will be QoL, oral health, salivary secretion and salivary gland ultrasound. The pain pressure threshold, functional performance, mood and sleep quality will be secondary indicators.

Although promoting social participation may extend the walking time of older adults, the longitudinal relationship is not well understood. Thus, this study elucidates the relationship between nine types of social participation and change in walking time during a 3-year follow-up of older adults. Methods: We conducted a 3-year community-based longitudinal study of independent older adults in Japan. From the 2016 and 2019 surveys, we extracted 57,042 individuals. We performed multiple regression analyses, estimating associations between change in walking time after three years and nine types of social participation in 2016: volunteer, sports, hobby, senior, neighborhood, learning, health, skills, and paid work. We conducted subgroup analysis stratified by walking time in 2016 (i.e., < 60 or ≥ 60 min/day). Results: The mean (standard deviation) change in walking time for 3 years was − 4.04 (29.4) min/day. After adjusting potential confounders, the significant predictors of increasing or maintaining walking time (min/day) were participation in paid work (+ 3.02) in the < 60 min/day subgroup; and volunteer (+ 2.15), sports (+ 2.89), hobby (+ 1.71), senior (+ 1.27), neighborhood (+ 1.70), learning (+ 1.65), health (+ 1.74), and skills (+ 1.95) in the ≥ 60 min/day subgroup compared with non-participants. Conclusions: Paid work and community activities may be effective for maintaining or increasing walking time among older adults with less (< 60 min/day) and sufficient (≥ 60 min/day) walking time, respectively. © 2022, The Author(s).",Healthy aging; Hobby; Japan; Paid work; Physical activity; Social capital; Social network; Sports; Volunteering,Aged; Exercise; Humans; Japan; Longitudinal Studies; Social Participation; Surveys and Questionnaires; Walking; aged; epidemiology; exercise; human; Japan; longitudinal study; questionnaire; social participation; walking,"""Physical Activity and Health Outcomes in Aging Populations""",Physical Activity and Health in Older Adults,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

The aim of this research is to examine the effects of the relative age effect of the successful paralympic athletes. The model of the research was determined as ""Basic Qualitative Research"" and the data collection technique in the research was determined as ""Document Analysis"". The analysis of the data in the research was made according to the Miles and Huberman model. The universe of the research consisted of athletes who participated in the Paralympic Games between 1960 and 2022. The sample of the study consisted of 30 elite athletes, including the athletes who won the most gold medals in the Paralympic Games. The sampling method of the research is density sampling based on heuristic approach. As a result, it was understood that for the successful Paralympic athletes, the number of athletes born in the first six months of the election year is higher than those born in the last six months. Thus, it has been concluded that the elite Paralympic athletes with medals in the Paralympic Games are affected by the relative age effect. © The Author(s) 2023.",Athlete; National; Olympic; Paralympic; Relative Age Effect,,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

There is evidence to suggest that the different injury rates are, in part, due to sex-specific differences in running biomechanics, including lower-extremity joint kinematics and kinetics, which are not fully understood, particularly when running with external load. To address this knowledge gap, we collected computed tomography images and motion-capture data from 41 young, healthy adults (20 women and 21 men) running on an instrumented treadmill at 3.0 m/s with loads of 0.0 kg, 11.3 kg, or 22.7 kg. Using individualized computational models, we quantified the running biomechanics and estimated tibial SF risk over 10 weeks of BCT, for each load condition. Across all load conditions, compared to men, women had a significantly smaller flexion angle at the trunk (16.9%–24.6%) but larger flexion angles at the ankle (14.0%–14.7%). Under load-carriage conditions, women had a larger flexion angle at the hip (17.7%–23.5%). In addition, women had a significantly smaller hip extension moment (11.8%–20.0%) and ankle plantarflexion moment (10.2%–14.3%), but larger joint reaction forces (JRFs) at the hip (16.1%–22.0%), knee (9.1%–14.2%), and ankle (8.2%–12.9%). Consequently, we found that women had a greater increase in tibial strain and SF risk than men as load increases, indicating higher susceptibility to injuries. When load carriage increased from 0.0 kg to 22.7 kg, SF risk increased by about 250% in women but only 133% in men. These results provide quantitative evidence to support the Army’s new training and testing doctrine, as it shifts to a more personalized approach that shall account for sex and individual differences.

Researchers interviewed 10 former NFL players about concussion and injury communication that is league-based, team-based, and teammate-based. The researchers performed a thematic analysis of those interview transcripts with a focus on source credibility and injury communication, finding that while the NFL has attempted to make the game safer, players still struggle to trust the league, which impacts their willingness to accept health information. These findings indicate that NFL players may never find the league truly credible or neutral toward injuries.

Methods: A 12-week pre-post intervention study was performed, starting with a 1-week control period. Physical activity and sleep behaviour were continuously measured with a Fitbit charge 3. Self-reported nutritional intake, body mass and waist circumference were collected. Pre-post outcomes were compared with a paired-sample t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Fitbit data were analysed with a mixed model or a panel linear model. Effect sizes were determined and significance was accepted at p <.05. Results: Thirty participants completed the study. No significant changes in physical activity (+1.5 √steps) and sleep quality (–9.7 sleep minutes; −1.2% sleep efficiency) were found. Significant reduction in energy (–1022 kJ, d = 0.71), protein (–8.3 g, d = 0.61) and fat (–13.1 g, d = 0.87) intake, body mass (–2.2 kg, d = 0.61) and waist circumference (–3.3 cm, d = 0.80) were found. Conclusion: Positive changes were found in nutritional behaviour and body composition, but not in physical activity and sleep quality.

The Couch-to-5k is a beginner runner programme aimed at increasing physical activity. However, this programme lacks an evidence base, and it is unclear who is attracted to the programme; running also has a high rate of musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries. The aims of this study were to identify the characteristics of people taking part and the incidence of MSK injuries as well as exploring the experiences of people who dropped out of a modified 9-week Couch-to-5k programme. A total of 110 runners (average age was 47.1 ± 13.7 years) participated in the study, which involved completion of questionnaires (running experience and footwear information, quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), physical activity level (IPAQ-short form), MSK injury history and knee condition (SNAPPS and KOOS-PS)) at the start, middle and end of the programme and collecting sociodemographic information (age, gender, social economic status, relationship status, education level), as well as body mass index, running experience, footwear information, quality of life, physical activity levels, MSK injuries and knee condition. Fifteen drop-outs were interviewed to explore experiences of the programme. Runners were mainly females (81.8%) with an average age 47.1 years, average body mass index of 28.1 kg.m2, mainly from high socio-economic levels, married and educated to degree level. In total, 64% of the sample had previous running experience and were classified as active. Half the sample self-reported pain/discomfort and 37.2% reported anxiety/depression at the start of the programme via the EQ-5D-5L scale. Self-reported health scores increased (p = 0.047) between baseline (73.1 ± 18.8 out of 100) and at the midpoint (81.2 ± 11.6), but there were no significant differences between any other time points (end point 79.7 ± 17.5, p > 0.05). Twenty-one injuries were reported during the programme (19%). Previous injury increased the risk of new injury (OR 7.56 95% CI from 2.06 to 27.75). Only 27.3% completed the programme. Three themes emerged from interviews; MSK injury, negative emotions linked to non-completion and design of the programme. The Couch-to-5k may not attract diverse inactive populations, but future work with larger sample sizes is needed to substantiate this finding. Dropping out was linked to MSK injury and progressive design, so future programmes should consider including injury prevention advice and more flexible designs. © 2023 by the authors.",Couch-to-5k; exercise; musculoskeletal injury; physical activity; running,Adult; Body Mass Index; Brachytherapy; Depression; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; injury; mental health; muscle; physical activity; quality of life; adolescent; adult; aged; anxiety; Article; body mass; cohort analysis; convenience sample; depression; European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 5 Level questionnaire; experience; fear; female; human; human experiment; incidence; international physical activity questionnaire short form; interview; Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score; knee pain; knowledge; male; musculoskeletal injury; observational study; pain; physical activity; quality of life; questionnaire; risk factor; runner; running; sample size; test retest reliability; United Kingdom; visual analog scale; brachytherapy; epidemiology; middle aged; quality of life; United Kingdom,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Gender Differences in Musculoskeletal Health & Physical Fitness

The aim of the present longitudinal cohort study was to investigate the impact of the discordance in global assessments between patients and physicians on 9-year pain-related outcomes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Method: Sixty-eight consecutive outpatients with rheumatoid arthritis on their first visit to a tertiary center were included. Baseline measurements included demographic data, drugs used, disease activity, and a modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (mHAQ). Discordance in global assessment between patients and physicians at baseline was defined as 10 mm higher in the patient global assessment (PGA) than in the physician global assessment. A 9-year follow-up assessment included pain intensity, the European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 3 Level (EQ-5D-3L) scale, Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Pain Disability Assessment Scale (PDAS), and Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ). Results: The number of patients with discordance was 26 (38%) in 68 patients. Patients with a 10 mm higher PGA than the physician global assessment at baseline measurements had significantly worse pain intensity, PCS score, PSEQ score, and EQ-5D-3L score measurements at the 9-year follow-up than those with concordance. A higher mHAQ score and 10 mm higher PGA at baseline were significantly independently associated with the EQ-5D-3L scale score and pain intensity at the 9-year follow-up. Conclusion: This longitudinal cohort study suggested that discordance in global assessment between patients and physicians modestly predicted worse 9-year pain-related outcomes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is the mainstream treatment for ACL injury, aiming to regain normal anatomical structure and stability of the knee joint and promote the patient's return to sports. Under the guidance of the concept of enhanced recovery after surgery, early weight-bearing rehabilitation (EWB) is an important factor affecting patient function and quality of life. However, there is no consensus on whether EWB rehabilitation can be performed after ACL surgery. This study aims to explore the safety and feasibility of EWB after ACL surgery. The study implemented a gradual EWB rehabilitation program in the experimental group, including weight-shifting training, balance training, and gait training on the affected lower limb, and assessed wound healing and stability of the knee joint. The study found that EWB after ACLR is safe and feasible. EWB rehabilitation not only does not pose a negative effect on the patient's knee pain, swelling, wound healing, and stability, but also helps to improve knee active flexion and quality of life faster and better. The EWB program in this study is simple, safe, and effective, and it provides strong theoretical guidance and practical demonstration for accelerated rehabilitation after ACLR. © 2024 JoVE Journal of Visualized Experiments.",,Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Humans; Knee Joint; Quality of Life; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; human; knee; procedures; quality of life; rehabilitation,"""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction and Outcome Factors

Various physical, medical, psychological, and psychosocial factors may individually or cumulatively impact an older adult’s ability to safely age in place. Physiotherapists should assess not only items traditionally considered within their scope of practice but should select efficient and effective outcome measures to quantify other domains of health. A comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is an evidence-based clinical assessment which identifies medical, psychosocial, and functional limitations of an older person. The CGA is useful to dictate individualized exercise/intervention prescription to address identified areas of increased risk. Purpose and importance to practice: The purpose of this Masterclass is to describe key screening, assessments, and interventions to facilitate SAIP and to provide overviews of currently available programming and care delivery models applicable to physiotherapist practice. There are a wide variety of outcome measures and interventions that vary in depth, validity, and reliability. Measures selected for inclusion in this Masterclass were chosen based upon their clinical utility with respect to time and resource constraints and ease of administration during a comprehensive assessment for SAIP in community-dwelling older adults. Measures recommended for assessing physical function were the Short Physical Performance Battery, the Timed-Up-and-Go, the 30 second chair rise test, and the Four Test Balance Scale. Additionally, measures from the heath domain (e.g., Functional Comorbidity Index) and the environmental domain (e.g., Home FAST) are recommended. Relative to interventions, the Otago Exercise Program, motivational interviewing, home modifications, and leveraging technology are recommended. Partnerships with community-facing organizations facilitate utilization of resources for sustainable SAIP. The Home-based Older Person Upstreaming Prevention Physical Therapy (HOP-UP-PT) program is one approach led by physiotherapists framed in the screening, assessments, and interventions discussed in this Masterclass with strong scientific grounding. Conclusion: Programs integrating both community and healthcare approaches have the strongest evidence for their utility; however, implementation for these preventative approaches are lagging behind the increased need due to the substantial population growth of those over 65 years. © 2022, The Author(s).",Balance; Comprehensive geriatric assessment; Exercise; Falls; Geriatrics; Home modification; Independent living; Prevention; Safety,,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

METHODOLOGY: This prospective cohort study was conducted at the Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Lahore General Hospital, Lahore, from January 2021 to June 2022. Patients undergoing arthroscopic BR with anterior instability of the glenohumeral joint with at least >6 episodes of dislocation/subluxation in the last six months were analysed. Functional outcomes were assessed at one-month, three-month and six month intervals post-surgery using ""Modified University of California Los Angeles (UCLA)"" and ""Simple Shoulder Test (SST)"". RESULTS: Of 25 patients, 24 (96.0%) were male. The mean age was 27.20±4.0 years. The mean duration of symptoms was 9.1±6.2 months. In 16 (64.0%) patients, 2-suture anchors were utilised, while 3-suture anchors were used in the remaining 9 (36.0%) patients. Pre-surgery, the mean UCLA score was 16.4±5.6 and improved to 1-month, 3-month and 6-month as 16.6±5.1, 22.8±6.2 and 28.4±6.6 respectively (p<0.001). Pre-surgery, the mean SST score was 4.7±2.4 which improved to 1-month, 3-month and 6-month as 5.4±2.6, 8.1±3.3 and 11.2±3.1 respectively (p<0.001). All patients (100%) had full range of motion after six months post-surgery.

To our knowledge no reports of using a new arthroscopic anatomical reconstruction with a gracilis autograft to treat an ankle re-injury have been described. Case presentation: A 19-year-old man presented with a right ankle injury resulting in isolated lateral ankle instability. The clinical examination showed significant laxity. The MRI confirmed a grade 3 tear of the lateral ligament complex. Arthroscopic anatomical reconstruction with a gracilis autograft was performed and the patient was able to return to all of his activities. Eighteen months after the primary reconstruction, he had another high-energy injury. Despite rehabilitation, he experienced isolated lateral instability. Arthrography confirmed graft failure. The patient underwent a new anatomical reconstruction with the controlateral gracilis autograft, with no difficulties. At 6 months, he had returned to all of his activities, with no limitations or discomfort. Clinical discussion: Articular hypermobility, hindfoot varus and/or excess weight should be looked for or treated to explain the graft failure. Other therapeutic options are possible for revision surgery such as non-anatomical tenodesis, allografts or artificial ligaments. Conclusion: Arthroscopic anatomical reconstruction of the lateral ligaments of the ankle with a new arthroscopic anatomical reconstruction procedure seems to be feasible. Other studies are needed to define the therapeutic strategy for ligament reconstruction graft failures. © 2023 The Authors",Anatomic lateral reconstruction; Arthroscopy; Lateral ankle instability,adult; ankle arthrography; ankle injury; ankle instability; ankle lateral ligament; ankle surgery; arthroscopic anatomical reconstruction; arthroscopic surgery; Article; asthma; autograft; basketball; calcaneus; case report; clinical article; clinical examination; echography; follow up; general practitioner; gracilis muscle; graft failure; human; ligament surgery; male; medical history; non-smoker; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; rehabilitation care; sport injury; supine position; talus; tenodesis; treatment failure; weight bearing; young adult,"""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction and Outcome Factors

The findings showed that there was a significant overall decrease in PA (−16.2%), including in daily occupation (−11.9%), transportation (−13.5%), leisure-time (−16.4%), and sporting (−27.6%) activities. Age, PA level, UMCs, vaccination profiles/types, disease severity, and treatment played a role in determining PA in individuals’ post-acute SARS-CoV-2 infections. Re-infections did not impact the decline in PA. Unvaccinated individuals experienced a significant decline in PA (−13.7%).

METHODS: Twenty middle-aged women were randomly assigned to premenopausal women (PRW; n=11) and postmenopausal women (POW; n=9) groups. All subjects engaged in weight-bearing exercises for 50 minute twice a week for 8 weeks. All participants underwent weight, body mass index (BMI), muscle mass (MM), body fat mass, body fat percentage, waist to hip ratio, bench press (BP), leg press (LP), 3-minute step test (3 MST), sit and reach test (SRT), air squat (AS), push up (PU), curl up (CU), grip strength (GS), and the Korean version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (K-PSQI) measurements before and 4 and 8 weeks after the weight-bearing exercise program. RESULTS: AS and PU improved significantly in the PRW versus POW group (p<.05). BP, LP, 3MST, SRT, AS, PU, CU, GS, and K-PSQI improved significantly in the PRW and POW groups (p<.05). CONCLUSIONS: Weight-bearing exercise improved health-related fitness and sleep indicators in pre-and postmenopausal women. In particular, weight-bearing exercises more effectively improved the muscle endurance of pre-versus postmenopausal women.

Design: Randomized, non-controlled intervention trial. Setting: University laboratory. Participants: Asymptomatic participants (N=50) were recruited for the study and randomized into 5 groups. There were 33 women with an average age of 26.8 (±4.8) years. To participate in the study, individuals had to be between the ages of 18 and 40, free of any musculoskeletal injury which prevented participation of daily activities, and not pregnant or trying to become pregnant. Interventions: Participants were randomly assigned to receive 5 different durations of EDN: 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes. To perform the EDN, 2 monofilament needles were inserted lateral to the lumbar spinous processes of L3 and L5 on the right. Needles were left in situ with electrical stimulation at a frequency of 2 Hz and an amplitude which resulted in a 3 to 6 out of 10 intensity pain rating by the participant. Main Outcome Measures: The change in the magnitude of pain in response to repetitive heat-pulses before and after the EDN procedure. Results: There was a significant reduction in the magnitude of pain in response across the groups after EDN (F(1,42)=94.12, P<.001, ƞp2=.691). However, the interaction between time and group was not significant (F(4,42)=1.019, P=.409, ƞp2=.088), indicating that no duration of EDN was superior to another in reducing temporal summation. Conclusions: This study suggests that in asymptomatic individuals, performing EDN beyond 10 minutes does not provide any additional benefits in the reduction of the magnitude of pain in response to thermal nociceptive stimuli. Additional study in symptomatic populations is required for generalizability in clinical settings. © 2023 The Authors",Electro-dry needling; Physical therapy; Rehabilitation; Temporal summation,adult; age distribution; amplitude modulation; Article; body height; body weight; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; dry needling; electro dry needling; electrostimulation; female; human; human experiment; male; nociceptive stimulation; normal human; pain; paraspinal muscle; physiotherapy; randomized controlled trial; sex difference; thermal stimulation; treatment duration,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Management and Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

Patient preferences should be accounted for as a part of shared decision making. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to perform a discrete choice experiment that evaluated patient preferences toward ACL autografts. We hypothesized that there would be no difference in patient preferences between groups. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Patients aged 18 to 25 years who underwent shoulder arthroscopy at a single institution between 2013 and 2019 were included in the study as a proxy for healthy controls. Patients with a history of ACL tear were excluded. A discrete choice experiment was developed from a literature search and used the following data points as they pertain to BTB or hamstring autograft: risk of developing a significant complication, return-to-play rate, risk of anterior knee pain with kneeling, and risk of additional surgery due to graft failure. Included patients completed a custom survey in which they were asked to choose between “surgery A” (hamstring) and “surgery B” (BTB). Results: A total of 107 participants were included in the analysis. Of these participants, 39 (36.5%) chose surgery A (hamstring) and 68 (63.6%) chose surgery B (BTB). When comparing the hamstring group with the BTB group, there was no significant difference in age, sex, body mass index, race, level of education, or employment status. However, 80.5% of self-reported athletes preferred BTB (P =.008). When controlling for age, sex, and body mass index, patients in the BTB group were more likely to rate return to sport (risk ratio [RR] = 1.49 [95% CI, 1.18-1.98]; P =.001) and the risk of requiring additional surgery due to graft failure (RR = 1.26 [95% CI, 1.02-1.58]; P =.037) as highly important. Conversely, they were less likely than patients in the hamstring group to rate pain while kneeling (RR = 0.65 [95% CI, 0.98-1.05]; P <.001) and complication risk (RR = 0.75 [95% CI, 0.59-0.94]; P =.013) as important. Conclusion: The study hypothesis was rejected, as patient values did affect ACL graft choice preference. Utilizing patient-selected values in a quantifiable way can benefit the shared decision-making process before ACL reconstruction. © The Author(s) 2023.",anterior cruciate ligament; reconstruction; shared decision making,adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; athlete; body mass; bone patellar tendon bone graft; cross-sectional study; Current Procedural Terminology; educational status; employment status; female; hamstring muscle; human; knee pain; major clinical study; male; patient decision making; patient preference; Poisson regression; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial (topic); return to sport; shared decision making; shoulder arthroscopy,"""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction and Outcome Factors

We aim to investigate whether and, if so, how moderate-intensity training (MIT) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) alleviate adverse cardiac remodeling and dysfunction in rats with T2DM. Male rats received standard chow (n = 10) or Western diet (WD) to induce T2DM. Hereafter, WD rats were subjected to a 12-week sedentary lifestyle (n = 8), running MIT (n = 7) or HIIT (n = 7). Insulin resistance and glucose tolerance were assessed during the oral glucose tolerance test. Plasma advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) were evaluated. Echocardiography and hemodynamic measurements evaluated cardiac function. Underlying cardiac mechanisms were investigated by histology, western blot and colorimetry. We found that MIT and HIIT lowered insulin resistance and blood glucose levels compared to sedentary WD rats. MIT decreased harmful plasma AGE levels. In the heart, MIT and HIIT lowered end-diastolic pressure, left ventricular wall thickness and interstitial collagen deposition. Cardiac citrate synthase activity, mitochondrial oxidative capacity marker, raised after both exercise training modalities. We conclude that MIT and HIIT are effective in alleviating diastolic dysfunction and pathological cardiac remodeling in T2DM, by lowering fibrosis and optimizing mitochondrial capacity. © 2023 by the authors.",adverse cardiac remodeling; diastolic dysfunction; exercise training; type 2 diabetes; Western diet,"Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Endurance Training; Heart Diseases; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Male; Rats; Ventricular Remodeling; advanced glycation end product; citrate synthase; collagen; fatty acid; glucose; insulin; protein lysine 6 oxidase; triacylglycerol; tumor necrosis factor; adult; aerobic capacity; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; body weight gain; cholesterol blood level; chow diet; colorimetry; competitive ELISA; controlled study; diabetic heart disease; echocardiography; electrochemiluminescence immunoassay; endurance training; energy expenditure; enzyme activity; glucose blood level; glucose tolerance; heart hemodynamics; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart muscle fibrosis; heart rate; heart ventricle remodeling; heart weight; high intensity interval training; histology; HOMA index; homeostasis model assessment; image analysis; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; left ventricular end-diastolic pressure; left ventricular fractional shortening; left ventricular systolic dysfunction; left ventricular wall thickness; liver weight; male; mitochondrial respiration; moderate intensity exercise; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; oral glucose tolerance test; protein blood level; protein cross linking; protein expression; rat; running; sedentary lifestyle; surface area; total cholesterol level; transthoracic echocardiography; treadmill exercise; triacylglycerol blood level; Western blotting; Western diet; animal; complication; heart disease; heart ventricle remodeling; human; insulin resistance; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus","""Effects of Exercise and Lifestyle Modification on Diabetes, Obesity, and Cardiovascular Health""",Effects of Exercise Programs on Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Health Outcomes,Impact of Exercise and Lifestyle Changes on Health Conditions

Therefore, the present study aims to determine the effect of a multicomponent intervention based on the ecological model on adiposity, physical fitness and motor competence in children aged 4 to 5 years. Methods: This study is a non-randomized controlled trial involving 173 children from Chile. The intervention was based on an ecological model and consisted of a physical activity program with three simultaneous parts, affecting intra- and interpersonal dimensions. The adiposity index, body mass index and waist circumference were measured. For physical fitness, muscle strength in the lower part, speed/agility and cardiorespiratory fitness were measured. Motor competence was assessed using catching, aiming and dynamic and static balance tests. Results: After the intervention, there was no reduction in adiposity indices; in the intervention group, body mass index increased significantly with a high effect size. The intervention group showed significant differences in physical fitness in the components of muscle strength in the lower part (p = 0.000) and speed/agility (p = 0.002). For motor competence, the intervention group showed significant improvements in most components. Conclusions: The multicomponent intervention did not reduce adiposity indices; however, it caused significant improvements in the physical fitness and motor competence components, so it seems prudent to continue implementing it, given the benefits that adequate levels of motor competence and physical fitness bring to children’s health, both in the short and long term. © 2024 by the authors.",cardiorespiratory fitness; gross motor competence; preschool; speed/agility; strength,Article; body mass; cardiorespiratory fitness; child; competence; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; effect size; fitness; follow up; heart rehabilitation; human; human experiment; muscle strength; obesity; physical activity; preschool child; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; sedentary lifestyle; storytelling; systolic blood pressure; velocity; waist circumference,"""Physical Activity, Fitness, and Health Studies in Children and Adolescents""",Physical Activity and Its Effects on Health and Well-being in Children and Adolescents,Physical Fitness in Children and Adolescents

Methods Thirty adults (18-30 yr) completed a bilateral leg extension blood flow restriction bout consisting of four sets (30-15-15-15 repetitions), with cuffs applied at pressures corresponding to 40% and 60% of the minimum arterial occlusion pressure (AOP) needed to completely collapse the femoral arteries. During each of these conditions (40% and 60% AOP), physiological measures of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and EMG amplitude (EMG AMP) were collected from the dominant or nondominant vastus lateralis. After each set, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were collected, whereas only at baseline and at the end of the bout, mean arterial pressure (MAP) was assessed. Separate mixed-factorial ANOVA models were used to examine mean differences in the change in EMG AMP and NIRS parameters during each set. The absolute RPE and MAP values were also examined with separate ANOVAs. A P value ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Regardless of sex or cuff pressure, the change in EMG AMP was lower in set 1 (14.8%) compared with the remaining sets (22.6%-27.0%). The 40% AOP condition elicited the greatest changes in oxy[heme] and deoxy[heme], while also providing lower RPEs. For MAP, there was an effect for time such that MAP increased from preexercise (87.5 ± 4.3 mm Hg) to postexercise (104.5 ± 4.1 mm Hg). Conclusions The major findings suggested that the 40% AOP condition permitted the greatest amount of recovery during the interset rest. In addition, there did not seem to be any meaningful sex-related difference in this sample of young healthy adults. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",BILATERAL EXERCISE; ELECTROMYOGRAPHY; EXERCISE PRESSOR REFLEX; NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; RATINGS OF PERCEIVED EXERTION; SEX DIFFERENCES,"Blood Pressure; Female; Femoral Artery; Heme; Hemodynamics; Humans; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Quadriceps Muscle; Regional Blood Flow; Resistance Training; Young Adult; heme; blood flow; blood pressure; female; femoral artery; hemodynamics; human; male; physiology; procedures; quadriceps femoris muscle; resistance training; skeletal muscle; young adult","""Effects and Applications of Blood Flow Restriction in Exercise Rehabilitation and Performance Enhancement""",Blood Flow Restriction Therapy in Low-Resistance Rehabilitation Exercises,Muscle Strength and Recovery in Sports Performance

Previously identified sociodemographic, psychological, and injury-related factors account for only a small proportion of the variability in emotional distress post-TBI. Genetic factors may help to further understand emotional distress in this population. The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val158 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) 66Met single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified as possible contributory factors to outcomes after TBI. We investigated whether the COMT Val158 and BDNF 66Met SNPs were associated with emotional distress 1 year after moderate-severe TBI, and whether these associations were moderated by age, sex, and TBI severity (as measured by the duration of post-traumatic amnesia [PTA]). Moderate-severe TBI survivors (COMT, n = 391; BDNF, n = 311) provided saliva samples after admission to a TBI rehabilitation hospital. At a follow-up interview *1 year after injury, participants completed a self-report measure of emotional distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; HADS). Multiple linear regression models were constructed for each SNP to predict total scores on the HADS. Neither COMT Val158 nor BDNF 66Met carriage status (carrier vs. non-carrier) significantly predicted emotional distress (COMT, p = 0.49; BDNF, p = 0.66). Interactions of SNP • age (COMT, p = 0.90; BDNF, p = 0.93), SNP • sex (COMT, p = 0.09; BDNF, p = 0.60), SNP • injury severity (COMT, p = 0.53; BDNF, p = 0.87), and SNP • sex • age (COMT, p = 0.08; BDNF, p = 0.76) were also non-significant. Our null findings suggest that COMT Val158 and BDNF 66Met SNPs do not aid the prediction of emotional distress 1 year after moderate-severe TBI, neither in isolation nor in interaction with age, sex and injury severity. The reporting of null findings such as ours is important to avoid publication bias and prompt researchers to consider the challenges of single-gene candidate studies in understanding post-TBI outcomes. Analyses in larger samples that incorporate multiple genetic factors and their relevant moderating factors may provide a greater understanding of the role of genetics in post-TBI emotional distress. © Chloe Anderson et al., 2023; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",age; BDNF Val66Met; COMT Val158Met; emotional distress; genetics; sex; TBI; traumatic brain injury,,"""Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion: Studies on Impacts, Recovery, and Influences""",Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion Studies in Young Athletes,Post-Concussion Symptoms and Recovery in Adolescents

This relationship has not yet been confirmed. Objective: We compared the radiological impingement parameters between complete, isolated SSP tears and bursal-sided SSP tears. The study hypothesis was that the impingement parameters in the bursal-sided SSP tear group would be significantly more pronounced. Materials and methods: In total, 43 patients with bursal-sided SSP tendon partial tear (group 1; n = 43) and 43 patients with complete, isolated SSP tendon tear (group 2; n = 43) were included and matched for age (groups 1 and 2: 58 ± 9 years) and gender (70% male and 30% female patients). Standardized preoperative radiographs (anteroposterior; outlet view) were compared for radiological impingement parameters: critical shoulder angle (CSA), lateral acromial angle (LAA), acromiohumeral index (AHI), acromiohumeral distance (AHD), acromion type according to Bigliani (ATB). Results: Radiological parameters did not differ significantly between groups: CSA: 36° ± 4° (group 1) and 36° ± 4° (group 2); LAA: 79° ± 6° vs. 80° ± 8°; AHD: 11 mm ± 2 mm vs. 10 mm ± 2 mm. The AHI was 0.7 ± 0.1 for both groups. Furthermore, ATB II was most common in both groups (group 1 = 74%; group 2 = 63%), followed by ATB I (group 1 = 14%; group 2 = 23%) and ATB III (group 1 = 12%; group 2 = 14%; p = 0.443). Conclusion: We found no difference in radiological impingement parameters between bursal-sided and complete SSP tears and therefore reject the study hypothesis.

A total of 22 Participants were randomly divided into two experimental groups: combined resistance training (3 sessions per week for 8 weeks) and chocolate milk consumptions (include 30 g protein) Resistance Training Chocolate Milk (RTCM) (Age: 20.9 ± 0.9 years old) and resistance training (RT) only (Age: 19.8 ± 0.7 years old). Muscle thickness (MT), using a portable ultrasound, body composition, body mass, maximal strength (one repetition maximum (1 RM), counter movement jump (CMJ) and peak power (PP) were determined at baseline and 8 weeks later. In the RTCM, finding showed a significant improvement in the outcomes compared to the RT group, besides the main effect of time (pre and post). The 1 RM total increased by 36.7% in RTCM group compared to 17.6% increased in the RT group (p < 0.001). Muscle thickness increased by 20.8% in the RTCM group and 9.1% in the RT group (p < 0.001). In the RTCM group, the PP increased by 37.8% compared to only 13.8% increase in the RT group (p = 0.001). The group*time interaction effect was significant for MT, 1RM, CMJ, and PP (p < 0.05), and it was observed that the RTCM and the 8-week resistance training protocol maximized performance. Body fat percentage (%) decreased more in the RTCM (18.9%) group than in the RT (6.7%) group (p = 0.002). In conclusion, chocolate milk (500 mL) with high protein content consumed in addition to resistance training provided superior gains in terms of MT, 1 RM, body composition, CMJ, and PP. The finding of the study demonstrated the positive effect of casein-based protein (chocolate milk) and resistance training on the muscle performance. Chocolate milk consumption has a more positive effect on muscle strength when combined with RT and should be considered as a suitable post-exercise nutritional supplement. Future research could be conducted with a larger number of participants of different ages and longer study durations.

We hypothesized that using a patellar tendon graft with a press-fit fixation technique without any fixation device reduces the incidence of femoral tunnel widening. Methods: This study was conducted on 467 patients with ACL surgery between 2003 and 2015. Two hundred and nineteen of them had an ACL surgery with patellar tendon (PT) graft, and two hundred and forty-eight of them with hamstring tendon (HS). Exclusion criteria were history of previous ACL reconstruction of either knee, multiple ligament injury, or evidence of osteoarthritis on radiographs. The femoral tunnels were measured on the anteroposterior (ap) and lateral radiographs 6 months after the operation. Two independent orthopedic surgeons measured all radiographs twice and recorded the tunnel widenings. We hypothesized that using an implant-free press-fit technique with PT graft can reduce the femoral tunnel widening incidence rate. Results: The mean incidence rate of the tunnel widening in the HS group was, on the AP and the lateral femoral views, 88% (n = 217) and 83% (n = 205), while in the PT group, 17% (n = 37) and 2% (n = 4), respectively. There was a significant difference both on AP and lateral radiographs (HS vs. PT: fem. AP: 89% vs. 17% p < 0.001; HS vs. PT: fem. lat: 84% vs. 2% p < 0.001). Conclusion: The femoral tunnel widening incidence rate during an ACL reconstruction is significantly less when using PT tendon with femoral press-fit fixation than when using HT tendon with suspensory fixation method. © 2023, The Author(s).",ACL reconstruction; Femoral tunnel widening; Patellar tendon; Press-fit fixation,,"""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction and Outcome Factors

We hypothesized lower middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv) in individuals post-stroke: 1) during 10 minutes of HIIE, 2) immediately following HIIE, and 3) 30 minutes after HIIE, compared to age- and sex-matched controls (CON). We used a recumbent stepper submaximal exercise test to determine workloads for high-intensity and active recovery. Our low volume HIIE protocol consisted of 1-minute intervals for 10 minutes. During HIIE, we measured MCAv, mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and end tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO2). We assessed carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity as a measure of arterial stiffness. Fifty participants completed the study (25 post-stroke, 76% ischemic, 32% moderate disability). Individuals post-stroke had lower MCAv during HIIE compared to CON (p = 0.03), which remained 30 minutes after HIIE. Individuals post-stroke had greater arterial stiffness (p = 0.01) which was moderately associated with a smaller MCAv responsiveness during HIIE (r = −0.44). No differences were found for MAP, HR, and PETCO2. This study suggests individuals post-stroke had a lower MCAv during HIIE compared to their peers, which remained during recovery up to 30 minutes. Arterial stiffness may contribute to the lower cerebrovascular responsiveness post-stroke. © The Author(s) 2023.",Cerebral autoregulation; cerebral blood flow; cerebral hemodynamics; physiotherapy; rehabilitation,,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

The best format of exercise training (ET) in the setting of cardiac rehabilitation in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) is still to be defined. Current guidelines recommend aerobic exercises, such as running and cycling, including some sessions per week of resistance exercise. Aim. The aim of this study was to address the effectiveness of a concurrent exercise training program utilizing a circuit of sequential endurance and resistance exercises on functional capacity and muscular strength in patients with CHF. Methods. Ninety-five consecutive male patients (age 63.1 ± 6 years) with CHF (EF < 40%) in NYHA functional class II/III, were randomly assigned on 1:1 basis to a 12-week aerobic continuous training (AT) or concurrent CT), aerobic + resistance, training (CT), three times a week, with each session lasting 80 min. We used high quality, specifically designed ergometers, connected with each other and governed by a central console, and managed by a single physiotherapist. Before and after training all patients performed a symptoms-limited exercise test on a treadmill and a 6-min walking test (6MWT). Patients in the CT group also performed resistance exercises of upper and lower body. Results. The 6MWT and exercise duration at ergometric test increased significantly in both AT and CT groups, with the increase being greater in CT group (p < 0.001; ES = 0.13; p < 0.01; ES = 0.07). Muscular strength increased significantly in the CT group, particularly in the lower body muscular districts (p < 0.001). Quality of life improved in both groups, with a significantly greater improvement in the CT group (p < 0.05). No side effects leading to discontinuation of training were observed. Conclusions. These findings indicate that concurrent, within-session training results in larger improvements in functional capacity, in addition to muscle performance, in patients with CHF, in comparison to single-mode aerobic training. © 2023 by the authors.",aerobic exercise; chronic heart failure; concurrent training; resistance exercise,aldosterone antagonist; angiotensin receptor antagonist; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; diuretic agent; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; ivabradine; sacubitril plus valsartan; adult; aerobic exercise; Article; comparative effectiveness; continuous training; exercise test; exercise tolerance; functional status; heart failure; heart left ventricle ejection time; hemodynamic parameters; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; muscle function; muscle strength; muscle training; New York Heart Association class; physiotherapist; quality of life; resistance training; six minute walk test; therapy effect; treadmill ergometry; treadmill test,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation and Exercise Training

Platelet-rich fibrin matrix (PRFM) is a promising adjunctive therapy for AT. We analyzed 24-month pain and functional outcomes in a cohort of patients managed by tendon debridement and autologous PRFM application to determine whether the combined treatment ensured an early return to sports/work and satisfactory clinical outcomes and functional scores. (2) Methods: The 24-month outcomes of 32 sport-practicing patients with chronic midportion AT treated with debridement and autologous PRFM were evaluated in terms of time to return to sports/work. The AOFAS and VISA-A were computed preoperatively and at 6 and 24 months. Blazina scores were evaluated preoperatively and at 6 months; ankle range of motion was assessed at 1, 6, 12, 24 months; and patient satisfaction was assessed at 24 months. (3) Results: Altogether, all patients had resumed their sport(s) activity, at the same or higher level, after 25.41 days (±5.37). Regarding work, all patients were able to return to their jobs after 16.41 days (±2.43). Ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion increased significantly: the AOFAS rose from 54.56 (±6.47) to 97.06 (±4.06) and 98.88 (±2.21) at 6 and 12 months, respectively, and the mean VISA-A score rose from 69.16 (±7.35) preoperatively to 95.03 (±4.67) and 97.28 (±2.43) at 6 and 12 months, respectively, after treatment.

However, studies that histologically evaluate the quality of the torn rotator cuff (RC) tendon and its association with postoperative outcomes are limited. Purpose: To investigate factors associated with retear after ARCR using the suture bridge (SB) technique, including the degree of histological degeneration of the RC tendon edge. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: The authors retrospectively evaluated 187 patients who underwent ARCR for full-thickness tears using the SB technique; intraoperative biopsy samples were taken to assess the degree of histological degeneration using the Bonar score. The cohort was divided into healed (n = 165) and retear (n = 22) groups according to magnetic resonance imaging results obtained ≥6 months postoperatively. The evaluation included preoperative patient data (age, sex, symptom duration, trauma history, history of heavy manual work, smoking habit, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia) and radiological data (Hamada classification, Patte classification, Goutallier classification, and global fatty degeneration index [GFDI]). Additionally, intraoperative data (anteroposterior tear size, Lafosse classification for concomitant subscapularis tendon tear, and long head of biceps injury) and preoperative and postoperative clinical findings (active range of motion, University of California, Los Angeles [UCLA], score) were evaluated. Results: The retear rate was 11.8%. The retear group had a higher percentage of men (P =.031), higher Bonar score (P <.001), higher mean GFDI value (P =.002), higher rate of tear retraction degree (P =.010), and larger anteroposterior tear size (P =.020) than the healed group. The retear group had lower postoperative internal rotation (P =.031) and lower UCLA score (P <.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis with a stepwise variable selection revealed anteroposterior tear size (odds ratio [OR], 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.5; P =.004) and Bonar score (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3-2.4; P <.001) as independent predictors for a retear. Conclusion: The results indicate that end-stage severe tendon degeneration might affect retear. Therefore, further investigation on the progression mechanisms of tendon degeneration and development of methods to assess degenerative tissue might improve clinical outcomes after ARCR. © 2023 The Author(s).",arthroscopic rotator cuff repair; Bonar score; histopathology; suture bridge technique,"Arthroscopy; Case-Control Studies; Humans; Lacerations; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Range of Motion, Articular; Retrospective Studies; Rotator Cuff; Rotator Cuff Injuries; Rupture; Sutures; Tendons; Treatment Outcome; arthroscopy; case control study; diagnostic imaging; human; laceration; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; range of motion; retrospective study; rotator cuff; rotator cuff injury; rupture; tendon; treatment outcome","""Shoulder Joint Health and Rehabilitation: Arthroscopic Surgeries, Treatments and Outcomes""",Clinical Outcomes and Treatments in Shoulder Care,Shoulder Surgery Outcomes and Measures

It is characterized as being overly involved, protective, and low on granting autonomy, and is associated with deleterious psychosocial outcomes outside of the concussion literature. This study examined the association of overparenting and patient emotional distress and clinical outcomes (i.e., symptoms, neurocognitive test scores, recovery time) post-concussion. Adolescents/young adult concussion patients (injury < 30 days) and parents (N = 101 child-parent dyads) participated. Patient participants completed measures of depression, anxiety, stress, and concussion clinical outcomes while parents concurrently completed an overparenting measure. Results of a general linear model found that overparenting was associated with higher anxiety and stress report of the child. Overparenting had a significant positive correlation with concussion recovery, although of a small magnitude. Emotional distress level, but not overparenting, was moderately associated with worse performance on clinical outcomes, including neurocognitive testing, vestibular/ocular motor dysfunction, and concussion symptom severity. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Clinical outcomes; Concussion recovery; Emotional distress; Helicopter parenting; Overparenting,Adolescent; Anxiety; Athletic Injuries; Brain Concussion; Emotions; Humans; Neuropsychological Tests; Parenting; Young Adult; adolescent; anxiety; brain concussion; child parent relation; complication; emotion; human; neuropsychological test; sport injury; young adult,"""Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion: Studies on Impacts, Recovery, and Influences""",Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion Studies in Young Athletes,Post-Concussion Symptoms and Recovery in Adolescents

Therefore, a secondary analysis was performed herein on a muscle transcriptomic dataset we previously published involving trained college-aged men (n = 11) performing two resistance exercise bouts in a randomized and crossover fashion. The lower-load bout (30 Fail) consisted of 8 sets of lower body exercises to volitional fatigue using 30% one-repetition maximum (1 RM) loads, whereas the higher-load bout (80 Fail) consisted of the same exercises using 80% 1 RM loads. Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were collected prior to (PRE), 3 h, and 6 h after each exercise bout, and 58 genes associated with skeletal muscle hypertrophy were manually interrogated from our prior microarray data. Select targets were further interrogated for associated protein expression and phosphorylation induced-signaling events. Although none of the 58 gene targets demonstrated significant bout x time interactions, ~57% (32 genes) showed a significant main effect of time from PRE to 3 h (15↑ and 17↓, p < 0.01), and ~26% (17 genes) showed a significant main effect of time from PRE to 6 h (8↑ and 9↓, p < 0.01). Notably, genes associated with the myostatin (9 genes) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) (9 genes) signaling pathways were most represented. Compared to mTORC1 signaling mRNAs, more MSTN signaling-related mRNAs (7 of 9) were altered post-exercise, regardless of the bout, and RHEB was the only mTORC1-associated mRNA that was upregulated following exercise. Phosphorylated (phospho-) p70S6K (Thr389) (p = 0.001; PRE to 3 h) and follistatin protein levels (p = 0.021; PRE to 6 h) increased post-exercise, regardless of the bout, whereas phospho-AKT (Thr389), phospho-mTOR (Ser2448), and myostatin protein levels remained unaltered. These data continue to suggest that performing resistance exercise to volitional fatigue, regardless of load selection, elicits similar transient mRNA and signaling responses in skeletal muscle. Moreover, these data provide further evidence that the transcriptional regulation of myostatin signaling is an involved mechanism in response to resistance exercise. © 2023 by the authors.",acute resistance exercise; gene expression; mRNA; protein,"Gene Expression; Humans; Hypertrophy; Male; Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1; Muscle, Skeletal; Myostatin; Resistance Training; RNA, Messenger; Young Adult; albendazole; autophagy; follistatin; gelatinase B; mammalian target of rapamycin; mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1; messenger RNA; muscle protein; myostatin; polyvinylidene fluoride; protein p53; sirolimus; transcriptome; unclassified drug; mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1; myostatin; aged; apoptosis; Article; bioinformatics; body mass; clinical article; controlled study; diet supplementation; DNA isolation; DNA methylation; DNA microarray; electroporation; endurance training; exercise; fatigue; gene expression; gene mutation; gene therapy; genetic marker; genetic transcription; human; hypertrophy; male; MAPK signaling; microarray analysis; muscle biopsy; muscle growth; muscle hypertrophy; muscle mass; prefrontal cortex; protein phosphorylation; regulatory T lymphocyte; resistance training; secondary analysis; signal transduction; skeletal muscle; transcription initiation; upregulation; vastus lateralis muscle; Western blotting; gene expression; genetics; metabolism; skeletal muscle; young adult","""Effects of Different Factors on Muscle Performance and Metabolism""",Exercise and Muscle Performance in Different Individuals,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

The aim of this study was to investigate functional and psychological outcomes in patients who underwent arthroscopic capsular release for a frozen shoulder. Methods: A retrospective study with prospective data collection was conducted with 78 patients suffering from frozen shoulder resistance to conservative treatment. Considering the etiology, there were 36 (46.2%) idiopathic, 31 (39.7%) postoperative, and 11 (14.1%) posttraumatic cases. Preoperatively, each patient was evaluated with the range of motion (ROM) assessment and the Constant-Murley score (CMS). At follow-up, the 4-point subjective satisfaction scale (SSS), the ROM assessment, the SF-12 questionnaire, the numerical rating scale (NRS) for the subjective assessment of pain, the CMS and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were assessed. Results: After a mean follow-up of 54.2 ± 22.3 months, ROM and CMS showed a statistically significant improvement between pre- and postoperative values (all p < 0.001). Before surgery, the mean CMS was 36.9% that of sex- and age-matched healthy individuals, and all patients showed a CMS lower than the normative data. At the final follow-up visit, the mean CMS was 99.9% that of sex- and age-matched healthy individuals, and 49 (62.8%) patients showed a CMS equal to or higher than the normative data. The mean increase in the CMS was 56.1 ± 8.3 points. The mean SSS, HADS-A, HADS-D, and NRS were 3.7 ± 0.5, 2.5 ± 1.6, 2.2 ± 1.3, and 2.2 ± 1.0, respectively. All patients returned to their previous level of work and sports activity after 2 and 2.5 months, respectively. The multivariate analysis showed the association between a higher postoperative CMS and the idiopathic etiology of a frozen shoulder (p = 0.004, β = 3.971). No intraoperative complications occurred. Postoperatively, four patients (5.1%) were treated with intra-articular steroid injections to manage residual symptoms. One patient (1.3%) with a postoperative frozen shoulder showed persistent symptoms and underwent a new successful arthroscopic capsular release. Conclusion: High patient satisfaction and statistically significant ROM and CMS recovery can be achieved after arthroscopic capsular release to manage frozen shoulder. Better functional outcomes are expected when the etiology is idiopathic. Results can help surgeons identify the patients who will most benefit from surgery and should be discussed with the patient.

More studies have focused on these problems and were conducted with hospitalized patients and/or adult and geriatric populations. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of mild COVID-19 on fatigue, muscle strength, balance, and exercise performance, specifically in young adults. Methods: This research was designed as a case-control study, and tests were conducted between January 2022 and June 2022. The study included 60 participants aged 18-28, consisting of individuals who had a mild COVID-19 diagnosis within the past year (study group, n=30) and tested negative during the study, as well as a control group of individuals who had no COVID-19 diagnosis or symptoms within the past year (control group, n=30). The participants’ fatigue levels (Chalder Fatigue Scale), lower (Biodex Isokinetic-Dynamometer) and upper (Jamar-Handgrip Dynamometer) extremity muscle strength, balance (Y-Balance Test), and exercise performance (Queen’s College Step Test) were evaluated using various standardized tests. Results: Measurements showed that individuals with COVID-19 had an increase in fatigue scores (p=0.02). It was determined that fatigue was particularly prominent in women. Due to this difference that arose according to gender, it was observed that fatigue scores in those who had experienced COVID-19 were negatively correlated with muscle strength measurements. Conclusion: This study showed that symptoms of fatigue persisted in younger individuals, especially women, even after the COVID-19 infection. We think the next research should focus on COVID-19 symptoms, surveillance, and therapy in different age groups. © 2023 by the Istanbul Haseki Training and Research Hospital The Medical Bulletin of Haseki published by Galenos Publishing House.",COVID-19; dyspnea; fatigue; muscle weakness,adult; Article; body equilibrium; body height; body weight; case control study; Chalder Fatigue Scale; cigarette smoking; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; dyspnea; exercise; exercise test; fatigue; female; grip strength; hand grip; heart rate; human; knee function; male; maximal oxygen uptake; medical procedures; muscle strength; muscle weakness; physical performance; Queen College Step Test; Y Balance Test,"""Impacts of COVID-19 on Physical and Mental Health, Exercise Habits, and Rehabilitation Strategies""","Impact of COVID-19 on Health, Physical Activity and Quality of Life",Post-COVID-19 Syndrome and Rehabilitation Strategies

However, possible moderating variables of these relationships have also been identified, such as age, gender, level of physical activity, and the scope of physical activity. This study aimed to analyze the relationships between physical activity and mental health levels in undergraduate students, assessing whether these associations can change depending on the level of physical activity (low, medium, or high) and the setting (occupational, commuting, or leisure time physical activity) in which it was performed. A descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted. The sample comprised 847 undergraduate students. Physical activity and mental health were measured by the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQv2) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). We found relationships between students’ physical activity level and their mental health status. The higher the total physical activity, the better their mental health scores. High levels of commuting and leisure time physical activity is also associated with better mental health, while only moderate levels of occupational physical activity are associated with better mental health status. Regarding the possible associations between physical activity and vulnerability to mental health problems, with the fully adjusted regression model, leisure time and occupational physical activity remain protective of a poor state of mental health. Leisure time physical activity, performed at a high level, and moderate occupational physical activity seems to be the best combination of physical activity to reduce students’ vulnerability to potential mental health problems. © 2022 by the authors.",exercise; mental health; physical activity; sports; undergraduate students,Cross-Sectional Studies; Exercise; Humans; Leisure Activities; Mental Health; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; health status; mental health; physical activity; sport; student; vulnerability; adolescent; adult; Article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; distress syndrome; female; human; leisure; major clinical study; male; mental disease; mental health; physical activity; questionnaire; sociodemographics; undergraduate student; young adult; exercise; psychology; student,"""Physical Activity, Fitness, and Health Studies in Children and Adolescents""",Physical Activity and Its Effects on Health and Well-being in Children and Adolescents,Mental Health and Physical Activity in Times of COVID-19

Its effect on bones that heal by intramembranous ossification has not been sufficiently investigated. In this study, we examined LIPUS and the autologous bone, to determine their effect on the healing of the critical-size bone defect (CSBD) of the rat calvaria. The bone samples underwent histological, histomorphometric and immunohistochemical analyses. Both LIPUS and autologous bone promoted osteogenesis, leading to almost complete closure of the bone defect. On day 30, the bone volume was the highest in the autologous bone group (20.35%), followed by the LIPUS group (19.12%), and the lowest value was in the control group (5.11%). The autologous bone group exhibited the highest intensities of COX-2 (167.7 ± 1.1) and Osx (177.1 ± 0.9) expression on day 30. In the LIPUS group, the highest intensity of COX-2 expression was found on day 7 (169.7 ±1.6) and day 15 (92.7 ± 2.2), while the highest Osx expression was on day 7 (131.9 ± 0.9).

Participants performed an exercise test twice at similar levels of intensity before and after a series of ten WBC sessions. Before and during the test, each participant’s oxygen uptake (VO2), heart rate (HR), internal temperature (Ti), and skin temperature in selected areas of the skin were measured, and the mean arterial pressure (MAP), physiological strain index (PSI), and mean skin temperature (Tsk) were calculated. The results show that during exercise, increases in Ti and the PSI were significantly lower after the WBC sessions, and although there were no significant changes in HR or the MAP, the Tsk was significantly higher. Following exercise, an increase in skin temperature asymmetry over the lower-body muscles was detected. A series of WBC sessions induced a tendency toward a decrease in temperature asymmetry over the thigh muscles. In conclusion, a series of ten WBC sessions does not induce significant modifications in physiological variables but does influence the PSI and Ti during exercise. Moreover, a series of ten WBC sessions influences the distribution of skin temperature and the magnitude of temperature asymmetries in the early phase of recovery. © 2023 by the authors.",athletes; exercise; skin temperature; whole-body cryostimulation,adult; article; athlete; controlled study; elite athlete; exercise; exercise test; female; heart rate; human; human experiment; male; mean arterial pressure; skin temperature; thigh muscle,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

However, the association is still unknown. Objective: The study aimed to determine the association among pain, SBF and temperature, PF and FDB thickness, and foot function index in individuals with plantar fasciitis. Methods: Thirty-two individuals with unilateral plantar fasciitis were interviewed for demographic data and assessed for pain at the first step in the morning (Painm), pain at rest (Painr), and pain at 80 N/cm2 pressure (Pain80) by visual analog scale (VAS), SBF, and skin temperature (ST) by laser dropper flowmetry (LDF), PF and FDB thickness by ultrasound imaging (USI), and foot function by foot functional index (FFI). The association was analyzed by the Spearman correlation coefficient. Results: A significant correlation was found among Painm and Painr, Pain80, SBF, PF, and FFI. Painr was correlated with SBF, and FFI. Pain80 was also correlated with FFI. SBF was correlated with ST and FFI. Conclusions: The association among pain, PF thickness, and FFI was reported in individuals with plantar fasciitis, which can be meaningful relationship between clinical outcomes and ultrasonographic evidence.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Heel pain; Outcomes; Physical therapy; Relationship; Ultrasonography,,"""Lower Extremity Health and Biomechanics: Studies on Pain, Function, and Treatment Methods""",Lower Limb Biomechanics and Pain Management in Chronic Conditions,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

The objective of this cross-sectional study was to further explore the body composition and nutritional status of adolescents with overweight or obesity using usual and unusual indicators. Participants were 90 adolescents between 10 and 18 years of age belonging to a multiprofessional obesity treatment program, who were evaluated with multifrequency bioelectrical impedance to determine their nutritional status as overweight, with obesity or with severe obesity and body composition. Analysis of variance, correlation, and linear regression adjusted for confounding variables were used to analyze the data. There were significant differences between the three groups according to their BMI in lean and fat mass as the usual indicators (p<0.05). The same was observed for lean and fat mass indexes, and for lean-to-fat ratio (p<0.01) which are unusual indicators. Additionally, positive and significant correlations were observed between usual and unusual variables (r = 0.5 to 0.89; p<0.05). At the same time, lean and fat mass mainly tended to increase with a higher BMI in adolescents (p<0.05). It is concluded that the comparison and associations between the usual and unusual variables provided important findings on the evaluation of adolescents with overweight, obesity, or severe obesity. It should be considered that this study was cross-sectional and did not indicate cause-effect between the variables. © Copyright: Federación Española de Asociaciones de Docentes de Educación Física (FEADEF).",Body composition; cardiometabolic risk; Evaluation; nutritional condition; young teenagers,,"""Effects of Exercise and Lifestyle Modification on Diabetes, Obesity, and Cardiovascular Health""",Effects of Exercise Programs on Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Health Outcomes,Physical Fitness in Children and Adolescents

Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare trunk control between people with AD and healthy older adults, and investigate the relationship between trunk control and balance, gait, functional mobility, and fear of falling in people with AD. Methods: The study was completed with 35 people with AD and 33 healthy older adults with matching age and gender. Trunk control was evaluated with Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS); balance with Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Functional Reach Test (FRT), One-Leg Standing Test (OLST) and Five-Repeat Sit-and-Stand Test (5STS); gait with Dynamic Gait Index (DGI); functional mobility with Timed Up and Go (TUG) Test; fear of falling with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I). Results: BBS, FRT, OLST, and DGI scores were lower and 5STS and TUG Test scores were higher in people with AD compared to healthy older adults (p < 0.05). There was no difference in FES-I score between people with AD and healthy older adults (p > 0.05). TIS was associated with BBS, FRT, OLST, 5STS, DGI, TUG Test, and FES-I (r between − 0.341 and 0.738; p < 0.05 for all). Conclusion: Trunk control is affected and related with balance, gait, functional mobility, and fear of falling in people with AD. For this reason, we think that trunk control should be evaluated in the early period, and applications for trunk control should be included in rehabilitation approaches in order to improve balance, gait, functional mobility, and reduce fear of falling. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland.",Balance; Fear of falling; Functional mobility gait; Trunk control,Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Fear; Gait; Humans; Physical Therapy Modalities; Postural Balance; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; Berg Balance Scale; clinical article; controlled study; Dynamic Gait Index; Falls Efficacy Scale; fear of falling; female; gait; human; male; somatosensory system; timed up and go test; trunk; Trunk Impairment Scale; body equilibrium; fear; gait; physiotherapy,"""Balance, Mobility, and Fall Risks in Aging and Musculoskeletal Conditions""",Impact and Control of Chronic Low Back Pain and Balance in Older Adults,Fall Prevention and Balance Improvement in the Elderly

Methods: Thirty-two healthy individuals (25.3 ± 5.6 years; 68.8 ± 12.5 kg; 172.0 ± 8.8 cm) were tested on four occasions 1 week apart. ROM through a passive straight leg raise, jumping performance through a standing long jump (SLJ) and balance through the Y-balance test were measured. Each measure was assessed before (T0), immediately after (T1) and after 15 min (T2) of the provided intervention. On the first occasion, no intervention was administered (CG). The intervention order was randomized across participants and comprised static stretching (SS), proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) and the PTR technique. A repeated measure analysis of variance was used for comparisons. Results: No differences across the T0 of the four testing sessions were observed. No differences between T0, T1 and T2 were present for the CG session. A significant time × group interaction for ROM in both legs from T0 to T1 (mean increase of 5.4° and 4.9° for right and left leg, respectively) was observed for SS, PNF and the PTR. No differences for all groups were present between T1 and T2. No differences in the SLJ and in measures of balance were observed across interventions. Conclusions: The PTR is equally effective as SS and PNF in acutely increasing ROM of the lower limbs. However, the PTR results less time-consuming than SS and PNF. Performance and balance were unaffected by all the proposed interventions. © 2022, The Author(s).",Balance; Long jump; Positional transversal release; ROM; Stretching,adult; analysis of variance; article; clinical article; controlled study; female; group dynamics; human; human experiment; jumping; leg; lower limb; male; neuromuscular facilitation; randomized controlled trial; range of motion,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Muscle Strength and Recovery in Sports Performance

In the last decade, aerobic endurance training has emerged as a promising intervention to alleviate these symptoms and improved aerobic fitness has been suggested as a key moderator variable. In the present study, we investigated, whether aerobic fitness is associated with fewer cognitive deficits and negative symptoms and with GMVs and WMVs in individuals with schizophrenia in a cross-sectional design. In the largest study to date on the implications of fitness in individuals with schizophrenia, 111 participants at two centers underwent assessments of negative symptoms, cognitive functioning, and aerobic fitness and 69 underwent additional structural magnetic resonance imaging. Multilevel Bayesian partial correlations were computed to quantify relationships between the variables of interest. The main finding was a positive association of aerobic fitness with right hippocampal GMV and WMVs in parahippocampal and several cerebellar regions. We found limited evidence for an association of aerobic fitness with cognitive functioning and negative symptoms. In summary, our results strengthen the notion that aerobic fitness and hippocampal plasticity are interrelated which holds implications for the design of exercise interventions in individuals with schizophrenia. © 2022, The Author(s).",,chlorpromazine; adult; aerobic exercise; Article; bicycle ergometry; brain size; Calgary Depression Scale; cerebellum vermis; cognition; cognitive defect; cross-sectional study; depression; female; gray matter volume; human; image quality; major clinical study; male; mental performance; multicenter study; negative syndrome; nerve cell plasticity; neuroanatomy; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; parahippocampal gyrus; Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; right hippocampus; schizophrenia; white matter,"""Cognitive Decline Prevention and Improvement through Exercise and Therapeutic Interventions""",Exercise Interventions and Cognitive Function in Older Adults,Exercise and Cognitive Function in Aging Adults

The purpose of this study was to systematically review published studies to evaluate regional variation in the epidemiology of and surgical approaches to primary, isolated PCL reconstruction. Methods: A systematic review was performed in June 2022 to identify studies examining operative techniques during primary, isolated PCL reconstruction. Collected variables consisted of reconstruction technique, graft type, graft source, tibial reconstruction technique, femoral and tibial drilling and fixation methods, and whether the remnant PCL was preserved or debrided. Studies were classified into four global regions: Asia, Europe, North America, and South America. Results: Forty-five studies, consisting of 1461 total patients, were identified. Most of the included studies were from Asia (69%, n = 31/45). Single bundle reconstruction was more commonly reported in studies out of Asia, Europe, and North America. Hamstring autografts were utilized in 51.7% (n = 611/1181) of patients from Asia and 60.8% (n = 124/204) of patients from Europe. Trans-tibial drilling and outside-in femoral drilling were commonly reported in all global regions. The PCL remnant was generally debrided, while remnant preservation was commonly reported in studies from Asia. Conclusion: Surgical treatment of isolated PCL injuries varies by region, with the majority of published studies coming from Asia. Single-bundle reconstruction with hamstring autograft through a trans-tibial approach is the most commonly reported technique in the literature, with males reported to undergo isolated reconstruction more often than females.

During periods of social isolation experienced by the COVID-19 pandemic, home-based exercise programs were strongly recommended as a strategy to facilitate exercise practice and reduce the negative impacts of social isolation. Remotely supervised exercise stands out as an easily accessible strategy after the pandemic, as it is a tool that aims to facilitate access to exercise by this population. The purpose of the RED study is to verify the effects of a remotely supervised home-based exercise program compared to a control group on cardiometabolic, functional, and psychosocial outcomes in patients with T2D. Methods: Participants are randomized into the control group (CG) and the intervention group (IG). Participants allocated to the CG receive recommendations for the practice of physical activity based on information from chapters of the Physical Activity Guide for the Brazilian Population, while the IG will perform a 12-week home-based exercise program supervised remotely by video call. The intervention has a weekly frequency of two sessions per week on non-consecutive days during the first 6 weeks and three sessions per week on non-consecutive days for the remaining 6 weeks. The RED study has HbA1c as the primary outcome, and the participants’ cardiometabolic, functional, and psychosocial parameters are assessed at baseline (week 0) and post-intervention (week 13). Discussion: Expected results of the proposed study will provide the knowledge base of health professionals and deliver more evidence for a growing area, i.e., home-based exercise and T2D. Additionally, this protocol aims to verify and demonstrate whether this program can be accessible and effective for different health outcomes in patients with T2D.

Methods: In a double-blind, randomised, cross-over trial, 12 healthy caffeine-habituated and unacclimatised males cycled to exhaustion in the heat (35 °C, 40% RH) at an intensity associated with the thermoneutral gas exchange threshold, on two separate occasions, 60 min after ingesting caffeine (5 mg/kg) or placebo (5 mg/kg). Results: There was no effect of caffeine supplementation on cycling time to exhaustion (TTE) (caffeine; 28.5 ± 8.3 min vs. placebo; 29.9 ± 8.8 min, P = 0.251). Caffeine increased pulmonary oxygen uptake by 7.4% (P = 0.003), heat production by 7.9% (P = 0.004), whole-body sweat rate (WBSR) by 21% (P = 0.008), evaporative heat transfer by 16.5% (P = 0.006) and decreased estimated skin blood flow by 14.1% (P < 0.001) compared to placebo. Core temperature was higher by 0.6% (P = 0.013) but thermal comfort decreased by − 18.3% (P = 0.040), in the caffeine condition, with no changes in rate of perceived exertion (P > 0.05). Conclusion: The greater heat production and storage, as indicated by a sustained increase in core temperature, corroborate previous research showing a thermogenic effect of caffeine ingestion. When exercising at the pre-determined gas exchange threshold in the heat, 5 mg/kg of caffeine did not provide a performance benefit and increased the thermal strain of participants. © The Author(s) 2024.",Caffeine supplementation; Endurance performance; Ergogenic; Heat; Thermoregulation,,"""Effects of Different Factors on Muscle Performance and Metabolism""",Exercise and Muscle Performance in Different Individuals,Effects of Exercise and Supplementation on Performance and Health

Results from nearly 60,000 patient encounters",2024,Journal of Orthopaedics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185448113&doi=10.1016%2fj.jor.2024.01.015&partnerID=40&md5=24e18ef71a92411db545e377cbce5e89,"Background: It remains unclear what role depression screening plays in routine ambulatory orthopedic care. The purpose of this study was to determine (1) the floor and ceiling effects of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Depression (PROMIS-D) form, (2) the prevalence of positive PROMIS-D screening forms across an orthopedic service line, and (3) the prevalence of previously diagnosed depression and interventions among a representative sample of patients. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed 58,227 patients who presented to ambulatory orthopedic clinics across an orthopedic service line between January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2021. All patients completed a self-administered PROMIS-D form as part of the ambulatory encounter. Scores were analyzed with respect to patient characteristics including age, gender, and presenting orthopedic complaint. A sample of 1000 patients was evaluated for prevalence of depressive symptoms and formal psychiatric diagnosis and interventions in the 5 years preceding the clinic visit. Results: PROMIS-D displayed a negligible ceiling effect (<0.001 %) but a large floor effect (19.0 %). PROMIS-D scores indicating depressive symptoms were highest among patients presenting with spine complaints (42.8 %) and lowest among patients presenting to orthopedic pediatric clinics (28.6 %). Women and those in the lowest quartile median household income (MHI) were more likely to report depressive symptoms. Among the 1000 patient sample, 31.3 % exhibited depressive symptoms. Of these, 39 % had previously received some form of mental health treatment, including 33.2 % who were prescribed antidepressants. Conclusions: PROMIS-D is a useful screening questionnaire for patients in the orthopedic clinic, although there is a consistent floor effect. There are a number of patients who present to the orthopedic clinic who have depressive symptoms but have had no interaction with behavioral health. Given the impact depression can have on outcomes, screening for depressive symptoms should be considered as part of routine orthopedic practice. © 2024 Professor P K Surendran Memorial Education Foundation",Depression; Mental health; Patient-reported outcomes; PROM; PROMIS,antidepressant agent; adolescent; adult; age; aged; Article; controlled study; depression; female; gender; household income; human; major clinical study; male; mental health; orthopedic surgeon; orthopedics; Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Depression; prescription; prevalence; retrospective study; risk factor; scoring system; social isolation; spine disease,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Shoulder Surgery Outcomes and Measures

To address this, simultaneous and proportional control (SPC) based on continuous estimation of joint angles through surface electromyogram (sEMG) signals offers a more seamless interaction between users and their prosthetic limbs than conventional pattern recognition-based control, which relies on recognizing pre-defined movement classes from specific sEMG patterns using classification algorithms. This study proposes a deep learning-based model (AM-BiLSTM) that integrates the attention mechanism (AM) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network to provide an accurate and robust SPC for estimating knee joint angle during running from a minimal number of sEMG sensors. The sEMG signals of four muscles recorded from 14 subjects during treadmill running at various speeds were utilized by the AM-BiLSTM model to decode knee joint kinematics. To comprehensively investigate the generalizability of the proposed model, it was tested in intra-subject and speed, intra-subject and inter-speed, and inter-subject and speed scenarios and compared with BiLSTM, standard LSTM, and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) approaches. Normalized root-mean-square error and correlation coefficient were used as performance metrics. According to nonparametric statistical tests, the proposed AM-BiLSTM model significantly outperformed the BiLSTM network as well as classical techniques including LSTM and MLP networks in all three experiments (p-value < 0.05) and achieved state-of-the-art performance. Based on our findings, the AM-BiLSTM model may facilitate the deployment of intuitive user-driven deep learning-based control schemes for a wide variety of miniaturized robotic lower-limb devices, including myoelectric prostheses. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Attention mechanism; Bidirectional long short-term memory; Continuous estimation; Deep learning; LSTM; Myocontrol; Running; Surface electromyography (sEMG),Brain; Coordination reactions; Deep neural networks; Joints (anatomy); Kinematics; Mean square error; Pattern recognition; Physiological models; Attention mechanisms; Bidirectional long short-term memory; Continuous estimation; Deep learning; LSTM; Memory modeling; Myocontrol; Running; Surface electromyography; adult; Article; biceps femoris muscle; controlled study; correlation coefficient; deep neural network; discrete wavelet transform; gastrocnemius muscle; human; human experiment; kinematics; knee; long short term memory network; male; normal human; rectus femoris muscle; recurrent neural network; root mean squared error; running; semitendinous muscle; short time Fourier transform; surface electromyography; tibialis anterior muscle; transfer of learning; treadmill exercise; vastus medialis muscle; velocity; Long short-term memory,"""Application of Machine Learning and Biomechanics in Musculoskeletal Health and Wearable Devices""","Knee Assessment and Recovery: Validity, Reliability, and Clinical Trials",Wearable Devices and Techniques in Gait Analysis and Mobility Rehabilitation

Despite achieving this threshold, abnormal lower limb biomechanics continue to persist in athletes after ACLR. Symmetry in single-leg vertical hop height appears to be more difficult to achieve and can be a better representation of knee function than single-leg horizontal hop distance. Purpose: To explore whether an LSI of >90% for single-leg vertical hop height can represent normal lower limb biomechanics in athletes during a bilateral vertical jump after ACLR. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: According to the LSI for single-leg vertical hop height, 46 athletes who had undergone ACLR with an autologous ipsilateral bone–patellar tendon–bone or hamstring tendon graft were divided into a low symmetry group (LSI <90%; n = 23) and a high symmetry group (LSI >90%; n = 23), and 24 noninjured athletes were selected as the control group. The kinematic and kinetic characteristics during a bilateral vertical jump were compared between the low symmetry, high symmetry, and control groups. Results: During the propulsion phase of the bilateral vertical jump, the operated side in the high symmetry group showed a lower knee extension moment than the nonoperated side (P =.001). At peak vertical ground-reaction force, the operated side in the high symmetry group showed a lower knee internal rotation moment compared with the control group (P =.016). Compared with the nonoperated side, the operated side in the high symmetry group showed a higher hip extension moment (P =.002), lower knee extension moment (P <.001), lower ankle plantarflexion moment (P <.001), and lower vertical ground-reaction force (P =.023). Conclusion: Despite achieving an LSI of >90% for single-leg vertical hop height, athletes after ACLR showed abnormal lower limb biomechanical characteristics during the bilateral vertical jump. Clinical Relevance: Symmetrical single-leg vertical hop height may not signify ideal biomechanical or return-to-sports readiness in this population. © The Author(s) 2024.",anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; bilateral vertical jump; biomechanics; limb symmetry index; return to sports; single-leg vertical hop height,adult; ankle; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; article; athlete; biomechanics; clinical article; clinical significance; controlled study; ground reaction force; hamstring tendon; human; joint mobility; knee function; lower limb; male; patellar ligament; retrospective study; return to sport; surgery; tendon graft; young adult,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Advancements and Outcomes of Knee Arthroplasty and Rehabilitation Techniques

It is urgent to explore ways to ameliorate aging-related cognitive decline. Cognitive–exercise dual-task intervention has shown beneficial effects on improving cognition in aging cohorts, but the mechanisms of the effects remain unclear. In this study, 18-month-old Sprague Dawley rats served as a model of natural aging. First, the performance in the Morris water maze test and the change in synaptophysin content in the hippocampus were used to investigate the cognitive decline of 18-month-old rats. Then, a batch of 18-month-old rats was treated with cognitive, exercise, or cognitive–exercise dual-task intervention for 12 weeks. The novel object recognition test was used to assess cognitive ability. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting were used to detect the levels of oxidative stress molecules and synaptic plasticity-related proteins. We found that cognitive–exercise dual-task intervention improved the discrimination index of natural aging rats. After dual-task intervention, the expression levels of synaptophysin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase were increased, and the expression level of lipid peroxide malondialdehyde was decreased. Furthermore, the effect of dual-task intervention on synaptic plasticity-related proteins and oxidative stress indicators was greater than that of single cognitive or exercise intervention. In conclusion, cognitive–exercise dual-task intervention can significantly ameliorate aging-related cognitive decline, and the improvement might be related to the reduction of oxidative stress and the enhancement of synaptic plasticity. The effect of cognitive–exercise dual-task intervention may be better than that of single cognitive or exercise intervention. © 2022 The Author(s)",Aging; Cognitive decline; Dual-task intervention; Oxidative stress; Synaptic plasticity,"Aging; Animals; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Hippocampus; Maze Learning; Neuronal Plasticity; Oxidative Stress; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Synaptophysin; brain derived neurotrophic factor; glutathione peroxidase; malonaldehyde; superoxide dismutase; synaptophysin; synaptophysin; aged; aging; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; cognition; cognitive aging; cognitive defect; cognitive exercise dual task intervention; controlled study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; exercise; female; hippocampus; intervention study; male; Morris water maze test; nerve cell plasticity; nonhuman; novel object recognition test; oxidative stress; protein expression; rat; Sprague Dawley rat; therapy effect; Western blotting; aging; animal; cognition; cognitive defect; maze test; metabolism; oxidative stress; psychology","""Cognitive Decline Prevention and Improvement through Exercise and Therapeutic Interventions""",Exercise Interventions and Cognitive Function in Older Adults,Exercise and Cognitive Function in Aging Adults

Methods: Prospectively collected data were analysed for patients undergoing RA-TKA. A cruciate retaining cemented design was implanted using the MAKO® robotic system. Lower limb alignment at 0°, 30°, 45°, 60° and 90° of flexion was recorded at the beginning of surgery and finally after implantation of the components. A ligament tensioner was inserted after tibial precut to measure the extension and flexion gap, and final component placement was planned based on 3D CT images. Femoral and tibial component placement was measured in all three planes. Results: A total of 104 patients were included (mean age 69.4 ± 9 years; 44 male, 60 female). The difference in component placement after planning and final implantation showed less valgus of 0.7° ± 1.4° (p < 0.001), less external rotation of 0.6° ± 1.9° (p = 0.001) and less flexion of 0.9° ± 1.8° (p < 0.001) for the femoral component. The tibial component was placed in more varus of 0.2° ± 0.9° (p = 0.056) and more posterior slope of 0.5° ± 0.9° (p < 0.001). The lower limb alignment in extension was 4.4° ± 5.2° of varus of the native knee and changed to 1.2° ± 1.9° of varus after TKA (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Robotic-assisted TKA helps to achieve the target of alignment and component placement very close to the planning. It allows optimal component placement of off-the-shelf implants respecting patient's specific anatomy. Level of Evidence: Level II. © 2024 The Authors.

Therefore, it is important to identify possible associations of this pathologic shoulder condition to find more effective treatment options. Purpose: To perform a comprehensive analysis of all parameters reported to be associated with a C1 shoulder—including the osseous shoulder morphology, scapulothoracic orientation, and the muscle volume of the shoulder girdle in a single patient cohort. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A retrospective, comparative study was conducted analyzing 17 C1 shoulders in 10 patients who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the complete depiction of the trunk from the base of the skull to the iliac crest, including both humeri. The mean age of the patients was 33.5 years, and all patients were men. To measure and compare the osseous shoulder morphology (glenoid version, glenoid offset, humeral torsion, anterior acromial coverage, posterior acromial coverage, posterior acromial height, and posterior acromial tilt) and scapulothoracic orientation (scapular protraction, scapular internal rotation, scapular upward rotation, scapular translation, scapular tilt, and thoracic kyphosis), these patients were matched 1 to 4 according their age, sex, and affected side with shoulder-healthy patients who had received positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography. To measure and compare the muscle volume of the shoulder girdle (subscapularis, infraspinatus/teres minor, supraspinatus, trapezius, deltoid, latissimus dorsi/teres major, pectoralis major, and pectoralis minor), patients were matched 1 to 2 with patients who had received PET-MRI. Patients with visible pathologies of the upper extremities were excluded. Results: The C1 group had a significantly higher glenoid retroversion, increased anterior glenoid offset, reduced humeral retrotorsion, increased anterior acromial coverage, reduced posterior acromial coverage, increased posterior acromial height, and increased posterior acromial tilt compared with controls (P <.05). Decreased humeral retrotorsion showed significant correlation with higher glenoid retroversion (r = −0.742; P <.001) and higher anterior glenoid offset (r = −0.757; P <.001). Significant differences were found regarding less scapular upward rotation, less scapular tilt, and less thoracic kyphosis in the C1 group (P <.05). The muscle volume of the trapezius and deltoid was significantly higher in the C1 group (P <.05).

Several therapies have been proposed for pain relief and functional recovery, including physical therapy, minimally invasive injection approaches, and physical agent modalities such as laser therapy. Methods: Our study evaluates the impact of high-power laser therapy (HPLT) on pain and functioning. The HPLT protocol consists of 10 daily sessions using a LASERIX PRO device. The healthy elbow of each participant was also considered as a control group. The outcomes assessed were the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for pain, QuickDASH questionnaire for functionality, and shear wave velocity (SWS) through ultrasonography. Assessments were conducted at baseline (T0), post-treatment (T1), and 2-week follow-up (T2). Results: Sixteen participants (81.2% male, mean age 40.4 ± 5.53 years) completed the study. Post-treatment, pain significantly decreased (NRS: T0 6.13 ± 0.96; T1 2.75 ± 1.69; p < 0.001), functionality improved (QuickDASH: T0 69.88 ± 10.75; T1 41.20 ± 3.78; p < 0.001), and shear wave velocity increased (SWS (m/s): T0 1.69 ± 0.35; T1 2.56 ± 0.36; p < 0.001). Conclusions: At the 2-week follow-up, pain relief was maintained, and shear wave velocity showed no further significant change. Shear wave velocity assessments might be considered a useful diagnostic tool. However, further research is needed to support the role of HPLT and shear wave velocity in the rehabilitation management of LE. © 2024 by the authors.",high-power laser therapy; HILT; lateral epicondylitis; shear wave velocity; ultrasonography,,"""Advancements and Efficacy of Therapies in Orthopedics and Sports Medicine""",Clinical Analysis and Trials in Therapy Treatments,Management and Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

The Rapid Weight Loss Questionnaire (RWLQ) is a self-reported tool designed to identify and characterize such weight loss practices. Objectives: After developing a reliable and reproducible French version of the RWLQ (RWLQ-FR), the present study aims to analyse RWL patterns among French weight-class athletes and to point out potential relationships between such practices and risk of subsequent weight gain. Methods: A test-retest analysis was performed in 54 athletes to test the questionnaire reproducibility before applying it in a cohort of 168 weight-cycling athletes (23.78 ± 9.25 y, 67.6 ± 12.6 kg, 81 males and 87 females, n = 24 strength sports and n = 144 various combat sports). Results: The test-retest showed good agreement of the RWLQ-FR (Rho = 0.794, [0.696–0.893]). Athletes reported losing an average of 4.1 ± 2.9% of their initial weight in 13.1 ± 9.6 days, with the main methods used being an increase in exercise, training in rubber or plastic suits, and gradual dieting. The average weight recovery in a week was 3.5 ± 2.8% and results showed that the athletes with the lower inter-season weight (weight outside of the training and competition season) regained the more weight (p = 0.025). The average RWLQ-FR score was 31.9 ± 17.3 and athletes who began to lose weight earlier in their competitive carrier had the higher scores (p = 0.032). Conclusion: The present study demonstrates relationships between the pattern of RWL practices and potential increased risk of subsequent weight gain in weight-cycling athletes, and the need to better understand the long-term health-related risks. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Body mass; Cardiometabolic risk; Self-reported tool; Weight-category sports,Athletes; Female; Humans; Male; Martial Arts; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires; Weight Gain; Weight Loss; laxative; adult; Article; athlete; body composition; body mass; body weight gain; body weight loss; exercise; female; human; major clinical study; male; physical activity; questionnaire; social media; training; weight cycling; athlete; body weight gain; body weight loss; martial art; questionnaire; reproducibility,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Effects of different training methods on athletic performance and injury prevention

Despite prior safety concerns regarding physical exertion, exercise training as a supportive therapy is now recommended for PH patients. Currently, most programmes are hospital-based, which limits accessibility. There is a need to provide alternative approaches for physical activity engagement for PH patients. The aim of this research was to develop, implement and evaluate the safety, feasibility and effectiveness of home-based physical activity intervention for PH. Methods An entirely remotely delivered home-based physical activity intervention underpinned by behaviour change theory and informed by end-users, was assessed using a single-arm feasibility study design. Participants (n=19; 80% female) with a mean±SD age of 49.9±15.9 years with a diagnosis of PH undertook a 10-week, home-based physical activity intervention with induction training, support materials, telecommunication support, health coaching, exercise training and assessments, all remotely delivered. Training involved respiratory training along with a combination of aerobic and resistance exercises. Results The intervention was deemed safe as no adverse events were reported. A high level of feasibility was demonstrated as the protocol was implemented as intended, sustained a high level of engagement and adherence and was well accepted by participants in terms of enjoyment and utility. There was a significant improvement in functional capacity, physical activity, exercise self-efficacy and quality of life, between baseline and post-training. Conclusion The study demonstrates that an entirely remotely delivered home-based physical activity programme is safe, feasible and effective in improving functional capacity, physical activity and quality of life in PH patients. © The authors 2024.",,adult; aerobic bacterium; Article; behavior change; breathing rate; chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension; controlled study; decision making; electrocardiography; electromyography; exercise; exercise intensity; fatigue; feasibility study; female; follow up; functional status; heart catheterization; heart rate; hospitalization; human; human experiment; lung artery pressure; male; middle aged; numeric rating scale; outcome assessment; oxygen saturation; physical activity; physical capacity; pulmonary artery occlusion pressure; pulmonary hypertension; quality of life; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; resistance training; six minute walk test; sternotomy; telecommunication; telemetry; thorax pain; training; walking,"""Effects of Exercise and Lifestyle Modification on Diabetes, Obesity, and Cardiovascular Health""",Effects of Exercise Programs on Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Health Outcomes,Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation and Exercise Training

We investigated (i) the acute effects of different types of stretching, i.e. constant length (CL) and constant force (CF) stretching, on acute deformations and changes in passive mechanical properties of medial gastrocnemius muscle (MG) and (ii) the association of acute muscle–tendon deformations or changes in mechanical properties with the impulse or maximal strain of stretching. Forty-eight hindlimbs from 13 male and 12 female Wistar rats (13 weeks old, respectively 424.6 ± 35.5 and 261.8 ± 15.6 g) were divided into six groups (n = 8 each). The MG was initially stretched to a length at which the force was 75%, 95%, or 115% of the force corresponding to estimated maximal dorsiflexion and held at either CF or CL for 30 min. Before and after the stretching protocol, the MG peak force and peak stiffness were assessed by lengthening the passive muscle to the length corresponding to maximal ankle dorsiflexion. Also, the muscle belly length and tendon length were measured. CF stretching affected peak force, peak stiffness, muscle belly length, and tendon length more than CL stretching (p < 0.01). Impulse was associated only with the decrease in peak force, while maximal strain was associated with the decrease in peak force, peak stiffness, and the increase in muscle belly length. We conclude that CF stretching results in greater acute deformations and changes in mechanical properties than CL stretching, which appears to be dependent predominantly on the differences in imposed maximal strain. © 2023 The Author(s)",Contracture; Impulse; Medial gastrocnemius; Strain; Tendon,"Animals; Ankle Joint; Female; Humans; Male; Muscle Stretching Exercises; Muscle, Skeletal; Range of Motion, Articular; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Tendons; Muscle; Stiffness; Tendons; Constant force; Contracture; Dorsiflexions; Gastrocnemius muscle; Hind limbs; Impulse; Maximal strain; Medial gastrocnemius; Pathological conditions; Peak force; animal experiment; animal tissue; anthropometric parameters; Article; constant force; constant force muscle stretching; constant length; controlled study; female; gastrocnemius muscle; hindlimb; lateral gastrocnemius muscle; male; medial gastrocnemius muscle; muscle belly length; muscle stretching; musculoskeletal system parameters; nonhuman; peak force; peak stiffness; rat; soleus muscle; tendon length; animal; ankle; human; physiology; range of motion; skeletal muscle; stretching exercise; tendon; Wistar rat; Strain","""Effects of Different Therapeutic Interventions on Muscular and Neural Health""",Muscle Rehabilitation and Training Effects in Injury Recovery,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Our hypothesis was that the PYC implants would provide good outcomes without major glenoid erosion. Additionally, we hypothesized that HA-PYC allowed for remodeling of the bone. Methods: Patients underwent HA with PyC humeral head for treatment of primary or secondary osteoarthritis, excluding post-traumatic cases. All patients had a Constant Score assessed preoperatively and at the last follow-up. Preoperative and postoperative computed tomography scans at the last follow-up were performed to achieve 3-dimensional reconstructions of the scapulae. Deformities of the glenoid surface were analyzed as a distance differential between postoperative and preoperative to investigate potential bone remodeling vs. glenoid erosion. The subluxation index (SLI) was measured. Results: We included 41 patients implanted with a HA-PYC. Average age at the time of implant was 63.8 (40 to 79 years). All patients were followed for ≥2 years with an average follow-up of 36.3 months (24 to 60 months). Constant Scores increased from 34 at baseline to 80 at the last follow-up points on average (P < .01). Return to work rate was 100% and 96% had resumed their physical activity. Ten (77%) of the 13 patients with posterior head subluxation had normalized their SLI. Furthermore, no significant differences were detected between the individuals having corrected their posterior subluxation and the others (preoperative SLI between 0.45 and 0.55). Glenoid wear is less than 0.6 mm at 3 years mean follow-up, ie, 5 times less than metallic implants. A tendency to recenter the head in the anteroposterior plane was found in type B glenoid, without increased erosion of the glenoid, with very good clinical results. We did not find any difference according to age or glenoid type for clinical and radiological results. Conclusion: HA-PYCs give, in the short term, excellent clinical results in terms of pain and function. The development of a precise and objective measurement method has made it possible to demonstrate that the glenoid surface is the site of modifications that may be part of bone remodeling or progression of the osteoarthritis disease. © 2023 The Author(s)",Case Series; Glenohumeral arthritis; Glenoid erosion; Hemiarthroplasty; Level IV; Posterior glenoid bone loss; Posterior subluxation; Pyrocarbon; Shoulder arthroplasty; Treatment Study,pyrolytic carbon; acromioplasty; adult; aged; Article; aseptic necrosis; Bankart repair; biceps brachii muscle; bone remodeling; clinical article; clinical assessment; clinical outcome; computer assisted tomography; Constant Murley (score); deformity; disease course; erosion; female; follow up; general anesthesia; glenoid cavity; hemiarthroplasty; human; humeral head; male; model; osteoarthritis; osteolysis; osteophyte; osteotomy; outcome assessment; pain; patient satisfaction; physical activity; physiotherapy; postoperative period; preoperative evaluation; range of motion; regional anesthesia; rehabilitation care; retrospective study; return to work; scapula; shoulder arthritis; shoulder arthroplasty; subluxation; surgical technique; tendinitis; tenodesis; tenotomy; treatment outcome,"""Shoulder Joint Health and Rehabilitation: Arthroscopic Surgeries, Treatments and Outcomes""",Clinical Outcomes and Treatments in Shoulder Care,Shoulder Surgery Outcomes and Measures

However, the effects of specific intensities of physical activity on SO and the optimal amount of physical activity for lowering the prevalence of SO have not been well studied. This study aimed to identify the effects of physical activity levels and intensity on SO and the optimal amount of physical activity related to a lower prevalence of SO. This cross-sectional study used data from the nationwide Korean Frailty and Aging Cohort Study (KFACS), which included 2071 older adults (1030 men, 1041 women). SO was defined according to the criteria of the European Society for Clinical Nutrition Metabolism (ESPEN) and the European Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the association between the physical activity level and SO. The high activity group had a significantly lower prevalence of SO than the non-high activity (low and moderate activity) group. On the other hand, moderate-intensity physical activity was associated with a lower prevalence of SO. A total physical activity energy expenditure of > 3032 kcal/week (433 kcal/day) for men and 2730 kcal/week (390 kcal/day) for women was associated with a reduced prevalence of SO. The high physical activity and total physical energy expenditure described above may be beneficial for reducing the prevalence of SO. © 2024 by the authors.",aging; physical activity; sarcopenic obesity,,"""Physical Activity and Health Outcomes in Aging Populations""",Physical Activity and Health in Older Adults,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Microfragmented adipose tissue (MFAT) is another orthobiologic that holds promise, but data supporting its use are limited. Previous studies showed that MFAT created using the Lipogems device was equivalent to PRP created via noncommercial laboratory-based processes. Purpose: To perform a comparison of commercially available MFAT and PRP systems for treatment of knee OA. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: A total of 71 patients with symptomatic knee OA (Kellgren-Lawrence grades 1-4) were randomized to receive a single injection of either leukocyte-rich PRP (Angel; Arthrex) or MFAT (Lipogems) under ultrasound guidance. Patient-reported outcomes (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS], visual analog scale for pain with activities of daily living [VAS pain], and Tegner activity level) were recorded at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after injection. The primary outcome was the KOOS-Pain subscale score at 12 months after injection. Results: Overall, 49 patients completed their 12-month follow-up (PRP group, n = 23; MFAT group, n = 26). All demographic features were similar between groups, except that more men were randomized to the PRP group and more women to the MFAT group. At 12 months posttreatment, KOOS-Pain scores improved in both groups, with no significant group difference (PRP, 78 ± 17.9 vs MFAT, 77.8 ± 19.3; P =.69). Similarly, other KOOS subscales, VAS pain scores, and Tegner scores improved at 12 months, with no differences between treatment groups. Conclusion: Both PRP and MFAT injections for knee OA resulted in improved patient-reported outcomes at 12 months posttreatment, with no differences found between treatments.

However, much less is known about effectively engaging and sustaining patients in rehabilitation. There is a need to understand the full range of potential intervention strategies. Methods: We conducted a mapping review of UK review-level evidence published 2017–21. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL) and conducted a narrative synthesis. Included reviews reported factors affecting commencement, continuation or completion of cardiac or pulmonary rehabilitation, or an intervention to facilitate these factors. Study selection was undertaken independently by two reviewers. Results: In total, we identified 20 review papers that met our inclusion criteria. There was a bias towards reviews considering cardiac rehabilitation, with these numbering 16. An additional 11 unpublished interventions were also identified through internet searching of key websites. The reviews included 60 identifiable UK primary studies that considered factors which affected attendance at rehabilitation; 42 considered cardiac rehabilitation and 18 considering pulmonary rehabilitation. They reported on factors from the patients’ point of view, as well as the views of professionals involved in referral or treatment. It was more common for factors to be reported as impeding attendance at rehabilitation rather than facilitating it. We grouped the factors into patient perspective (support, culture, demographics, practical, health, emotions, knowledge/beliefs and service factors) and professional perspective (knowledge: staff and patient, staffing, adequacy of service provision and referral from other services, including support and wait times). We found considerably fewer reviews (n = 3) looking at interventions to facilitate participation in rehabilitation. Although most of the factors affecting participation were reported from a patient perspective, most of the identified interventions were implemented to address barriers to access in terms of the provider perspective. The majority of access challenges identified by patients would not therefore be addressed by the identified interventions. The more recent unevaluated interventions implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic may have the potential to act on some of the patient barriers in access to services, including travel and inconvenient timing of services. Conclusions: The factors affecting commencement, continuation or completion of cardiac or pulmonary rehabilitation consist of a web of complex and interlinked factors taking into consideration the perspectives of the patients and the service providers. The small number of published interventions we identified that aim to improve access are unlikely to address the majority of these factors, especially those identified by patients as limiting their access. Better understanding of these factors will allow future interventions to be more evidence based with clear objectives as to how to address the known barriers to improve access. © 2023 Blank et al.",,,"""Physical Activity, Rehabilitation, and Health Outcomes in Medical Conditions""",Impact of Exercise and Rehabilitation on Quality of Life and Health in Patients,Post-COVID-19 Syndrome and Rehabilitation Strategies

Tailored, meaningful, and culturally sensitive PA health messages may be a catalyst to shape men's motivations toward participation. Objective: We explored the views of New Zealand (NZ) men with PD about existing PA health messages, and how these could be adapted to be more effective. Methods: This qualitative study recruited six community dwelling, regularly physically active, NZ European men with PD (aged 54–69 years, 2–18 years post-diagnosis) from a community exercise class in Canterbury, NZ. Participants engaged in semi-structured interviews which were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed inductively for themes. Results: Participants expressed that effective PA health messages should reflect men's motivations for PA which included physical and mental well-being and social connection. Inclusive, positive, and relatable language and imagery were considered crucial PA message communication strategies. Participants viewed health professionals' PA advice as superficial and unhelpful; however, celebrities with PD were considered inspirational messengers. Messages endorsed by trustworthy sources, such as the Parkinson's Society, were perceived to enhance the credibility. Conclusions: Effective PA messages should be gain framed and tailored to the target audience. We recommend health professionals provide comprehensive PA advice or consider onward referral. Future research which uses a co-design participatory methodology to collaborate with men with PD from culturally diverse backgrounds and represent all stages of PA behaviour change is recommended to provide comprehensive insights for meaningful, effective, and culturally sensitive PA health messaging. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Health messaging; Men; Parkinson's disease; Physical activity,Disabled Persons; Exercise; Humans; Language; Male; Men; Parkinson Disease; Qualitative Research; adult; aged; Article; cycling; golf; human; interpersonal communication; interview; major clinical study; male; middle aged; motivation; New Zealand; Parkinson disease; physical activity; psychological well-being; qualitative research; quality of life; semi structured interview; social connectedness; swimming; walking; wellbeing; disabled person; exercise; language,"""Physical Activity and Health Outcomes in Aging Populations""",Physical Activity and Health in Older Adults,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

The epidemiology of health problems in wheelchair basketball has been prospectively studied only during the Paralympic Games, the 2018 World Championships, the 2021 South America Wheelchair Basketball Championship, and one season of two American intercollegiate wheelchair basketball teams. The objective of the study was to prospectively monitor and analyze the prevalence, incidence, burden, and characteristics of injuries and illnesses in a wheelchair basketball league during an entire season for the first time. Methods: All players of the highest German wheelchair basketball league (Bundesliga) were invited to participate in the study. Included players completed the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center Questionnaire once a week during the entire season 2020/21 to report health problems. Exposure was captured by self-reported training time and officially-recorded competition time. Results: Sixty of 117 players (51%, 47 male, 13 female) of the national league participated with an average response of 93%. Seventy health problems (5.5/1000 exposure hours [95% CI: 4.9–6.1]) were reported, including 54 injuries and 16 illnesses. Prevalence of health problems was 60% (95% CI: 48–72). Most injuries affected the shoulder (32% of all injuries), cervical spine/neck (17%), and hand (13%). More overuse injuries (2.9/1000 exposure hours [95% CI: 2.5–3.3]) than acute injuries (1.3/1000 exposure hours [95% CI: 1.0-1.6]) occurred. Of all health problems, 53% were associated with time-loss. The incidences of all health problems, illnesses, injuries, and overuse injuries were higher in women than in men. Conclusions: Characteristics and frequency of injuries and illnesses during wheelchair basketball season differed from those during major wheelchair basketball tournaments. The high proportion of overuse injuries and the higher injury rates in women should be regarded in the development of individualized prevention measures. Since results from previous studies during major tournaments are only partially comparable to wheelchair basketball league play, further studies should follow. © 2023, The Author(s).",Epidemiology; Health monitoring; Injury prevention; Injury surveillance; Paralympic sports; Wheelchair basketball,adult; anatomical location; Article; basketball player; cervical spine; cohort analysis; competition; controlled study; disease burden; disease severity; female; human; major clinical study; male; morbidity; neck; prevalence; prospective study; questionnaire; sex difference; shoulder; sport injury; wheelchair basketball,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Injury Risk and Performance in Athletes

Methods: A prospective study of 106 patients with a mean age of 72.6 (SD 7.4) years undergoing primary TKA was performed. Physical, social and leisure activities performed by the patients preoperatively and postoperatively at 3-year were recorded. Activities were selected according to the age, and grouped as passive, moderate and high intensity. The energy spent in each activity was expressed in Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) units. Charlson Comorbidity Index, Mini-mental test and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) scores were also used. Multivariate analysis was used to identify predictors of active patients. Results: Mean WOMAC significantly improved from preoperative (34.8, SD 11.8) to final follow-up (74.4, SD 11.1) (p = 0.001), and the mean energy spent increased from 10.7 (SD 13.6) to 28.2 (SD 16.2) MET-hour weekly (p = 0.001) with a decrease in the passive activities and increase in the moderate activities. However, the participation in high-intensity activities according to age was negligible. Only 65 (61.3%) patients were considered active postoperatively (weekly spending ≥ 40 MET), although the WOMAC scores were not significantly different between active and sedentary patients. Active patients compared with sedentary patients had a significant increase in engagement in physical, social and leisure activities, and a decrease in passive activities. Female gender (p = 0.037), less preoperatively participation in passive activities (p = 0.042), and greater participation in social activities (p = 0.027) were significant predictors of active patients at the final follow-up. Conclusion: Overall, most patients increased their activity level postoperatively.

Players often suffer a variety of injuries, the most common being injuries to muscles and tendons. It is striking that with soccer, being the most practiced sport, and considering that most injuries occur in the lower extremities, plantar fasciitis (PF) is not one of the most frequent injuries (at least in terms of clinical data collected). The purpose of this review was to provide a comprehensive update of the topic “plantar fasciitis” focusing on soccer players. The review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reportiog ltems for Systmiatic reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. PubMed, Cochrane Library and Scopus were researched. PICO (Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; and Outcome) components were identified. The keywords used were “plantar fasciitis”, “plantar fasciitis and sport”, “plantar fasciitis risk factors”, “plantar fasciitis soccer” and “plantar fasciitis football players”. With respect to the objective proposed for the research, we found eight specific articles focused on soccer. Of these, five were general reviews discussing the different methods of treatment of this pathology, and we have only found three studies that focused on PF in soccer, with two of them referring to a clinical case whereby the report and discussion only dealt with the specific treatment followed by the soccer player. After reviewing the manuscripts included in this work, we were surprised that there is no data in which the Silfverskiöld test was performed, as this test explores the passive mobility of the ankle and the degree of dorsiflexion in the supine position. We concluded that soccer players suffer pain in the sole of the foot compatible with plantar fasciitis; however, as indicated by Suzue et al., it is often not diagnosed because the athlete does not consider performing the clinical examinations necessary for its diagnosis. The shortage of reported publications in soccer may mask other PF-associated injuries. © 2022 by the authors.",biomechanics; foot; plantar fasciitis; soccer; sport; systematic review,"Ankle; Ankle Joint; Fasciitis, Plantar; Foot; Humans; Soccer; biomechanics; health risk; injury; literature review; meta-analysis; pathology; physical activity; risk factor; sport; ankle; ankle dorsiflexion angle; Article; biomechanics; etiology; foot sole; heel pain; human; nerve compression; plantar fasciitis; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; risk factor; search engine; soccer; soccer player; sport; supine position; sural nerve; systematic review; foot; physiology; plantar fasciitis; soccer","""Lower Extremity Health and Biomechanics: Studies on Pain, Function, and Treatment Methods""",Lower Limb Biomechanics and Pain Management in Chronic Conditions,Effects of Training Protocols on Injury Prevention and Performance in Soccer and Futsal Players

The aim of our study is to compare outcomes between operatively and nonoperatively managed Achilles ruptures in young adults (age 18-30 years), which has not been previously evaluated. Methods: At a single institution, all patients aged 18-30 years at time of injury who underwent treatment for an acute ATR from 2014 to 2021 were evaluated. Medical records were reviewed to collect demographics, dates of injury and treatment, smoking status, body mass index (BMI), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), rate of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) after treatment, and rate of rerupture. Patients then completed Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) physical function (PF) and pain interference (PI) questionnaires. Mann-Whitney nonparametric testing was used to evaluate for any statistical differences in PROMIS scores. Results: Sixty-six operative patients qualified and 28 (42%) participated. Thirty-seven nonoperative patients qualified and 14 (38%) participated. All patients had a CCI of 0. One patient in the operative cohort and 2 in the nonoperative reported active smoking. In the operative and nonoperative cohorts, respectively, the average age was 24.4 and 27.8 years; average BMI 26.5 (SD = 4.8) and 27.3 (SD = 4.3, P =.52); DVT rates 4 (6.1%) and 2 (5.4%); and rerupture rates 2 (3.0%) and 1 (2.7%), respectively. PROMIS scores did not differ in the operative and nonoperative groups: PROMIS PF mean of 60.4 (SD = 9.8) and 62.9 (SD = 9.1), respectively (P =.33); as well as PROMIS PI mean of 44.6 (SD = 5.9) and 43.9 (SD = 6.5), respectively (P =.59). Conclusion: This study should be interpreted with the understanding that we had a considerable loss to follow-up rate. In the study cohort, we found that young adults with ATR may be considered for either operative or nonoperative management.

Dysfunction or rupture of the posterior tibial tendon (PTT) is a fairly common cause of acquired adult flatfoot. Conservative and surgical treatments are used to correct PTT dysfunction. Objective. The aim of this study was to present the characteristic features of PTT dysfunction and evaluate the application and effectiveness of selected physiotherapeutic methods in the treatment of posterior tibial muscle insufficiency. Materials and Methods. Available literature was analyzed based on English‑language databases such as PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Medline, and others, using the Google Scholar search engine. A total of 20 articles were analyzed out of 52 identified through the aforementioned method. Publications no older than 10 years were included as search criteria, using the following keywords: posterior tibial muscle insufficiency, orthoses, orthopedic insoles, flatfoot, physiotherapy. Results. It was not possible to specify which method of treating posterior tibial muscle insufficiency is the most effective. Conclusions. Contemporary research suggests that conservative treatment methods appear to be effective in treating posterior tibial muscle insufficiency. Although opinions on the effectiveness of orthoses are divided, the majority acknowledges that orthoses improve the functioning of patients with posterior tibial tendon dysfunction (PTTD). © 2023, DJ Studio.

The purpose of this systematic review was to synthesise and qualitatively assess the currently available evidence in the literature regarding the re-revision of ACL reconstruction (rrACLR). Methods: A systematic review was conducted based on the PRISMA guidelines. The following search terms were used in the title, abstract and keywords fields: “ACL” or “anterior cruciate ligament” AND “revision” or “multiple” or “repeat”. The outcome data extracted from the studies were the Lysholm score, Subjective IKDC, Marx Score, Tegner, Marx Score, KOOS score, radiological changes and the rate of return to sports. Complications, failures and/or revision surgery were also analysed. Results: The cohort consisted of 295 patients [191 (64.7%) men and 104 (35.3%) women] with a mean age of 29.9 ± 2.8 years (range 14–58 years) from 10 studies. The mean postoperative follow-up (reported in all studies except one) was 66.9 ± 44.7 months (range 13–230.4 months). Associated injuries were 103 (34.9%) medial meniscus tears, 57 (19.3%) lateral meniscus tears, 14 (4.7%) combined medial plus lateral meniscus tears, 11 (3.7%) meniscal tears (not specified), 252 (85.4%) cartilage lesions, 6 (2.0%) medial collateral ligament injury and 2 (0.7%) lateral collateral ligament injuries. In 47 (15.9%) patients an extra-articular plasty was performed for the anterolateral ligament. In all studies that reported pre- and post-operative IKDC (subjective and objective) and Lysholm score, there was a significant improvement compared to the pre-operative value (p < 0.05). At the final follow-up, laxity measured with KT-1000 was found to be 2.2 ± 0.6 mm. 31 (10.5%) out of 295 patients returned to their pre-injury activity level. A total of 19 (6.4%) re-ruptures were found, while only 4 (1.4%) complications (all minors) were reported, out of which 2 (0.7%) were superficial infections, 1 (0.3%) cyclops lesion and 1 (0.3%) flexion loss. Conclusion: Multiple revisions of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction allow acceptable clinical results and a good degree of knee stability with a low rate of subsequent new re-ruptures but the possibility of regaining pre-injury sports activity is poor; whenever possible, it is preferred to revise the ligament in one stage. This surgery remains a challenge for orthopaedic surgeons and many doubts persist regarding the ideal grafts, additional extra-articular procedures and techniques to use. Level of evidence: IV.

Global positioning system (GPS) data was collected on 48 AF players from 39 matches and 28 training sessions across two seasons. Match data was analysed using the ball in play (BiP) method with the maximum BiP period for each match (e.g. the BiP with greatest meters per minute), for each variable (relative distance, high-speed running, and accelerations) averaged for each player to establish maximal means as reference points. Intensity of all BiP periods in matches and SSGs was compared (e.g. a BiP period recorded at 100 m·min−1 by a player with a maximal mean of 200 m·min−1, was classified as a 50% effort). This was categorised in 10% intensity buckets, and compared between matches and SSGs using linear mixed models and Cohen's d effect sizes. Distance was greater (p < 0.01) in the 20–49% buckets for matches and in the 60–89% buckets (p < 0.001) for SSGs. For high-speed running and accelerations, matches were greater (p < 0.001) in the 0–9% bucket but SSGs were greater (p < 0.001) in buckets from 20 to 49%. At the individual level, 37–49% of the players did not record any SSGs efforts in buckets of >80 to ≥90% across GPS variables. SSGs appear to provide a sub-optimal training stimulus, if the aim is to prepare AF players for the highest intensity periods of play recorded during matches, thus may under-prepare players for the intensity demands of AF matches. © The Author(s) 2022.",Acceleration; ball in play; global positioning system; high-speed running; training,,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Results: A total of 70 sessions of ABRT over a 10-week timeframe again reduced the overproduction of urine, but not completely to pre-SCI baseline levels. DDAVP treatment maintained but did not further reduce the level of urine output in the ABRT group without continuous exercise, demonstrating either intervention/treatment alone is effective, despite no additive effect. Although intake did not change from pre-injury levels despite polyuria, DDAVP treatment also reduced drink volume. Conclusions: Further studies are needed as the mechanisms underlying changes in fluid and solute balance are likely multi-factorial involving a complex interaction between the neural (both central and peripheral) control of systems mediating thirst, urinary output, and cardiovascular regulation. © The Academy of Spinal Cord Injury Professionals, Inc. 2022.",Contusion; DDAVP; Kidney; Step training; Vasopressin,"Animals; Child; Deamino Arginine Vasopressin; Humans; Male; Polyuria; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Spinal Cord Injuries; Urination; desmopressin; gentamicin; ketamine; meloxicam; penicillin G; placebo; procaine penicillin; xylazine; argipressin[1 deamino]; activity based recovery training; adult; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cohort analysis; continuous training; controlled study; male; nonhuman; polyuria; rat; residual urine; spinal cord injury; training; treadmill exercise; treatment outcome; urinary tract infection; voided volume; Wistar rat; animal; child; complication; human; micturition; polyuria; spinal cord injury","""Effects of Different Therapeutic Interventions on Muscular and Neural Health""",Muscle Rehabilitation and Training Effects in Injury Recovery,Spinal Cord Injury and Exercise Rehabilitation

This study aimed to compare characteristics and outcomes for patients participating in CR with and without an existing cancer diagnosis. Method: Observational cohort study including consecutive patients enrolled in a single-centre outpatient CR program in Western Sydney between 2018-2022. Clinical history, demographics and CR outcome data were collected as part of standard care at program enrolment and completion. Patients with and without a cancer diagnosis were compared at enrolment and outcomes were analysed in both groups. Results: A total of 1,792 patients enrolled in CR, 191 (11%) had a documented history of cancer; prostate (18%), skin (12%), colon (9%) and breast (8%) malignancies were most prevalent. The most common treatments were surgical resection (80%) and chemotherapy or radiotherapy (37%). Cardio-oncology patients were older (68.8±10.6 vs 59.8±13.7yrs, p<0.001), more likely female (33% vs 21%, p<0.001), born in Australia (46% vs 35%, p=0.004), non-partnered (34% vs 25%, p=0.002) and had a prior history of hypertension (65% vs 56%, p=0.010) or stroke (8% vs 5%, p=0.045). After adjusting for age and sex, the overall cohort improved their mean peak exercise capacity and waist circumference after CR, however there were no differences between groups. There were also no between-group differences for adherence and completion of CR program or any other cardiovascular risk factors. Sub-analyses revealed a clinically meaningful improvement in waist circumference for cancer patients with a history of radiation therapy and a blunted peak exercise capacity adaptation for those with a history of chemotherapy treatment. Conclusions: Despite differences in demographic and clinical characteristics of CR patients with and without cancer, all patients showed significant and clinically relevant improvements in peak exercise capacity and waist circumference after CR. Results also highlighted potential associations between specific cancer treatments and changes in fitness outcomes, which warrants further evaluation. © 2023 The Author(s)",Cardio-oncology; Exercise capacity; Rehabilitation,,"""Physical Activity, Rehabilitation, and Health Outcomes in Medical Conditions""",Impact of Exercise and Rehabilitation on Quality of Life and Health in Patients,Exercise Programs and Physical Activity in Cancer Recovery

Therefore, the objective of this systematic review was to analyze the effects of FR on jumping ability in athletes. Material and method: A comprehensive, exhaustive, and structured search was carried out following PRISMA recommendations in the following databases: Pubmed/MEDLINE, Cochrane, Scopus, Sciencedirect and Web of Science. The studies that met the inclusion criteria were assessed for their methodological quality using the PEDro scale. Results: A total of 262 records were found in the study identification phase. In the screening phase, duplicates were eliminated, and the studies were filtered by selecting the title, abstract and keywords, obtaining 47 references as a result. A total of 18 studies were analyzed in full text, 12 of which were excluded. Therefore, the total number of studies that met all the selection criteria was six. Conclusions: The selected studies show that the application of RF is a technique that contributes to increasing the performance of jumping capacity in athletes and its effect can last up to 10 minutes after its application. However, protocols and duration times should be standardized to maximize results. © 2023 Archivos de Medicina del Deporte.

Various techniques in the literature for biceps tenodesis have been described, such as whether to do it open or arthroscopically, suprapectoral or subpectoral, as well as the type of fixation to be used. However, the optimal option is still debatable. In this Technical Note, we describe an arthroscopic technique for distal suprapectoral biceps tenodesis using a knotless corkscrew anchor that has many advantages, such as being an all-arthroscopic with the ability to retension the tendon after implantation.

The study assessed and compared the effects of clinic-based and telemonitored home-based interventions on pain intensity, functioning and quality of life in patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Material and methods. Forty-two patients were recruited purposely and randomly allocated into clinic-based (CBG) and telemonitored home-based group (THG) equally. The CBG and THG received isometric exercises to strengthen the quadriceps and hamstring muscles using theraband. THG received the exercise at home they were monitored on phone thrice in a week, while the CBG did the exercise in the hospital. The subjects performed four sets of eight repetitions three days in a week for eight weeks. Pain intensity, functioning and health related quality of life (HRQoL) were assessed at pretreatment, 6th and 8th week of intervention. Data was analyzed with descriptive and inferential statistics. Alpha level was set at 0.05. Results. There was a significant reduction (p<0.001) among pre-treatment, 6th and 8th week intervention in pain intensity, functional pain intensity and quality of life of CBG and THG. CBG showed significant reduction (p<0.001) in pain intensity, function and increase in HRQoL than THG at 8th week. Conclusion. Clinic-based and telemonitored home-based interventions were both effective in the management of KOA but clinic-based intervention was better than telemonitored home-based intervention. © 2024 Publishing Office of the University of Rzeszow.

Strength and endurance are important functional physical indexes for assessing muscle condition. However, the correlation between sagittal parameters and paraspinal muscle strength/endurance is not yet clear. The purpose of this study was to analyze the correlation between strength/endurance of paraspinal muscles and sagittal parameters in patients with DSD. Methods: There were 105 patients with DSD and 52 healthy volunteers (control group) enrolled. They were divided into the balance group [sagittal vertical axis (SVA) < 5 cm, n = 68] and imbalance group (SVA ≥ 5 cm, n = 37). The maximal voluntary exertion (MVE)/Endurance time (ET) of paravertebral muscles were assessed using the prone position test stand, and the sagittal parameters of the subjects were measured, namely, SVA, thoracic kyphosis (TK), lumbar lordosis (LL), pelvic incidence (PI), pelvic tilt (PT), and sacral slope (SS). Pearson coefficients were used to assess the correlation between paraspinal muscle MVE/ET and sagittal parameters. Results: MVE and ET of paravertebral muscles in the control group were significantly higher than those in the balance and imbalance groups (P < 0.05), whereas MVE in the balance group was significantly higher than that in the imbalance group (P < 0.05). SVA in the imbalance group was significantly higher than those in the control and balance groups (P < 0.05). SS and TK in the control group were significantly higher than those in the imbalance group (P < 0.05), and PT and PI in the control group were significantly lower than those in the balance and imbalance groups (P < 0.05). LL in the imbalance group was significantly lower than that in the balance and control groups (P < 0.05). MVE, MVE/BH, and MVE/BW of paraspinal muscles in the imbalance group were negatively correlated with SVA and PT. Moreover, they were positively correlated with LL. Conclusions: Deformity may cause the decrease of MVE and ET of paraspinal muscles in the prone position in patients with DSD. Furthermore, the decline in MVE of paraspinal muscles may be a predisposing factor for the imbalance observed. The decrease of MVE/BW of paraspinal muscles may be involved in spinal compensation, and it is a sensitive indicator for sagittal imbalance and lumbar lordosis. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Correlation; Endurance; Paraspinal muscles; Sagittal parameters; Strength,Humans; Kyphosis; Lordosis; Lumbar Vertebrae; Paraspinal Muscles; Quality of Life; Retrospective Studies; adult; aged; Article; China; controlled study; correlation analysis; degenerative spinal deformity; endurance; endurance time; female; hospital; human; kyphosis; lumbar lordosis; major clinical study; male; maximal voluntary exertion; middle aged; muscle strength; musculoskeletal system parameters; paraspinal muscle; patient; pelvic incidence; pelvic tilt; prone position; sacral slope; sagittal parameter; sagittal vertical axis; spine malformation; thoracic kyphosis; diagnostic imaging; kyphosis; lordosis; lumbar vertebra; paraspinal muscle; quality of life; retrospective study,"""Balance, Mobility, and Fall Risks in Aging and Musculoskeletal Conditions""",Impact and Control of Chronic Low Back Pain and Balance in Older Adults,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

The LSEs consisted of squats, lunges, and standing leg curls. All exercises were performed 3 times a week for 6 weeks. Changes in thigh muscle strength, plantar foot pressure (weight transfer), and golf performance, such as club head speed, ball speed, and carry distance were measured before and after the exercise program. Right knee extension (P<0.001) and left knee extension and flexion (P<0.001) strength were higher in the LSE+BFR group than in the LSE group. The changes in plantar foot pressure confirmed that smooth weight transfer appeared in E1 (event 1) (address) (P<0.05) of the LSE+BFR group, which confirmed that the carry distance (P<0.05) of the LSE+BFR group improved after the exercise program.

Physical activity is an important part of the treatment program in psychiatric hospitals. However, when individuals with mental health disorders (IMHD) leave the hospitals in Switzerland (CH), there are few possibilities to do physical activity in a given setting. One of them are voluntary sports groups for individuals with mental health disorders (SGPSY), which have been growing continuously in CH since 2016. Yet, little is known about these groups and their training settings. Therefore, the present study explores challenges, barriers, and enablers for participation in SGPSY from the point of view of the trainers of these groups. Additionally, as the sustainable implementation of SGPSY relies on the trainer, the study aims to identify reasons/motivations as well as the personality characteristics of the SGPSY trainers. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 trainers of SGPSY in CH during spring 2022. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis in nVivo. Participants identified several intrapersonal (lack of motivation and fitness, mood problems, etc.), interpersonal (conflicts between participants), and structural barriers (time/ location) that hinder IMHD from participating in SGPSY. The participating trainer reported that trainer might be helpful in overcoming the barriers by supporting IMHD as enablers. They rate social skills to be essential for the successful management and organization of SGPSY, as well as the ability to set boundaries to protect one’s private life and sports skills expertise. The reasons for their engagement as trainers of SGPSY were the satisfaction of doing sports with IMHD and to improve the physical activities habits of IMHD. The findings of the study highlight the need to upskill the trainers of SGPSY in order to improve recruitment of the future trainers of SGPSY by focusing on the assessment of appropriate personality characteristics of trainers and their motives. Additionally, these findings should be integrated in the educational materials of Swiss disabled sports systems. Further research should validate the results from SGPSY participants’ point of view.

Methods: Forty-two male athletes [mean ± standard deviation, age: 21.4 ± 3.4 years], who had undergone ACLR and had cleared to return to activity, were included in this study. Real-time ultrasound images of VMO, RF, and VL thicknesses were obtained from both reconstructed and contralateral limbs. Concentric quadriceps peak torque at 60°/s and 180°/s, single-leg hop for Distance (SLHD), and self-reported knee function scores were also assessed. Linear regression analysis and student t tests were used for statistical analysis. Results: In reconstructed limb, greater VMO, RF, and VL thicknesses were associated with greater quadriceps peak torque at 60°/s (p = .008, r2 = 0.46) and at 180°/s (p = .006, r2 = 0.47). Greater quadriceps thickness was related to greater SLHD score in reconstructed limb (p = .002, r2 = 0.21). Self-reported knee function scores were not related to quadriceps thickness. VMO, RF, and VL thicknesses were smaller in reconstructed limb compared to contralateral limb (p < .001, p = .01, and p = .002, respectively). Conclusion: Quadriceps thickness by using ultrasound was associated with concentric quadriceps strength and single-leg hop distance in individuals who had undergone ACLR. However, quadriceps thickness was not related to self-reported knee function. The ultrasonography may be included in the evaluation of the knee function after ACLR, and it may be a useful and easy method in the follow-up of the quadriceps strength recovery following ACLR. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",knee joint; quadriceps strength; single-leg hop; Ultrasound,Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Athletes; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Muscle Strength; Quadriceps Muscle; Young Adult; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; article; athlete; case report; clinical article; cross-sectional study; echography; follow up; human; knee function; linear regression analysis; male; muscle thickness; muscle training; quadriceps femoris muscle; real time echography; rectus femoris muscle; torque; vastus lateralis muscle; vastus medialis muscle; young adult; adolescent; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament injury; athlete; cross-sectional study; knee; muscle strength; physiology,"""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Advancements and Outcomes of Knee Arthroplasty and Rehabilitation Techniques

Design: Randomized, controlled trial design. Methods: Fifty-six children (10 and 11 years) were randomly assigned to static (n = 14), quasi-dynamic (n = 14) and dynamic balance training (n = 15), or a control group (n = 13). One-legged static (i.e., unipedal stance on stable surface), quasi-dynamic (i.e., unipedal stance on unstable surface), and dynamic balance (i.e., jumping and stabilizing in unipedal stance on unstable surface) were assessed using two dependent variables, i.e., center of pressure surface area (CoP SA) and velocity (CoP V) with opened (OE) and closed (CE) eyes; as well as lower limbs muscle power (i.e., standing long jump test [SLJ] and countermovement jump [CMJ height]). Results: A significant group × test interactions were observed for static (CoP SA OE; p < 0.05, d = 1.18), quasi-dynamic (CoP SA CE; p < 0.05, d = 0.80), dynamic (CoP V CE; p < 0.05, d = 0.87) balance and power (SLJ [p < 0.05, d = 0.87] and CMJ height [p < 0.01, d = 2.66]) tests. Post hoc analysis showed that DBT demonstrated greater improvement in the measure of balance (p < 0.05, d = 0.80 to 5.17) and power (p < 0.05, d = 2.66 to 3.65) performance. Conclusions: To enhance balance and muscle power performance in prepubertal children, it appears that the level of difficulty in balance training may influence the observed effects. © 2023 Sports Medicine Australia",Dose–response relation; Jumping performance; Training intensity; Youth,article; child; clinical article; controlled study; dependent variable; dose response; female; human; jumping; juvenile; leg muscle; male; muscle strength; post hoc analysis; randomized controlled trial; standing; surface area; training,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Evaluation and Improvement of Postural Balance and Muscle Strength

We aimed to analyze the published literature on ICWM for COVID-19 at home and abroad, and compare their differences on hotspots and research fronts. Methods: Publications before Oct 31, 2022 were retrieved from the Web of Science core database (WOS), PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure database (CNKI), Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform (Wanfang), China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), China Biology Medicine disc (CBM), CiteSpace and VOSviewer to summarize the basic characteristics of publications, countries, institutions, keywords, and citations. Results: We included 580 English papers and 1727 Chinese papers in this study. The development trends in China and other countries are relatively asynchronous and show a smooth growth trend for the future. The most productive countries were China, India, and the United States, while the most productive domestic research institution was the Beijing University of Chinese Medicine. The clustering analysis of high-frequency keywords showed that Chinese literature focused on clinical studies of ICWM for COVID-19, such as retrospective studies, clinical features, and traditional Chinese medicine syndrome analysis, while English literature focused on therapeutic mechanism studies and evidence-based medicine studies, such as systematic reviews and meta-analysis, and both of them paid attention to network pharmacological research and Qingfei Paidu Decoction. Sorting out the top 10 highly cited articles, Huang CL's article published in Lancet in 2020 was regarded as a cornerstone in the field. Conclusion: The treatment of COVID-19 by ICWM has become a worldwide research hotspot. Although there are differences in the specific contents among countries, the development trend of research types to the mechanism of action, and the development trend of research contents to the recovery period treatment and the prevention of COVID-19 by ICWM are consistent. © 2024 The Authors",Bibliometric analysis; COVID-19; Integrating Chinese and Western medicine; Treatment,,"""Impacts of COVID-19 on Physical and Mental Health, Exercise Habits, and Rehabilitation Strategies""","Impact of COVID-19 on Health, Physical Activity and Quality of Life",Post-COVID-19 Syndrome and Rehabilitation Strategies

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of telerehabilitation, combining diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, on young men with upper crossed syndrome during the COVID-19 pandemic over 4 weeks. Methods: The study included 37 participants aged in their 20s and 30s who were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group received diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, while the control group only underwent shoulder stabilization exercises. Both groups were trained three times a week for four weeks using telerehabilitation. The comparison of within-group pre–post differences in the experimental and control groups was conducted using a paired t-test, while the effects of treatment were assessed using repeated-measures analysis of variance. Results: After 4 weeks, both groups showed significant improvements in the pain pressure threshold of the upper trapezius, craniovertebral angle, round shoulder posture, shoulder tilt degree, neck disability index, and closed kinetic chain upper extremity stability test (all p < 0.05). The results showed a significant difference between the Time effect (p adj < 0.05/4) for both sides of PPT, CVA, and STD and both sides of RSP, NDI, and CKCUEST, and an interaction between the Time × Group effects (p adj < 0.05/4) for the Rt.

Methods: Data were assessed at baseline (T0, participants were inactive or had recently become active), after a ten-week physical activity intervention (T1), and a second 24-week intervention phase (T2). Latent class growth analysis was used on accelerometer-assessed weekly MVPA and daily SB, respectively (n = 215 eligible participants). Activity changes within trajectory classes and baseline social-cognitive predictor differences between trajectory classes were analyzed. Results: A “stable insufficient MVPA” (n = 197, p for difference in MVPA level at T0 and T2 (pT0-T2) =.789, effect size (Cohen’s d) =.03) and a “stable high MVPA” trajectory (n = 18, pT0-T2 =.137, d =.39), as well as a “slightly decreasing high SB” (n = 63, p for difference in SB (pT0-T2) =.022, d =.36) and a “slightly increasing moderate SB” trajectory (n = 152, pT0-T2 =.019, d =.27) emerged. Belonging to the “stable high MVPA” trajectory was associated with higher action planning levels compared to the “stable insufficient MVPA” trajectory (M = 5.46 versus 4.40, d =.50). Belonging to the “decreasing high SB” trajectory was associated with higher action self-efficacy levels compared to the “increasing moderate SB” trajectory (M = 5.27 versus 4.72, d =.33). Conclusions: Change occurred heterogeneously in latent (not directly observed) subgroups, with significant positive trajectories only observed in the highly sedentary.

Objectives: To compare the iliotibial tract thickness of people with PFP and asymptomatic people; and to correlate the iliotibial tract thickness with self-reported pain and function of people with PFP. Methods: Eighty women, separated into two groups: PFP group (n = 40) and control group consisting of asymptomatic participants (CG; n = 40). The participants answered the Anterior Knee Pain Scale (AKPS) questionnaire, to identify the self-reported knee function; they evaluated the pain in millimeters by the Visual Analog Scale for pain (VAS). For the imaging evaluation, an ultrasound was used, with a linear transducer at the distal portion of the iliotibial tract (coronal plane), with the participants positioned in dorsal decubitus, with 20° of knee flexion. The iliotibial band was visualized in its long axis, and three sequential images were recorded between the lateral femoral condyle and the lateral tibial condyle. The measurements were normalized and correlated. Results: The groups had no differences (P > 0.001) between participants for: age/weight/height/IMC. Participants in the PFP group had moderate levels of pain (58 + 2.1 mm), considerable self-reported functional limitation (d = 3.05) and greater iliotibial tract thickness compared with the CG (d = 2.41). Conclusion: The iliotibial tract of women diagnosed with PFP have greater thickness compared with asymptomatic women.

Design: A prospective, single-blinded, randomised controlled trial. Setting: Single medical centre. Participants: Patients with adhesive capsulitis (N = 62) were divided into group A: ultrasound-guided hydrodilatation with hyaluronic acid + physical therapy (N = 31) and group B: physical therapy alone (N = 31). Interventions: Group A received three doses of ultrasound-guided hydrodilatation with hyaluronic acid-based injectates (20 mL in total). Both groups underwent structured physical therapy. Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure was Constant score, while secondary outcomes included Shoulder Pain and Disability Index score, numerical rating scale (at rest, night, and during motion), 36-item Short Form Health Survey, and range of motion of the shoulder. All measurements were collected at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks post-injection. Results: At week 12, the Constant scores were 68.29 ± 14.55 and 62.77 ± 14.44 for groups A and B, respectively.

Purpose: To analyze return to play (RTP) and changes in performance of players in the National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) after ACLR. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: NWSL players who sustained an ACL tear and underwent surgery between the 2013 and 2020 seasons were identified by multiple online resources. Players were classified as forwards, defenders, midfielders, and goalkeepers. RTP was assessed according to games played, games started, percentage of minutes played, plus/minus net per 90 minutes (a measure of a player’s contribution to their team’s performance while on the field), goals scored, and assists. A subanalysis was performed based on the median age at the time of the injury (≤24 vs ≥25 years). Nonparametric testing methods were used throughout the analysis. Results: A total of 30 NWSL athletes were included. Midfielders had the highest percentage of injuries (n = 11; 36.7%), followed by forwards (n = 10; 33.3%). Overall, 27 players returned to the NWSL at a median of 12.1 months (IQR, 10.9-14.3 months), constituting a 90.0% RTP rate. There was a significant decrease in the percentage of minutes played from 1 year before the injury to 1 year after the injury (median, 87.9% [IQR, 80.7%-90.6%] vs 25.1% [IQR, 16.3%-57.2%], respectively; P =.031). Forwards and midfielders had a significant decrease in the number of assists from 1 year before the injury to 1 year after the injury (median, 3.0 [IQR, 1.0-3.0] vs 0.0 [IQR, 0.0-1.0], respectively; P =.037) as well as the number of goals scored when averaging across 2 seasons before the injury to 2 seasons after the injury (median, 3.0 [IQR, 1.5-5.5] vs 1.0 [IQR, 0.5-3.5], respectively; P =.031). On subanalysis, older players started in significantly more games (median, 12.0 [IQR, 3.8-18.5] vs 3.0 [IQR, 0.5-6.0], respectively; P =.048) and had a higher percentage of minutes played (median, 63.0% [IQR, 18.8%-77.3%] vs 14.9% [IQR, 2.0%-21.2%], respectively; P =.046) at 1 year after the injury versus younger players. Conclusion: There was a 90.0% RTP rate after ACLR in the NWSL.

A limitation of this measure is minimal attention to movement of the pelvis on the femur that can create knee valgus loading. The dynamic valgus index (DVI) may be a better assessment. Hypothesis/Purpose The purpose of this study was to compare the knee FPPA and DVI between females with and without PFP and determine if the DVI better identified females with PFP than the knee FPPA. Study Design Case-control Methods Sixteen females with and 16 without PFP underwent 2-dimensional motion analysis when performing five trials of a single-leg squat. The average peak knee FPPA and peak DVI were analyzed. Independent t-tests determined between-group peak knee FPPA and peak DVI differences. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves determined the area under the curve (AUC) scores for sensitivity and 1-specificity of each measure. Paired-sample area difference under the ROC curves was conducted to determine differences in the AUC for the knee FPPA and DVI. Positive likelihood ratios were calculated for each measure. The significance level was p < 0.05. Results Females with PFP exhibited a higher knee FPPA (p = 0.001) and DVI (p = 0.015) than controls. AUC scores were .85 (p = 0.001) and .76 (p = 0.012) for the knee FPPA and DVI, respectively. Paired-sample area difference under the ROC curves showed a similar (p = 0.10) AUC for the knee FPPA and DVI. The knee FPPA had 87.5% sensitivity and 68.8% specificity; the DVI had 81.3% sensitivity and 81.0% specificity. Positive likelihood ratios for the knee FPPA and DVI were 2.8 and 4.3, respectively.

This study aimed to compare hydrotherapy and land-based therapy with varying immobilization time. Methods: Patients who underwent RCR with a 10-days or 1-month immobilization duration (early or late rehabilitation) were prospectively randomized. Results: Constant scores significantly differed at three months only, with the best score exhibited by the late hydrotherapy group (70.3 ± 8.2) followed by late land-based (61.0 ± 5.7), early hydrotherapy (55.4 ± 12.8) and early land-based (54.6 ± 13.3) groups (p < 0.001). There was a significant interaction between rehabilitation type and immobilization duration (p = 0.004). The effect of hydrotherapy compared to land-based therapy was large at three months when initiated lately only (Cohen’s d, 1.3; 95%CI, 0.9–1.7). However, the relative risk (RR) of postoperative frozen shoulder or retear occurrence for late hydrotherapy was higher compared to early hydrotherapy (RR, 3.9; 95%CI, 0.5–30.0). Conclusions: Hydrotherapy was more efficient compared to land-based therapy at three months only and if initiated lately. Even though initiating hydrotherapy later brought greater constant scores at three months, it might increase the risk of frozen shoulders or retear compared to early hydrotherapy. © 2024 by the authors.",arthroscopic rotator cuff repair; constant score; hydrotherapy; immobilization duration; land-based therapy; rehabilitation,adult; Article; cohort analysis; Constant Murley (score); controlled study; female; frozen shoulder; functional status; human; hydrotherapy; immobility; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; middle aged; postoperative complication; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; rehabilitation protocol; risk factor; rotator cuff repair; rotator cuff rupture; time to treatment,"""Shoulder Joint Health and Rehabilitation: Arthroscopic Surgeries, Treatments and Outcomes""",Clinical Outcomes and Treatments in Shoulder Care,Shoulder Surgery Outcomes and Measures

Purpose: To identify the overall rate of complications following proximal hamstring tendon repair and to differentiate these complications into categories. Study Design: Systematic review; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Included in this review were studies that examined surgical repair of proximal hamstring tendon ruptures; all studies were in English and had an evidence level of 4 or higher. No restrictions were made regarding publication date or methodological quality. Data regarding complications were extracted to calculate the overall complication rate as well as the rate of major and minor complications. A quantitative data synthesis was conducted using the chi-square test to compare the proportion of patients who experienced complications with the endoscopic versus open approach. Results: A total of 43 articles including 2833 proximal hamstring tendon repairs were identified. The overall postoperative complication rate was 15.3% (n = 433). The rate of major complications was 4.6%, including a 1.7% rate of sciatic nerve injury, 0.8% rate of venous thromboembolism, 0.8% reoperation rate, 0.8% rerupture rate, and 0.4% rate of deep infection. Minor complications included a 2.4% rate of posterior femoral cutaneous nerve injury, 2.3% rate of persistent hamstring myopathy, 2.2% rate of persistent sitting pain, 1.8% rate of peri-incisional numbness, 1.1% rate of superficial infection, and 0.8% rate of hematoma/seroma.

The aim of this study was to compare the primary stability of a classic Latarjet procedure with 2 metal screws to a novel metal-free, all-suture cerclage method. It is hypothesized that fixation of the coracoid graft with 2 malleolar screws will provide higher primary stability compared with an all-suture cerclage technique. Methods: This biomechanical in vitro study was conducted on 12 fresh-frozen cadaveric shoulders (6 matched pairs) with a mean donor age of 80 years (range, 67-89 years). Coracoid graft fixation was performed using a recently introduced all-suture cerclage technique (group A) or a classic Latarjet technique with two 4.5-mm malleolar screws (group B). The conjoint tendon was loaded with a static force of 10 N to simulate the sling effect. Graft loading with a probe head consisted of 6 ascending load levels (10-50 N, 10-100 N, 10-150 N, 10-200 N, 10-250 N, and 10-300 N) with 100 cycles each at 1 Hz. Relative motion of the bone graft to the glenoid was measured using an optic 3-dimensional system. Results: While loading the conjoint tendon with 10 N, no difference in mean displacement of the bone-graft was found between both groups (P = .144). During cyclic loading, a significant difference in relative displacement for both groups was already detected in load level 1 (group A: 2398.8 μm vs. group B: 125.7 μm; P = .024), and this trend continued with the following load levels (P < .05). Discussion and Conclusion: The study demonstrated that the innovative metal-free, all-suture cerclage fixation technique results in higher micromotion than the classic coracoid graft fixation with 2 malleolar screws. According to the present biomechanical investigation, shoulders treated with a metal-free all-suture cerclage technique might need adapted rehabilitation protocols to protect the construct and allow for graft healing. © 2023 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees",Basic Science Study; biomechanical; Biomechanics; FiberTape cerclage; Latarjet; metal-free Latarjet; primary graft stability; suture cerclage,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biomechanical Phenomena; Bone Transplantation; Bursitis; Humans; Joint Instability; Scapula; Shoulder Dislocation; Shoulder Joint; Sutures; acromion; Article; biomechanics; bone graft; cadaver; cerclage; controlled study; coracoid process; cortical bone; female; glenoid cavity; human; in vitro study; intermethod comparison; Latarjet procedure; male; osteotomy; scapula; shoulder; simulation; statistical analysis; Student t test; tendon; x-ray computed tomography; aged; bone transplantation; bursitis; joint instability; shoulder dislocation; shoulder joint; very elderly","""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Shoulder Pathologies and Treatment Techniques

The present study aimed at determining the prevalence of MSPs with regard to sport disciplines and athletic status. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 320 Senegalese professional and amateur athletes practicing football, basketball, rugby, tennis, athletics, and wrestling. Rates of MSPs in the past year (MSPs-12) and week (MSPs-7d) were assessed using standard questionnaires. Results: Overall proportions of MSPs-12 and MSPs-7d were 70 and 74.2%, respectively. MSPs-12 were more frequently reported on shoulders (40.6%), neck (37.1%) and hips/thigh (34.4%), while MSPs-7d were predominant on hips/thigh (29.5%), shoulders (25.7%), and upper back (17.2%). Proportions of MSPs-12 and MSPs-7d varied significantly by sport disciplines, with highest values among basketball players. Again, highest MSPs-12 proportions on shoulders (29.7%, P = 0.02), wrists/hands (34.6%, P = 0.001), (40.2%, P = 0.0002), and knees (38.8%, P = 0.002) were seen among basketball players. High proportions of MSPs-7d were seen on shoulders (29.6%, P = 0.04) for tennis players, wrists/hands (29.4%, P = 0.03) for basketball and football players, and hips/thigh (38.8%, P < 0.00001) for basketball players. Football players had reduced risk of MSPs-12 by 75% on lower back (OR = 0.25; 95% CI. 0.10—0.63; P = 0.003) and by 72% on knees (OR = 0.28; 95% CI. 0.08—0. 95; P = 0.04). In contrast, tennis players were more at risk of MSPs-12 on shoulders (OR = 3.14; 95% CI. 1.14–8.68; P = 0.02), wrists/hands (OR = 5.18; 95% CI.1.40–11.13; P = 0.01), and hips/thigh (OR = 2.90; 95% CI. 1.1–8.38; P = 0.04). Professionals were protected from MSPs-12 on neck pain with a significant reduction of risk by 61% (OR = 0.39, 95% CI. 0.21–0.75, P = 0.03). Conclusion: MSPs are a reality among athletes and their risk is modulated by sport disciplines, athletic status and gender. © 2023, The Author(s).",Amateurs; Athletes; Musculoskeletal pains; Professionals; Senegal,Athletes; Athletic Injuries; Basketball; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Musculoskeletal Pain; Senegal; adult; amateur athlete; Article; athlete; athletics; backache; basketball; cross-sectional study; female; football; hand pain; hip pain; human; knee pain; low back pain; major clinical study; male; musculoskeletal pain; neck pain; prevalence; professional athlete; risk factor; risk reduction; rugby; Senegal; shoulder pain; sport; tennis; wrestling; wrist pain; athlete; basketball; sport injury,"""Pain Management and Musculoskeletal Health in Various Populations""",Chronic Pain Management and Treatment Studies,Injury Risk and Performance in Athletes

Various methods are employed to quantify asymmetries between limbs. However, limited data is available describing the amount of asymmetry that may be expected during running and no index has been identified as preferable for making a clinical determination of asymmetry. Therefore, this study aimed to describe amounts of asymmetry in collegiate cross-country runners and compare different methods of calculating asymmetry. Research question: What can be expected as a normal amount of asymmetry in biomechanical variables in healthy runners when using different indices to quantify limb symmetry? Methods: Sixty-three (29 male and 34 female) runners participated. Running mechanics were assessed during overground running using 3D motion capture and a musculoskeletal model using static optimization to estimate muscle forces. Independent t-tests were utilized to determine statistical differences in variables between legs. Different methods of quantifying asymmetry were then compared to statistical differences between limbs to determine cut-off values and the sensitivity and specificity of each method. Results: A large portion of runners demonstrated asymmetry during running. Kinematic variables can be expected to have small differences (2–3 degrees) between limbs while muscle forces may show greater amounts of asymmetry. The sensitivities and specificities for each method of calculating asymmetry were similar, however, different methods led to different cut-off values for each variable investigated. Significance: Asymmetry can be expected between limbs during running. However, when assessing asymmetry, practitioners should consider the joint, variable, and method of calculating asymmetry when determining differences between limbs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Biomechanics; Gait analysis; Injury risk; Running,Biomechanical Phenomena; Female; Gait; Humans; Leg; Male; Muscles; Running; adult; Article; biomechanics; clinical assessment; comparative study; female; human; kinematic asymmetry; kinematics; leg; male; model; muscle strength; muscle strength asymmetry; normal human; procedures; receiver operating characteristic; runner; running; sensitivity and specificity; gait; leg; muscle; physiology; running,"""Analysis of Biomechanics, Exercise Techniques, and Physiological Adaptations in Various Physical Activities""",Lower Limb Muscle Strength and Biomechanics Studies,Gender Differences in Musculoskeletal Health & Physical Fitness

The concepts around knee arthroplasty constantly evolving keeping the basics right. Surgeons across the globe are blending established known techniques with newer modifications. The anatomic, functional, and kinematic alignments of the prosthetic knee are frequently debated at conferences. Irrespective of the alignment principle one is following the aim is to achieve a balanced knee for better function. While balancing the knee arthroplasty the basic theme accepted worldwide is the combination of gap balancing and measured resection philosophy. The additional procedures that aid in are these soft tissue releases, lateralization of the prosthesis, reduction osteotomy, and downsizing of the implant which results into a modern current way of approaching the idea of balancing. The surgical workflow I have discussed here is actually the amalgamation of standard teachings and newer trends resulting into the Hybrid integrated technique (H) of balancing a prosthetic a total knee arthroplasty. From the orthopedic trainee point of view it is confusing to see the operating room execution is different than conventional books information. Hence, there is a need to create a beginner’s guide of the current workflow. The modern algorithm helps in balancing the soft tissue releases and bony releases to complement each other. The below-mentioned surgical workflow is not a novel approach but scientifically documenting the current practice implemented by many surgeons at various arthroplasty centers. Hence, it is not a presentation of a personal clinical case study series but an adaptation of various surgical steps to form a workflow. Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Methods: The performances of eighty women ((age, 64.7 ± 3.38 y; body mass, 66.3 ± 11.15 kg; height, 153.5 ± 5.71 cm, BMI, 28.08 ± 4.00 kg/m2) were assessed in the 6-m walk test, timed up and go test, chair stand test, handgrip strength, and unloaded vertical jump. The change of direction velocity (CODv) deficit (m.s−1) was calculated as TUG velocity – 6-m walk velocity. Estimation statistics were adopted, which focus on the effect size of the higher/lower, as opposed to significance testing. The bootstrap with 5000 replicates was used to obtain bias-corrected and accelerated 95% compatibility intervals (CI) of the point estimate of each effect Results: There were large effects between faster older women compared to slower older women in COD velocity (TUG), chair stand test, and CODv deficit. On the other hand, we observed no influence of 6-m walk test performance on vertical jumps or the handgrip strength test. Conclusion: Strength and conditioning coaches and professionals involved with older women should consider the COD deficit (i.e., linear velocity minus change of direction velocity), as a complementary measure to provide an initial idea of the adequate pathway for exercise prescription and to track responses in older women. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Aging; Exercise test; Human physical conditioning; Physical fitness; Physical functional performance,Aged; Exercise Test; Female; Hand Strength; Humans; Muscle Strength; Physical Functional Performance; Postural Balance; Time and Motion Studies; Walk Test; Walking; adult; aging; article; body mass; bootstrapping; chemical oxygen demand; community dwelling person; effect size; exercise; exercise test; female; fitness; grip strength; human; human experiment; physical performance; prescription; timed up and go test; velocity; walk test; walking speed; aged; body equilibrium; exercise test; hand strength; muscle strength; physiology; task performance; walk test; walking,"""Physical Activity and Health Outcomes in Aging Populations""",Physical Activity and Health in Older Adults,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Methods: In this double-blinded and randomized study, 30 participants were randomly assigned into two groups: tDCS combined with FCE and sham combined with FCE (i.e., control group). The participants received 2 mA stimulation for 20 min concurrently with FCE over 4 weeks (i.e., three sessions per week). After the first two groups completed the intervention, a reference group (FCE-only group) was included to further explore the placebo effects of sham by comparing it with the control group. Foot muscle strength, passive ankle kinesthesia, and static balance were assessed at baseline and after the intervention. Results: Compared with the control group and baseline, tDCS combined with FCE could increase toe flexor strength (p < 0.001) and decrease the passive kinesthesia threshold of ankle eversion (p = 0.002). No significant differences in static balance were observed between tDCS + FCE and control groups. The linear regression models showed an association towards significance between the percent changes in metatarsophalangeal joint flexor strength and the anteroposterior average sway velocity of the center of gravity in one-leg standing with eyes closed following tDCS + FCE (r2 = 0.286; p = 0.057). The exploratory analysis also showed that compared with FCE alone, the sham stimulation did not induce any placebo effects during FCE. Conclusion: Participating in 4 weeks of intervention using tDCS in combination with FCE effectively enhances toe flexor strength and foot–ankle sensory function. © 2022, The Author(s).",Foot core exercise; Foot muscle strength; Passive ankle kinesthesia; Static balance; Transcranial direct current stimulation,Exercise Therapy; Humans; Lower Extremity; Postural Balance; Salicylamides; Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation; salicylamide derivative; salicylhydroxamic acid; adult; ankle; article; clinical article; controlled study; double blind procedure; exercise; exploratory research; female; foot muscle; gravity; human; human experiment; kinesthesia; linear regression analysis; male; metatarsophalangeal joint; muscle strength; placebo effect; randomized controlled trial; sensation; sensorimotor function; toe; transcranial direct current stimulation; body equilibrium; kinesiotherapy; lower limb; physiology,"""Effects of Various Interventions on Postural Stability and Balance Control""",Postural Stability and Lower Limb Motor Control Studies,Evaluation and Improvement of Postural Balance and Muscle Strength

Specifically, a quantitative systematic review, known as a meta-analysis, combines results from various studies to address a specific research question. This review serves as a guide on how to: (1) design; (2) perform; and (3) publish an orthopedic arthroplasty systematic review. In Part III, we focus on how to design and perform a meta-analysis. We delineate the advantages and disadvantages of meta-analyses compared to systematic reviews, acknowledging their potential challenges due to time constraints and the complexities posed by study heterogeneity and data availability. Despite these obstacles, a well-executed meta-analysis contributes precision and heightened statistical power, standing at the apex of the evidence-based pyramid. The design of a meta-analysis closely mirrors that of a systematic review, but necessitates the inclusion of effect sizes, variability measures, sample sizes, outcome measures, and overall study characteristics. Effective data presentation involves the use of forest plots, along with analyses for heterogeneities and subgroups. Widely-used software tools are common in this domain, and there is a growing trend toward incorporating artificial intelligence software. Ultimately, the intention is for these papers to act as foundational resources for individuals interested in conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses in the context of orthopaedic arthroplasty, where applicable. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",arthroplasty research; clinical orthopedic research; data analysis; meta-analysis; study design; systematic review,,"""Advancements and Efficacy of Therapies in Orthopedics and Sports Medicine""",Clinical Analysis and Trials in Therapy Treatments,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

However, the comparatively effective surgical intervention with relatively fewer side effects remains unknown. This study aims to fill in this gap by conducting a Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) and provide a theoretical basis for the clinical application. Method and analysis We will perform a Bayesian NMA and will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in English or Chinese that compare surgical intervention (ie, standard ACL reconstruction, ACL remnant-preserving reconstruction and ACL repair with suture augmentation to conservative therapy or studies that compare one surgical intervention to another for the symptom relief and function recovery of patients with ACL rupture. Primary outcome will be the proportion of patients with symptomatic and functional improvement measured by the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score before and 6 months after treatment, with scores ranging from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). Secondary outcomes will be knee-specific quality of life (ACL QoL), return to activity and level of sport participation (Tegner or modified Tegner score), health-related QoL (EuroQol Group 5-Dimension 5-Level, EQ-5D-5L), resource use, intervention-related complications and patient satisfaction. We have developed search strategies for PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library and Web of Science, retrieving RCTs that meet the inclusion criteria from database inception to 1 December 2023. The methodological quality of the included RCTs will be assessed based on the Cochrane risk of bias table. The relative ranking probability of the best intervention will be estimated using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve. The Bayesian NMA will be conducted by using WinBUGS V.1.4.3. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach will be applied to determine our confidence in an overall treatment ranking from the NMA.

It is unknown whether cardiac chronotropic incompetence (CI) during maximal exercise is already present in obese adolescents and, if so, how that relates to cardiometabolic health. Methods: Sixty-nine obese adolescents (body mass index standard deviation score = 2.23 ± 0.32, age = 14.1 ± 1.2 years; mean ± SD) and 29 lean adolescents (body mass index standard deviation score = –0.16 ± 0.84, age = 14.0 ± 1.5 years) performed a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing from which indicators for peak performance were determined. The resting heart rate and peak heart rate were used to calculate the maximal chronotropic response index. Biochemistry (lipid profile, glycemic control, inflammation, and leptin) was studied in fasted blood samples and during an oral glucose tolerance test within obese adolescents. Regression analyses were applied to examine associations between the presence of CI and blood or exercise capacity parameters, respectively, within obese adolescents. Results: CI was prevalent in 32 out of 69 obese adolescents (46%) and 3 out of 29 lean adolescents (10%). C-reactive protein was significantly higher in obese adolescents with CI compared to obese adolescents without CI (p = 0.012). Furthermore, peak oxygen uptake and peak cycling power output were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in obese adolescents with CI vs. obese adolescents without CI. The chronotropic index was independently related to blood total cholesterol (standardized coefficient β = –0.332; p = 0.012) and C-reactive protein concentration (standardized coefficient β = –0.269; p = 0.039). Conclusion: CI is more common in the current cohort of obese adolescents, and is related to systemic inflammation and exercise intolerance. © 2021",Adolescents; Cardiometabolic health; Exercise tolerance; Heart rate; Obesity,Adolescent; Adult; C-Reactive Protein; Cardiovascular Diseases; Child; Exercise Test; Humans; Inflammation; Pediatric Obesity; C reactive protein; glucose; insulin; C reactive protein; adolescent; adolescent obesity; Article; biochemical analysis; blood sampling; body composition; body fat percentage; body height; body mass; body weight; cardiometabolic risk factor; cardiopulmonary exercise test; cardiopulmonary function; cardiovascular risk factor; cholesterol blood level; chronotropism; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diastolic blood pressure; exercise; exercise tolerance; female; glycemic control; greater trochanter; heart rate; hip circumference; homeostasis model assessment; human; inflammation; insulin sensitivity; International Obesity Task Force; lung gas exchange; lung minute volume; major clinical study; male; observational study; oral glucose tolerance test; oxygen consumption; pancreas islet cell function; pediatric hospital; physical activity; resting heart rate; systolic blood pressure; tidal volume; venous blood; waist circumference; waist hip ratio; adult; cardiovascular disease; child; childhood obesity; exercise test; inflammation,"""Effects of Exercise and Lifestyle Modification on Diabetes, Obesity, and Cardiovascular Health""",Effects of Exercise Programs on Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Health Outcomes,Physical Fitness in Children and Adolescents

Whilst guidelines recommend the use of exercise for low back pain, research suggests that no one exercise is superior, creating a question over the mechanism of effect. The patient-practitioner relationship may be important in managing low back pain; however, the relationship between Pilates teachers and clients is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to identify the components of the relationship between Pilates teachers and clients with persistent low back pain, explore key influences on the relationship, and ascertain the nature of the relationship. Method: We conducted a qualitative, ethnographically-informed study at eight sites in the South of England, observing 24 Pilates sessions and interviewing 9 Pilates teachers and 10 clients with persistent low back pain. Fieldnotes and interview transcripts were analysed thematically. Results: The findings demonstrate a complex, multi-faceted interaction that occurs during Pilates sessions, grounded within certain health perceptions, and predicated on expectations of individuality, choice and expertise. A key finding reveals the perceived importance of mastery of prescribed movements with control and precision, in which clients particularly value the authority of the teacher in a directive learning environment. Conclusion: We contend that the role of the Pilates teacher in this study facilitated the alleviation of clients’ distress through the application of ritual-like Pilates activity. We conclude that the relationship between Pilates teachers and clients with persistent low back pain may be considered a therapeutic relationship. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Back pain management; Ethnographic; Low back pain; Pilates exercise; Ritual; Therapeutic relationship; United Kingdom,Ceremonial Behavior; Exercise; Humans; Learning; Low Back Pain; Movement; analgesia; Article; authority; controlled study; decision making; distress syndrome; England; ethnographic research; expectation; female; human; individuality; interview; learning environment; low back pain; major clinical study; male; observational study; perception; pilates; pilot study; practice guideline; professional-patient relationship; qualitative research; ritual; teacher; thematic analysis; exercise; learning; low back pain; movement (physiology); symbolism,"""Pain Management and Musculoskeletal Health in Various Populations""",Chronic Pain Management and Treatment Studies,Management and Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

Outside-in meniscal repair is one of the techniques advocated for the management of traumatic meniscal tears. This systematic review investigated the outcomes of the outside-in repair technique for the management of traumatic tears of the menisci. The outcomes of interest were to investigate whether PROMs improved and to evaluate the rate of complications. Methods: Following the 2020 PRISMA statement, in May 2023, PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Embase were accessed with no time constraints. All the clinical investigations which reported data on meniscal repair using the outside-in technique were considered for inclusion. Only studies which reported data on acute traumatic meniscal tears in adults were considered. Only studies which reported a minimum of 24 months of follow-up were eligible. Results: Data from 458 patients were extracted. 34% (155 of 458) were women. 65% (297 of 458) of tears involved the medial meniscus. The mean operative time was 52.9 ± 13.6 min. Patients returned to their normal activities at 4.8 ± 0.8 months. At a mean of 67-month follow-up, all PROMs of interest improved: Tegner scale (P = 0.003), Lysholm score (P < 0.0001), International Knee Documentation Committee (P < 0.0001). 5.9% (27 of 458) of repairs were considered failures. Four of 186 (2.2%) patients experienced a re-injury, and 5 of 458 (1.1%) patients required re-operation.

Therefore, ISO intake may affect anaerobic power output after prolonged endurance exercise. This study aimed to clarify the time course of CHO utilization during endurance exercise after a single intake of ISO or sucrose (SUC) and the anaerobic power output at the end of endurance exercise. Methods: After an intake of either ISO or SUC, 13 athletes were kept at rest for 60 min. Thereafter, they performed a 90-min of treadmill running at their individual target level of % (Formula presented.) max. During the experimental session, the expired gas was recorded, and the energy expenditure (EE) and CHO oxidation rate were estimated. Immediately after 90 min of running, a 30-s Wingate test was performed, and the maximal anaerobic power output was compared between the ISO and SUC conditions. Results: The percentage of CHO-derived EE increased rapidly after CHO intake and then decreased gradually throughout the experiment. The slopes of the regression lines calculated from the time course in the CHO-derived EE were significantly (negatively) larger in the SUC condition (-19.4 ± 9.6 [%/h]) than in the ISO condition (-13.3 ± 7.5 [%/h]). Furthermore, the maximal power output in the Wingate test immediately after the endurance exercise was significantly higher in the ISO condition than in the SUC condition (peak power: 12.0 ± 0.6 vs. 11.5 ± 0.9 [W/kg]). Conclusion: Compared with SUC intake, ISO intake does not produce an abrupt decline in the percentage of CHO-derived EE during prolonged endurance exercise; it remains relatively high until the final exercise phase. Additionally, anaerobic power output at the end of the exercise, largely contributed by anaerobic glycolysis, was greater after ISO intake than after SUC intake. © 2023, The Author(s).",Anaerobic power output; Carbohydrate oxidation; Endurance exercise; Energy expenditure; Isomaltulose,carbohydrate; palatinose; sucrose; anaerobic glycolysis; Article; athlete; controlled study; endurance training; energy expenditure; exercise; human; oxidation reduction reaction; running; sugar intake; treadmill exercise,"""Effects of Different Factors on Muscle Performance and Metabolism""",Exercise and Muscle Performance in Different Individuals,Effects of Exercise and Supplementation on Performance and Health

Seventy recreational runners (30 ± 7.3 years old, 40% female) were randomised to a barefoot running group (BAR), a group wearing a digital metronome with their basal cadence increased by 10% (CAD), and a control group (CON). BAR and CAD groups included intervals from 15 to 40 min over 10 weeks and 3 days/week. 3D sagittal kinematics of the ankle, knee, hip, pelvis, and trunk were measured before and after the retraining program, at comfortable and high speeds. A 3 × 2 mixed ANOVA revealed that BAR and CAD groups increased knee and hip flexion at footstrike, increased peak hip flexion during stance and flight phase, decreased peak hip extension during flight phase, and increased anterior pelvic tilt at both speeds after retraining.

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy is used to treat myalgia and holds the potential to manage other types of muscle pain and fatigue. We aimed to compare the efficacy of extracorporeal shock wave therapy and cold therapy in treating myalgia and dysphoria caused by delayed-onset muscle soreness. METHODS: This study was conducted at the Department of Rehabilitation of Shenzhen University General Hospital (Shenzhen, China). Fifty-eight participants exhibiting symptoms of delayed-onset muscle soreness were included. Participants were randomly assigned to the extracorporeal shock wave treatment group (N.=29) or cold therapy group (N.=29). The Visual Analogue Scale and rating of perceived exertion were used to assess the participants before, immediately after, and 24 hours after treatment. The main outcome measures were the Visual Analogue Scale, minimum clinically important difference in pain relief >1.4, and rating of perceived exertion scores. RESULTS: Immediately after treatment, the Visual Analogue Scale and rating of perceived exertion scores were lower in the extracorporeal shock wave group than in the cold therapy group. The total symptom duration was similar between the two groups. Twenty-one participants treated with shock waves and 13 participants receiving cold therapy achieved the minimum clinically important difference immediately after treatment; 16 and 17 participants, respectively, achieved the minimum clinically important difference 24 hours later. CONCLUSIONS: A single shock wave treatment provided better immediate pain relief than did cold therapy; however, the effect was short-lived and did not shorten the condition course. © 2022 Edizioni Minerva Medica.

Previous studies have examined variables associated with sedentary time to inform behavior change programs; however, these studies have lacked data sets that encompass potentially important domains. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to build a more comprehensive model containing previously theorized important predictors of sedentary time and new predictors that have not been explored. We hypothesized that variables representing the domains of physical capacity, psychosocial, physical health, cognition, and environmental would be significantly related to sedentary time in individuals post-stroke. Methods: This was a cross-sectional analysis of 280 individuals with chronic stroke. An activity monitor was used to measure sedentary (i.e. non-stepping) time. Five domains (8 predictors) were entered into a sequential linear regression model: physical capacity (6-Minute Walk Test, assistive device use), psychosocial (Activities Specific Balance Confidence Scale and Patient Health Questionnaire-9), physical health (Charlson Comorbidity Index and body mass index), cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment), and environmental (Area Deprivation Index). Results: The 6-Minute Walk Test (β = −0.39, p < .001), assistive device use (β = 0.15, p = .03), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (β = 0.16, p = .01), and body mass index (β = 0.11, p = .04) were significantly related to non-stepping time in individuals with chronic stroke. The model explained 28.5% of the variability in non-stepping time. Conclusions: This work provides new perspective on which variables may need to be addressed in programs targeting sedentary time in stroke. Such programs should consider physical capacity, depressive symptoms, and physical health. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",behavior change; depression; physical activity; sedentary; Stroke; walking,"Brain Damage, Chronic; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Stroke; Stroke Rehabilitation; Walking; activities-specific balance confidence; aged; Article; body mass; cerebrovascular accident; Charlson Comorbidity Index; chronic disease; cognition; cross-sectional study; environmental factor; female; health; human; major clinical study; male; Montreal cognitive assessment; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; physical capacity; predictive model; predictor variable; sedentary time; six minute walk test; social psychology; chronic brain disease; psychology; stroke rehabilitation; walking","""Physical Activity and Rehabilitation in Adults with Neurological Conditions""",Physical Activity and Rehabilitation Post-Injury,Physical Activity Engagement Barriers and Facilitators for Stroke Survivors

However, it is not clear whether sports practice in childhood and adolescence could be inversely related to CRF in adult life. Objectives: This study aimed to analyze the association between early sports practice and cardiovascular risk factors in a randomized sample of community-dwelling adults. Methods: For this, 265 adults aged ≥ 18 years composed the sample. Cardiovascular risk factors of obesity, central obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension were collected. Early sports practice was retrospectively self-reported using an appropriate instrument. Total physical activity level was assessed by accelerometry. The association between early sports practice and cardiovascular risk factors in adulthood was analyzed by binary logistic regression, adjusted for sex, age, socioeconomic status, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Results: Early sports practice was observed in 56.2% of the sample. The prevalence of central obesity (31.5 vs. 50.0%; p = 0.003), diabetes (4.7% vs. 13.7%; p = 0.014), dyslipidemia (10.7% vs. 24.1%; p = 0.005), and hypertension (14.1% vs. 34.5%; p = 0.001) was lower in participants who reported early sports practice. Participants who reported early sports practice in childhood and adolescence were, respectively, 60% (OR = 0.40; 95% CI 0.19–0.82) and 59% (OR = 0.41; 95% CI 0.21–0.82) less likely to have hypertension in adult life when compared to those with no early sports practice, independently of sex, age, socioeconomic status, and habitual physical activity level in adulthood.

Interview data were analyzed using the thematic framework method. Six themes were identified: (1) personal experiences with aging influence perceptions of RT; (2) physical and emotional consequences of AEs limit activities and define future RT participation; (3) injury recovery defines the severity of AE; (4) health conditions influence the perceived risks and benefits of participating in RT; (5) RT setting and trained supervision influence exercise behaviors and risk perceptions; and (6) experiencing a previous AE influences future exercise behavior. Despite participant awareness of the value and benefits of RT in both the context of aging and chronic health conditions, there is concern about experiencing exercise-related AEs. The perceived risks of RT influenced the participants’ decision to engage or return to RT. Consequently, to promote RT participation, the risks, not just the benefits, should be properly reported in future studies, translated, and disseminated to the public. © 2023, Canadian Science Publishing.

Purpose: To report minimum 5-year outcomes after primary arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of MRCT and determine whether age affects outcomes. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence 4. Methods: The study included consecutive patients with MRCTs who were treated with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair by a single surgeon between February 2006 and October 2016. MRCTs were defined as ≥2 affected tendons with tendon retraction to the glenoid rim and/or a minimum exposed greater tuberosity of ≥67. Patient-reported outcome (PRO) data collected preoperatively and at a minimum of 5 years included the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score; Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) score; the shortened version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score (QuickDASH); the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) Physical Component Summary (PCS); and patient satisfaction. Surgical failure was defined as subsequent revision rotator cuff surgery or conversion to reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. Regression analysis was performed to determine whether age had an effect on clinical outcomes. Results: A total of 53 shoulders in 51 patients (mean age, 59.7 years; range, 39.6-73.8 years; 34 male, 19 female) met inclusion criteria with a mean follow-up of 8.1 years (range, 5.0-12.1 years). Three shoulders (5.7%) failed at 2.4, 6.0, and 7.1 years. Minimum 5-year follow-up was obtained in 45 of the remaining 50 shoulders (90%). Mean PROs improved as follows: ASES from 58.8 to 96.9 (P <.001), SANE from 60.5 to 88.5 (P <.001), QuickDASH from 34.2 to 6.8 (P <.001), and SF-12 PCS from 41.1 to 52.2 (P <.001). Patient satisfaction was a median of 10 (on a scale of 1-10). Age was not associated with any PRO measures postoperatively (P >.05). Conclusion: This study demonstrated significantly improved clinical scores, decreased pain, and increased return to activity for patients with MRCT at midterm follow-up (mean, 8.1 years; range, 5.0-12.1 years).

Repeated trauma to the mandible can lead to inflammatory responses in the masticatory muscles, laxity of the ligaments, and internal disorders. In this study, we aimed to examine the incidence of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) in athletes who perform defensive sports and the symptoms that may occur. We also aimed to compare the data we obtained with individuals who did not do sports. Material and Method: Male individuals between the ages of 18-31 who applied to our clinic and were engaged in defense sports such as boxing, kickboxing, and karate for at least 5 years were included in the study group. (n=30) The control group was chosen among healthy individuals in the same age group who had never been involved in sports. (n=30) Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire consisting of demographic information, anamnesis information, and TMD symptoms. Clinical examinations were performed intraorally and extraorally. In addition, clinical examination of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) was performed following the Axis I assessment and examination instructions reported in the research diagnostic criteria for temporomandibular disorders (RDC/TMD), and those with TMD symptoms were recorded. Results: In the athletes participating in our study, symptoms such as deviation during mouth opening, pain in the TMJ capsule and masticatory muscles, and hypermobility; were higher than the participants in the control group. TMD was diagnosed in 60% of the athletes and 23.3% of the control group. Conclusion: In order to prevent TMJ complications in athletes who perform defensive sports and to detect clinical signs of TMJ micro-macro trauma, athletes should be routinely examined, personalized mouthguards should be recommended, and awareness should be raised in terms of protecting TMJ health. © 2023, Nobelmedicus.

The objective of the study was to analyze the efficacy and safety of this treatment in symptomatic primary knee osteoarthritis (OA). Methods: This observational, prospective, multicenter, single-cohort study involved 166 patients with knee OA treated with a single-shot of Pronolis®HD mono 2.5% and followed up as many as 24 weeks. Results: Compared with baseline, the score of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale reduced at the 12-week visit (primary endpoint, median: 9 interquartile range [IQR]: 7–11 versus median: 4; IQR: 2–6; p < 0.001). The percentage of patients achieving > 50% improvement in the pain subscale increased progressively from 37.9% (at 2 weeks) to 66.0% (at 24 weeks). Similarly, WOMAC scores for pain on walking, stiffness subscale, and functional capacity subscale showed significant reductions at the 12-week visit which were maintained up to the 24-week visit. The EuroQol visual analog scale score increased after 12 weeks (median: 60 versus 70). The need for rescue medication (analgesics/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) also decreased in all post-injection visits. Three patients (1.6%) reported local adverse events (joint swelling) of mild intensity.

Sprint interval training on stationary air bike elicits cardiorespiratory adaptations while being time-efficient. J Strength Cond Res 37(9): 1795-1801, 2023-Sprint interval training (SIT) refers to a set of brief intermittent exercises that are performed at maximal intensity. This study compared the effects of 2 SIT protocols (e.g., 10-5-SIT and 20-10-SIT) vs. moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) on cardiovascular adaptations, using stationary air bikes. Thirty-Two recreationally active individuals were randomly assigned to the 3 performance groups, such as 10-5-SIT (n = 11), 20-10-SIT (n = 10), and MICT (n = 11), to train 3 days per week for 4 weeks. Moderate-intensity continuous training included 30 minutes of cycling at 75% of maximal heart rate reserve, whereas the SIT protocols consisted of 3 sets of 8 intervals at all-out intensity. The 10-5-SIT and 20-10-SIT were performed with 10-second work:5-second rest and 20-second work:10-second rest, with 2.5-and 5-minute recovery periods between sets, respectively. A ramp protocol was used before and after the intervention via cycle ergometer to assess aerobic performance. Time to exhaustion (TTE), absolute Vo2max (A-Vo2max), relative Vo2max (R-Vo2max), and metabolic equivalents (METs) were measured and analyzed with 2-way mixed factorial analyses of variance (ANOVAs). In addition, total work (TW) during 12 sessions were recorded and analyzed with 1-way ANOVA. Significant (p < 0.05) differences were found for TW (10-5-SIT: 907.3 ± 332.0, 20-10-SIT: 1230.0 ± 188.1, and MICT: 2263.0 ± 896.9 calories) between groups. A significant main effect of time was observed for 10-5-SIT, 20-10-SIT, and MICT (p < 0.05) in TTE (increased by 7.3, 8.7, and 8.2%), A-Vo2max (increased by 13.0, 11.8, and 13.6%), R-Vo2max (increased by 12.6, 12.1, and 14.8%), and METs (increased by 12.7, 12.3, and 14.9%), respectively. Despite less volume and duration, both SIT protocols induced cardiorespiratory adaptations similar to MICT. These findings suggest that performing SIT on a stationary air bike is valuable because of time-efficiency and cardiorespiratory adaptations. © 2023 NSCA National Strength and Conditioning Association.

The three MMQ subscale (Satisfaction, Ability, and Strategy) was administered twice, with a 3-month interval. The test-retest reliability was examined using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). The random measurement error was examined by calculating the standard error of measurement (SEM) and minimal detectable change (MDC95). The test-retest reliabilities of the three MMQ subscales were generally acceptable. The SEM of the three MMQ subscales was higher than the acceptable criterion of 10%. Despite the influence of random measurement error, the change scores of the three MMQ subscales may represent true changes if they are larger than the MDC95 of 13.2 (Satisfaction), 18.4 (Ability), and 16.9 (Strategy).

The objective was to compare muscle activity between and within muscles during the NHE to add insights in its underlying protective mechanism. Through multichannel electromyography, we measured muscle activity in male basketball players during the NHE. Electromyography was assessed at 15 locations: 5 for biceps femoris long head, 4 for semitendinosus, and 6 for semimembranosus. For each percent of the eccentric phase of the NHE, muscle activity was calculated for each electrode location within each hamstring muscle individually. To quantify whole muscle head activity, means and variances across electrodes within each muscle were calculated. Thirty-five noninjured participants were included (mean age, 18 [2] y; mass, 87 [12] kg; height, 192 [9] cm). Heterogeneous muscle activity was found between 38% and 62% and over the whole eccentric contraction phase within the semitendinosus and the semimembranosus, respectively. Muscle activity of the semitendinosus was significantly higher than that of the biceps femoris long head. During the NHE, the relative contribution of the semitendinosus is the highest among hamstring muscles. Its strong contribution may compensate for the biceps femoris long head, the most commonly injured hamstring muscle head. © 2023 Human Kinetics, Inc.",injury prevention; load sharing; muscle function; muscle strain injury,Adolescent; Electromyography; Exercise; Hamstring Muscles; Humans; Male; Muscle Strength; Electrodes; Activity distribution; Biceps femoris; Injury prevention; Load sharing; Multichannel surface electromyographies; Muscle activities; Muscle function; Muscle strain; Muscle strain injury; Strain injuries; accident prevention; adult; Article; biceps femoris muscle; clinical article; controlled study; diffusion tensor imaging; eccentric muscle contraction; hamstring muscle; head muscle; human; human experiment; male; multichannel surface electromyography; muscle contraction; muscle exercise; muscle function; muscle isometric contraction; muscle mass; muscle strain; post hoc analysis; semitendinous muscle; surface electromyography; adolescent; electromyography; exercise; muscle strength; physiology; Muscle,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Muscle Strength and Recovery in Sports Performance

This situation may lead to an asymmetry of spinal segments, which in turn may correlate with muscle contractions around the lumbopelvic area and can lead to musculoskeletal pelvic girdle pain. The aim of this study was to investigate the segmental mobility of the vertebral column in two groups of musicians, those with and without pelvic girdle pain. METHODS: This study included 45 musicians who played their instrument for at least 10 years. Musicians were divided into two groups depending on if they had pelvic girdle pain or not. Spinal mobility was evaluated by a hand-held computer-assisted device called the Spinal Mouse® system, and pelvic girdle pain assessments were evaluated using orthopedic tests including the active straight leg raise (ASLR), flexion abduction external rotation (FABER), pelvic pain provocation (P4), and long dorsal ligament palpation (LDL). RESULTS: The current study found no significant differences in the thoracic, lumbar, and sacral curves in the trunk flexion tests between musicians with and without pelvic girdle pain (p=0.28, 0.54, and 0.63). However, analysis of spinal mobility revealed that musicians with pelvic pain had significant limitations of spinal flexion mobility, mainly in the thoracolumbar region in the sagittal plane (p=0.02 and 0.01). CONCLUSİONS: This study revealed a significant correlation between pelvic girdle pain and limitations of segmental spinal flexion mainly in the thoracolumbar region of the sagittal plane in musicians. A lack of spinal mobility appears to be prevalent among musicians with pelvic girdle pain. © 2023 Science and Medicine.",,Animals; Humans; Mice; Musculoskeletal Pain; Pelvic Girdle Pain; Pelvic Pain; Social Group; Spine; abduction; Article; body height; body mass; body weight; clinical article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; descriptive research; female; human; kyphosis; lordosis; male; musculoskeletal pain; musician; palpation; pelvic girdle pain; pelvic pain; physical examination; questionnaire; sitting; spine mobility; standing; animal; mouse; musculoskeletal pain; spine,"""Balance, Mobility, and Fall Risks in Aging and Musculoskeletal Conditions""",Impact and Control of Chronic Low Back Pain and Balance in Older Adults,Management and Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

We conducted a double-blind, randomized, counter-balanced, and crossover research study to examine the effects of low caffeinated energy drink (Low ED) or high caffeinated energy drink (High ED) supplement on the performance, haematological response, and oxidative stress in triathletes. Twelve male participants underwent three testing sessions separated by weekly intervals, consisting of sprint triathlon training (0.75 km swim, 20 km cycle, and 5 km run). Before and during the trials, participants were randomly provided with either placebo (PLA) group, Low ED group, or High ED group. Exercise performance in the High ED group decreased significantly compared with the PLA and Low ED groups (p < 0.05). However, participants in the Low ED group also experienced an improved performance (p = 0.054). Analysis of variance revealed no differences among the three groups in cortisol and testosterone levels, or the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion score (p > 0.5). Furthermore, superoxide dismutase (SOD) was reduced with exercise and were lowest in the High ED group. However, compared with PLA, a significant decrease of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) was observed in Low ED and High ED groups (p < 0.05). This indicates that caffeinated energy drink consumption may improve performance and reduce oxidative stress in sprint triathlon athletes. However, individual differences should be considered when supplementing with caffeinated energy drinks to decrease side effects.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of McConnell taping (MT) and Kinesio taping (KT) on kinematic variables when patients with PFPS descend stairs. METHODS: Fifty PFPS patients were randomly assigned to either the MT group or the KT group. Pain and lower extremities joint angles were measured while descending stairs before and after the intervention. All outcomes measured were analyzed using either paired t tests or independent t tests to compare the difference within or between groups, respectively. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference in both groups in anterior knee pain scale score (p< 0.05). As a result of analysis of lower extremities joint angles at initial contact, loading response, and terminal stance, there were statistically significant within-group differences in hip, knee flexion, abduction and lateral rotation angles in both groups (p< 0.05). There were statistically significant within-group differences in hip flexion, knee flexion, and dorsiflexion angles in pre-swing (p< 0.05). There was a statistically significant difference between the groups in the following events: (1) knee lateral rotation angle at initial contact; (2) hip flexion angle at loading response; (3) and hip flexion at terminal stance angle (p< 0.05). CONCLUSION: MT and KT were effective in lowering knee pain and improving lower extremities joint angle when patients with PFPS descend stairs. In the comparison between the groups, the MT group showed significantly reduced anterior knee pain and increased range of motion of the lower extremities joint compared to the KT group.  © 2023 - IOS Press.

In addition, the effects of knee flexion and rotation on the PMMR are not well understood biomechanically because of technological testing limitations. A novel multiaxial force sensor has made it possible to elucidate answers to these questions. Purpose: (1) To determine if increased posterior tibial slope results in increased posterior shear force and compression on the PMMR, (2) to evaluate how knee flexion angle affects PMMR forces, and (3) to assess how internal and external rotation affects force at the PMMR. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Ten fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were tested in all combinations of 3 posterior tibial slopes and 4 flexion angles. A multiaxial force sensor was connected to the PMMR and installed below the posterior tibial plateau maintaining anatomic position. The specimen underwent a 500-N compression load followed by a 5-N·m internal torque and a 5-N·m external torque. The magnitude and direction of the forces acting on the PMMR were measured. Results: Under joint compression, an increased tibial slope significantly reduced the tension on the PMMR between 5° and 10° (from 13.5 N to 6.4 N), after which it transitioned to a significant increase in PMMR compression, reaching 7.6 N at 15°. Under internal torque, increased tibial slope resulted in 4.7 N of posterior shear at 5° significantly changed to 2.0 N of anterior shear at 10° and then 8.2 N of anterior shear at 15°. Under external torque, increased tibial slope significantly decreased PMMR compression (5°: 8.9 N; 10°: 4.3 N; 15°: 1.1 N). Under joint compression, increased flexion angle significantly increased medial shear forces of the PMMR (0°, 3.8 N; 30°, 6.2 N; 60°, 7.3 N; 90°, 8.4 N). Under internal torque, 90° of flexion significantly increased PMMR tension from 2.3 N to 7.5 N. Under external torque, 30° of flexion significantly increased PMMR compression from 4.7 N to 12.2 N. Conclusion: An increased posterior tibial slope affects compression and anterior shear forces at the PMMR. An increased flexion angle affects compression, tension, and medial shear forces at the PMMR. Clinical Relevance: The increase in compression and posterior shear force when the knee is loaded in compression may place the PMMR under increased stress and risk potential failure after repair. This study provides clinicians with information to create safer protocols and improve repair techniques to minimize the forces experienced at the PMMR. © 2023 The Author(s).",meniscal biomechanics; meniscotibial ligament; meniscus root forces; meniscus root repair; posterior tibial slope,"Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cadaver; Humans; Knee Joint; Menisci, Tibial; Range of Motion, Articular; Tibia; anterior cruciate ligament injury; biomechanics; cadaver; human; knee; knee meniscus; range of motion; tibia","""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Advancements and Outcomes of Knee Arthroplasty and Rehabilitation Techniques

Methods: Patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with HTA at our institution were identified through electronic health records. Preoperative MRI tendon measurements of the patellar tendon (PT) length, PT width, PT thickness, quadriceps tendon thickness, semitendinosus tendon (ST) cross-sectional area (CSA), and gracilis tendon (GT) CSA were conducted by 2 independent evaluators using digital imaging measurement tools. Results: A total of 53 patients met the inclusion criteria, with a mean HTA diameter of 7.98 ± 0.7 mm. Height greater than 1.63 m, weight greater than 63.4 kg, PT length greater than 4.2 cm, PT thickness greater than 0.33 cm, ST CSA greater than 10.8 mm2, and GT CSA greater than 6.3 mm2 were associated with an HTA of 8 mm or greater (P < .005). Female sex was associated with an HTA of less than 8 mm (P < .05). PT length, PT thickness, and GT CSA were the strongest predictors of an HTA of 8 mm or greater and were combined into an additive logistic regression model: Score = –23.24 + (1.68 × PT length) + (20.104 × PT thickness) + (1.48 × GT CSA). If the score was greater than 0.237, the HTA graft diameter was predicted to be 8 mm or greater with 83% specificity, 91% sensitivity, and 87% accuracy. Conclusions: By combining PT length and PT thickness measurements with GT CSA measurements in a logit function model, we were able to show improved overall specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of estimated HTA diameters in our data set when compared with assessments of anthropometric, ST CSA, GT CSA, or combined ST-GT CSA measurements in isolation. Clinical Relevance: Preoperative MRI measurements may be used to screen whether a patient is likely to have an 8-mm graft in the setting of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with HTA and thus may help guide graft choice. © 2022",,adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; article; controlled study; digital imaging; electronic health record; female; hamstring tendon; human; major clinical study; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patellar ligament; preoperative evaluation; quadriceps tendon; semitendinous muscle; sensitivity and specificity; tendon graft; thickness,"""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction and Outcome Factors

To what extent does musculoskeletal impairment occur (i.e., muscle mass, quality and function) in patients with end stage liver disease (ESLD) by comparison to a healthy age/sex-matched control group? What is the main finding and its importance? Muscle mass, quality and function are impaired in patients with ESLD (compared to age/sex matched controls). Importantly, greater impairments were seen in lower limb compared to arm and trunk muscle groups. These findings may suggest that there should be greater consideration of muscle health in functionally relevant lower limb muscle groups. Abstract: Sarcopenia is associated with reduced quality of life and increased mortality in patients with end stage liver disease (ESLD). Historically, sarcopenia identification in ESLD utilised L3 skeletal muscle index (SMI). There are few data on muscle quality and function within lower limb muscle groups with high functional relevance. The aim of this prospective case–control study was to evaluate the quadriceps muscle in patients with ESLD. Muscle mass and quality were evaluated using MRI (quadriceps anatomical cross sectional area (ACSA), quadriceps volume index, L3 SMI, quadriceps intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT)), mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC) and ultrasonography (vastus lateralis (VL) thickness and quadriceps ACSA). Muscle strength/function was assessed by handgrip strength, peak quadriceps isokinetic torque and chair rise time. Thirty-nine patients with ESLD (55 years, 61% male, 48% alcoholic related liver disease (ArLD), 71% Child–Pugh B/C) and 18 age/sex-matched healthy control participants (HC) were studied. Quadriceps mass was significantly reduced in ESLD versus HC (−17%), but L3 SMI and MAMC were unchanged. Quadriceps IMAT percentage was increased in ESLD (+103%). Handgrip strength (−15%), peak isokinetic torque (−29%), and chair rise time (+56%) were impaired in ESLD. Ultrasound measures of VL thickness (r = 0.56, r = 0.57, r = 0.42) and quadriceps ACSA (r = 0.98, r = 0.86, r = 0.67) correlated to MRI quadriceps ACSA, quadriceps volume and L3 SMI, respectively. Quadriceps muscle mass, quality, and function were impaired in patients with ESLD, whereas conventional assessments of muscle (L3 SMI and MAMC) highlighted no differences between ESLD and HC. Full evaluation of lower limb muscle health is essential in ESLD in order to accurately assess sarcopenia and target future interventions. © 2023 The Authors.

Clinical assessments traditionally were the foundation of concussion diagnoses. However, their subjective nature prompted an exploration of neuroimaging modalities to enhance diagnosis and management. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy provides information about metabolic changes and alterations in the absence of structural abnormalities. Diffusion tensor imaging uncovers microstructural changes in white matter. Functional magnetic resonance imaging assesses neuronal activity to reveal changes in cognitive and sensorimotor functions. Positron emission tomography can assess metabolic disturbances using radiotracers, offering insight into the long-term effects of concussions. Vestibulo-ocular dysfunction screening and eye tracking assess vestibular and oculomotor function. Although these neuroimaging techniques demonstrate promise, continued research and standardization are needed before they can be integrated into the clinical setting. This review emphasizes the potential for neuroimaging in enhancing the accuracy of concussion diagnosis and guiding RTP decisions. © 2024 Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc..

The aim of the present study was to i) determine the feasibility of and adherence to our monitoring approach, and ii) identify variables associated with up-coming illness and injury. We incorporated a comprehensive set of monitoring tools consisting of external load and physical fitness data, questionnaires, blood, neuromuscular-, hamstring, hip abductor and hip adductor performance tests performed over a three-month period in elite under-18 academy soccer players. Twenty-five players (age: 16.6 ± 0.9 years, height: 178 ± 7 cm, weight: 74 ± 7 kg, VO2max: 59 ± 4 ml/min/kg) took part in the study. In addition to evaluating adherence to the monitoring approach, data were analyzed using a linear support vector machine (SVM) to predict illness and injuries. The approach was feasible, with no injuries or dropouts due to the monitoring pro-cess. Questionnaire adherence was high at the beginning and de-creased steadily towards the end of the study. An SVM resulted in the best classification results for three classification tasks, i.e., illness prediction, illness determination and injury prediction. For injury prediction, one of four injuries present in the test data set was detected, with 96.3% of all data points (i.e., injuries and non-injuries) correctly detected. For both illness prediction and deter-mination, there was only one illness in the test data set that was detected by the linear SVM. However, the model showed low pre-cision for injury and illness prediction with a considerable num-ber of false-positives. The results demonstrate the feasibility of a holistic monitoring approach with the possibility of predicting illness and injury. Additional data points are needed to improve the prediction models. In practical application, this may lead to over-cautious recommendations on when players should be protected from injury and illness. © 2023, Journal of Sport Science and Medicine.

We assessed the acceptability and preliminary effectiveness of a theory-driven, group-based dance intervention for BCS delivered in Bogotá, Colombia. Methods: We conducted a quasi-experimental study employing a mixed-methods approach to assess the 8-week, 3 times/week group dance intervention. The effect of the intervention on participants’ physical activity levels (measured by accelerometry), motivation to engage in physical activity, and quality of life were evaluated using generalized estimating equation analysis. The qualitative method included semi-structured interviews thematically analyzed to evaluate program acceptability. Results: Sixty-four BCS were allocated to the intervention (n = 31) or the control groups (n = 33). In the intervention arm, 84% attended ≥ 60% of sessions. We found increases on average minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day (intervention: +8.99 vs control: −3.7 min), and in ratings of motivation (intervention change score = 0.45, vs. control change score= −0.05). BCS reported improvements in perceived behavioral capabilities to be active, captured through the interviews. Conclusions: The high attendance, behavioral changes, and successful delivery indicate the potential effectiveness, feasibility, and scalability of the intervention for BCS in Colombia.

Effects of experimental pain on cervical spine reposition errors were unknown; thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of experimental pain on cervical spine reposition errors. Methods: A repeated measured study design was applied. Thirty healthy subjects (12 males) were recruited. Reposition errors were extracted from upright cervical positions before and after cervical flexion movement in healthy subjects before and during experimental neck pain. Cervical spine reposition errors were calculated based on anatomical landmarks of each cervical joint. Reposition errors were extracted in degrees as constant errors and absolute errors for further statistical analysis. Repeated measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) was applied to analyse experimental pain effects on either constant errors or absolute errors of different cervical joints. Results: The cervical spine showed non-significant difference in reposition errors regarding the constant errors (P>0.05) while larger reposition errors regarding the absolute errors during experimental pain compared to before experimental pain (P<0.001). In addition, the pain level joint (C4/C5) and its adjacent joints (C3/C4 and C5/C6) indicated larger reposition errors regarding absolute errors (P=0.035, P=0.329 and P=0.103, respectively). Conclusions: This study firstly investigated the cervical spine reposition errors in experimental neck pain and further found the joints adjacent to the pain level showed larger errors compared to the distant joints regarding absolute errors. It may imply that the larger reposition errors in specific cervical joint indicate probable injury or pain existed adjacent to the joints. © 2022, The Author(s).",Cervical joint reposition; Cervical spine; Experimental pain; Reposition errors; Spine,"Cervical Vertebrae; Humans; Male; Movement; Neck; Neck Pain; Range of Motion, Articular; adult; analysis of variance; analytical error; anatomical location; Article; body position; cervical spine; cervical spine reposition error; controlled study; experimental pain; female; human; human experiment; male; musculoskeletal function; myalgia; neck pain; normal human; cervical vertebra; joint characteristics and functions; movement (physiology); neck; neck pain","""Balance, Mobility, and Fall Risks in Aging and Musculoskeletal Conditions""",Impact and Control of Chronic Low Back Pain and Balance in Older Adults,Management and Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is a pathological condition of the knee, typical of young adults, characterized by diffuse pain in the anterior and / or medial part of the knee. We aimed to examine the effectiveness of the two types of taping in association with therapeutic exercise in relation to the biomechanical parameters, on pain and on functionality of the lower limb in patients with PFPS. Methods. We collected data from patients treated in our outpatient’s clinic with two kinds of bandage: the Kinesiotaping group (KG) and the McConnel taping group (MG). All subjects were evaluated trough an optoelectronic system, the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), and with the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) at baseline before applying the taping (T0), fifteen minutes after applying the bandage (T1), after four weeks of treatment (T2) without applying the bandage and three months after the end of the first treatment period with bandages and exercises (T3). Results. Thirty-five patients (KG 16; MG 19) were included in the study. The most statistically significant changes over time in the LEFS and NPRS values have been recorded in the MG group compared to KG. The average speed and hip rotation showed a statistically significant increase between T3 and T0. Conclusion. The application of the knee bandage for PFPS would appear to show improvement in NPRS and LEFS outcomes in both groups. Furthermore, in this study the MG evidenced better results and significant changes over time than KG. © 2023 Società Editrice Universo (SEU)",Biomechanics; Knee; Patellofemoral syndrome; Rehabilitation; Taping,Athletic Tape; Biomechanical Phenomena; Exercise; Humans; Pain; Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome; Young Adult; adult; Article; biomechanics; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; clinical feature; clinical trial; exercise; female; functional status; gait; human; kinesio taping; Lower Extremity Functional Scale; male; McConnell taping; numeric rating scale; outpatient; patellofemoral pain syndrome; risk factor; treatment outcome; biomechanics; exercise; pain; young adult,"""Application of Machine Learning and Biomechanics in Musculoskeletal Health and Wearable Devices""","Knee Assessment and Recovery: Validity, Reliability, and Clinical Trials",Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation in Osteoarthritis Patients

It is unknown how these variables relate in populations with different etiologies but similar pain provocation mechanisms. Objective: To compare kinesiophobia, pain catastrophizing, and disability between these two groups. Methods: Patients with CLBP and those with AT were included. Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK-17) and Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS-13) were evaluated in both groups. The CLBP group completed the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and the AT group completed the PROMIS-29 questionnaire. Gait speed was calculated for each group. Disability outcomes were normalized between groups. Results: 119 patients in the CLBP group (64 female, 46 ± 8 years) and 83 patients in the AT group (42 female, 48 ± 12 years) were included. Both groups (CLBP, AT) presented with high prevalence of kinesiophobia (67%, 55%) but the CLBP group presented with higher prevalence of pain catastrophizing (22%, 2%). The CLBP group demonstrated higher levels of disability via normalized ODI (MD= 12.4, 95% CI: 9.2, 15.5) but the AT group demonstrated slower gait speed (MD= 0.1 m/s, 95% CI: 0.0, 0.2). Conclusion: Similarly high prevalence of kinesiophobia was found in patients with CLBP and patients with AT. While the CLBP group reported greater prevalence of catastrophizing thoughts and greater disability, the AT group had slower gait speed. Overall, these findings demonstrate that CLBP and AT have similarities that may allow clinicians to learn from one to inform treatment of the other.

The discrepancy in these results could be due to the different components and task-specific demands of individual exergame interventions. This open-label quasi-randomized study aimed to compare the efficacy of 2 different home-based dual-task exergame treatments on cognition, mobility, and balance in older people. Research Design and Methods: Fifty older adults (65–85 years of age) were allocated to one of two 8-week exergame interventions: Cognitive-Intensive Exergame Training (CIT) or Physical-Intensive Exergame Training (PIT). Cognitive functions, balance, and mobility were assessed at baseline and after 8 weeks. Group × time interaction was measured by repeated-measure ANOVA, and both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses were performed to assess the effectiveness of exergame interventions. Results: ITT analyses showed that improvement in visual processing speed and visuospatial working memory was greater in the CIT group, with a medium effect size (p = .04; η2 = 0.09 and p = .01; η2 = 0.12). The improvement in verbal memory and attention was significant within both groups (p < .05), but this improvement was not different between the groups (p > .05). A significant improvement in balance was also observed in the PIT group, with a medium effect size (p = .04; η2 = 0.09). Although mobility improved significantly in both groups (p < .01), there was no significant difference between groups (p = .08). These results were largely supported by the PP analysis. Discussion and Implications: Dual-task exergame training can improve mobility and cognition in older adults. However, the different cognitive and physical demands of these interventions may have varying impacts on fall risk and related physical or cognitive functions. Therefore, a training program that includes both cognitive and physical domains with appropriate intensity is essential for the development of tailored exergame interventions to reduce fall risk in older adults. Translational Significance: This study addresses the problem of conflicting findings regarding the effectiveness of exergames on fall risk and related physical and cognitive function in older adults. The findings suggest that tailored exergame interventions combining cognitive and physical domains can effectively improve outcomes related to fall risk in older adults, highlighting the need for comprehensive training programs in this population. By providing evidence-based recommendations, this research has implications for developing targeted interventions and reducing fall risk among older individuals, thereby enhancing their independence, safety, overall well-being, and quality of life. © The Author(s) 2023.",Aging; Dual task; Exercise; Exergaming; Fall,,"""Virtual Reality and Exergames in Rehabilitation and Exercise""",Virtual Reality Interventions in Motor Rehabilitation and Sports for Older Adults,Impact of Visual and Virtual Reality Interventions in Sports and Rehabilitation

In the present study, we simulated rectus femoris muscle atrophy experimentally and investigated the effect of pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) application on the atrophy development through muscle mass, maximal contraction force, and contraction–relaxation time. A quadriceps tendon rupture with a total tenotomy was created on the rats’ hind limbs, inhibiting knee extension for 6 weeks, and this restriction of the movement led to the development of disuse atrophy, while the control group underwent no surgery. The operated and control groups were divided into subgroups according to PEMF application (1.5 mT for 45 days) or no PEMF. All groups were sacrificed after 6 weeks and had their entire rectus femoris removed. To measure the contraction force, the muscles were placed in an organ bath connected to a transducer. As a result of the atrophy, muscle mass and strength were reduced in the operated group, while no muscle mass loss was observed in the operated PEMF group. Furthermore, measurements of single, incomplete and full tetanic contraction force and contraction time (CT) did not change significantly in the operated group that received the PEMF application.

Lactate threshold, maximal oxygen uptake, blood, and body composition tests were performed at different time points to investigate the changes in physiological performance. The data were analysed by a one-way repeated measures ANOVA and a paired sample T-test between the test results. During the training camp, systematic load monitoring was carried out. Lactate threshold velocity, lactate threshold heart rate, and upper body muscle mass increased significantly (p < 0.01) after moderate altitude training. Maximum oxygen uptake was reduced compared to pre-tests (p < 0.05). Aerobic capacity parameters (maximal oxygen uptake, haemoglobin, red blood cell count) did not significantly increase after athletes returned to sea level (p > 0.05). These findings suggest that 4 weeks of moderate altitude training can significantly improve athletes’ lactate threshold and upper body muscle mass; no significant improvement in other aerobic capacity was seen. Exposure time, training load, and nutritional strategies should be thoroughly planned for optimal training of skiers at moderate altitudes. © 2022 by the authors.",cross-country skiing; moderate altitude training; physiological performance,Adult; Altitude; East Asian People; Humans; Lactic Acid; Male; Oxygen; Oxygen Consumption; Skiing; Young Adult; lactic acid; oxygen; altitude; performance assessment; physiology; sport; training; adult; aerobic capacity; altitude; Article; blood analysis; body composition; Chinese; elite athlete; erythrocyte count; heart rate; hemoglobin blood level; human; human experiment; male; maximal oxygen uptake; monitoring; muscle mass; observational study; physical performance; sea level; skier; skiing; velocity; oxygen consumption; physiology; skiing; young adult,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Physiological and Biomechanical Responses in Sports Performance

However, less than half of U.S. adults reach this goal, with the proportion even smaller among adults with overweight or obesity. Moreover, regular PA declines after age 45–50. Previous research suggests a shift in national guidelines to emphasize PA of a self-selected intensity (i.e., self-paced), instead of prescribed moderate intensity PA, may result in better adherence to PA programs, particularly among midlife adults with overweight or obesity. The present paper presents the protocol for a field-based RCT testing the hypothesis that adherence to PA programs is improved when PA is explicitly recommended to be self-paced rather than prescribed at moderate intensity among midlife (ages 50–64) adults (N = 240) with overweight or obesity. All participants receive a 12-month intervention designed to help them overcome barriers to regular PA and are randomly assigned to either self-paced or prescribed moderate intensity PA. The primary outcome is total volume of PA (minutes by intensity) as measured by accelerometry. Secondary outcomes include self-reported min/week of PA and changes in bodyweight. Additionally, using ecological momentary assessment, we examine putative mediators of treatment effects. We hypothesize self-paced PA will lead to a more positive affective response to PA, more perceived autonomy, and lower perceived exertion during PA, and thus greater increases in PA behavior. Findings will have direct implications for PA intensity recommendations among midlife adults with overweight or obesity. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Affective response; Ecological momentary assessment; Exercise; Midlife adults; Physical activity; Self-pacing,Adult; Exercise; Humans; Middle Aged; Motivation; Obesity; Overweight; accelerometry; adult; Article; body mass; body weight; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; clinical outcome; comparative study; conceptual model; controlled study; ecological momentary assessment; exercise; exercise intensity; feeling scale; follow up; human; independent variable; middle aged; moderate intensity exercise; monetary reward; obesity; physical activity; pilot study; prescription; quality of life; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial (topic); valence (emotion); exercise; motivation; obesity; physiology; randomized controlled trial,"""Physical Activity and Health Outcomes in Aging Populations""",Physical Activity and Health in Older Adults,Physical Activity and Health Risks

Therefore, having optimal levels of muscle strength improves performance and reduces the injury rate. Objectives: The objectives of our study were (i) to determine the dynamometric profile of hip muscle strength in young soccer players by position, evaluated at different isokinetic speeds, (ii) to describe the conventional and functional unilateral muscle strength ratios, (iii) to analyze the bilateral balance. Methods: Thirty-seven male soccer players (age 17.02 ± 0.92 years) participated in the study. Strength assessment was performed with a functional electromechanical dynamometer, and concentric and eccentric strength of abductors, adductors, extensors and hip flexors were measured bilaterally at 0.5 m/s and 1 m/s. Results: For eccentric right hip abduction at 0.5 m/s, defenders are significantly stronger than midfielders (p = 0.013) and stronger than forwards (p = 0.140). For eccentric right hip adduction at 0.5 m/s, defenders are significantly stronger than midfielders (p = 0.005) and stronger than forwards (p = 0.253), as for eccentric right hip adduction at 1 m/s, defenders are significantly stronger than midfielders (p = 0.014) and stronger than forwards (p = 0.084). There is a significant effect for the conventional strength ratio of left abduction/adduction at 1 m/s. The conventional strength ratio of forwards is significantly higher than that of defenders (p = 0.045) and higher than that of midfielders (p = 0.152). Conclusions: Concentric and eccentric hip strength values differ according to playing position. © 2023 by the authors.",dynamometer; hip joint; muscle strength; soccer players,"Adolescent; Hip; Humans; Male; Muscle Strength; Muscle, Skeletal; Soccer; Sports; Thigh; injury; muscle; performance assessment; physical activity; sport; young population; abduction; adduction; adolescent; age; Article; body height; body mass; body weight; Chile; controlled study; cross-sectional study; dynamometry; hip muscle; human; human experiment; male; muscle strength; normal human; soccer; soccer player; velocity; hip; muscle strength; physiology; skeletal muscle; sport; thigh","Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Effects of Training Protocols on Injury Prevention and Performance in Soccer and Futsal Players

However, the absence of internal consistency reliability data has been raised as a concern. Internal consistency is relevant only for unidimensional measures. In other populations, LTPA is known to be a multidimensional construct, evaluated with multidimensional measures. We tested for unidimensionality through secondary analysis of PARA-SCI data (n = 703). Cronbach’s α was 0.227. Principal components analysis showed two components/dimensions (‘Moderate and Heavy Intensity LTPA’ and ‘Mild Intensity LTPA’) explained 73% of the variance. Binary logic crosstabulation produced no discernible patterns of behavioural interrelatedness across LTPA intensities. Together, these data demonstrate the multidimensionality of LTPA and the PARA-SCI is not unidimensional. Internal consistency should not be a criterion for evaluating LTPA questionnaires for use in studies of people with SCI. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to International Spinal Cord Society 2023.

However, determining isolated gait events from accelerometer signals, especially foot-off events during running, is an open problem. We outline a two-step approach where machine learning serves to predict vertical ground reaction forces from accelerometer signals, followed by force-based event detection. We collected shank accelerometer signals and ground reaction forces from 21 adults during comfortable walking and running on an instrumented treadmill. We trained one common reservoir computer using segmented data using both walking and running data. Despite being trained on just a small number of strides, this reservoir computer predicted vertical ground reaction forces in continuous gait with high quality. The subsequent foot contact and foot off event detection proved highly accurate when compared to the gold standard based on co-registered ground reaction forces. Our proof-of-concept illustrates the capacity of combining accelerometry with machine learning for detecting isolated gait events irrespective of mode of locomotion.

Methods: Seventeen male and female adults with chronic (> 1 yr) motor-complete and incomplete SCI (level of injury: C4-L3) were randomized to control (CON, n = 9) or exercise (UBROW, n = 8). Participants in UBROW performed 12-week, 3 weekly sessions of 30-min upper-body ergometer rowing exercise, complying with current exercise guidelines for SCI. Cardiorespiratory fitness (V ˙ O2peak), traditional risk factors (lipid profile, glycemic control) as well as inflammatory and vascular endothelium-derived biomarkers (derived from fasting blood samples) were measured before and after 6 (6W) and 12 weeks (12W). Brachial artery resting diameter and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) were determined by ultrasound as exploratory outcomes. Results: UBROW increased V ˙ O2peak from baseline (15.1 ± 5.1 mL/kg/min; mean ± SD) to 6W (16.5 ± 5.3; P < 0.01) and 12W (17.5 ± 6.1; P < 0.01). UBROW increased resting brachial artery diameter from baseline (4.80 ± 0.72 mm) to 12W (5.08 ± 0.91; P < 0.01), with no changes at 6W (4.96 ± 0.91), and no changes in CON. There were no significant time-by-group interactions in traditional cardiometabolic blood biomarkers, or in unadjusted or baseline diameter corrected FMD. Explorative analyses revealed inverse correlations between changes (∆12W-baseline) in endothelin-1 and changes in resting diameter (r = − 0.56) and FMD% (r = − 0.60), both P < 0.05.

Participants wore these leggings while walking on a treadmill under three conditions: the control group, compression leggings with a graduated application percentage, and compression leggings with a fixed application percentage. Pressure, foot progression angle, skin blood flow, joint angle, and user evaluation scores were measured for legs affected by in-toeing gait (n = 11). Statistical analysis compared these parameters among the three conditions. In the results, both compression leggings with a graduated application percentage and compression leggings with a fixed application percentage provided a partially graduated compression, resulting in pressure differences of 4.60 and 9.70 mmHg, respectively. Foot progression angle showed significant increases – 14.3% (p = 0.000) with compression leggings with a graduated application percentage and 31.1% (p = 0.000) with compression leggings with a fixed application percentage – compared with the control group condition. Skin blood flow also showed notable rises – 30.5% with compression leggings with a graduated application percentage and 61.1% (p = 0.000) with compression leggings with a fixed application percentage – compared with the control group, indicating the superior effectiveness of compression leggings with a fixed application percentage. Both compression leggings with a graduated application percentage (p = 0.000) and compression leggings with a fixed application percentage (p = 0.000) positively impacted the hip joint angle in the transverse plane, nearing the normal range when compared with controls. Acceptance of both compression leggings was high, with compression leggings with a fixed application percentage proving advantageous for gait correction and compression leggings with a graduated application percentage for ease of use during donning and doffing.

The survey included a validated physical activity questionnaire (Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly) plus 15 items aimed to address 1) perceptions and beliefs regarding physical activity, 2) barriers to routine physical activity, and 3) willingness and ability to participate in a physical activity intervention and 4) current physical abilities, activities, and preferences. Results: 95 participants with epilepsy (age 42 ± 16.2, 59 % female) completed the survey. Sixty-five participants (68.4 %) reported that they believe that physical activity could improve their seizure frequency. However, 40 % of those surveyed said their neurologist had never talked to them about physical activity. The most commonly reported barriers to physical activity were lack of time (24.7 %) and fear of having a seizure (19.7 %), while barriers to intervention participation included being unable to come to in-person sessions (53 % of those willing to participate),living far away (39.3 %), time constraints (28.6 %), and lack of transportation (21.4 %). Conclusion: Future physical activity studies in people with epilepsy should focus on using tailored interventions that accommodate their unique beliefs and barriers. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Behavioral intervention; Exercise; Implementation; Seizures,Adult; Aged; Epilepsy; Exercise; Fear; Female; Humans; Male; Seizures; Surveys and Questionnaires; adult; anticonvulsant therapy; anxiety; Article; behavior; controlled study; cross-sectional study; depression; disease association; epilepsy; fear; female; general health status assessment; health belief; health survey; human; major clinical study; male; medical history; perception; physical activity; Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly; risk factor; sedentary lifestyle; seizure duration; walking; aged; exercise; questionnaire; seizure,"""Physical Activity and Rehabilitation in Adults with Neurological Conditions""",Physical Activity and Rehabilitation Post-Injury,Physical Activity Engagement Barriers and Facilitators for Stroke Survivors

There is a high rate of injuries in Wrestling. To prevent injuries, it is necessary to identify the risk factors. Despite the functional importance of strength in wrestling, few studies have investigated the relationship between isokinetic strength and the rate of injuries in the sport. Objectives: The objective of the present study was to investigate the relationship between the isokinetic strength of elite wrestlers and the rate of injuries prospectively. Method: A total of 72 young wrestlers with at least 2 years of experience in the Tehran Wrestling Premier League participated in this study. Before the start of the competition season, the isokinetic strength of flexor and extensor muscles of the knee and shoulder were measured at different velocities by an isokinetic dynamometer. The injuries and training hours of these wrestlers were then recorded for nine months. Results: The study results showed no significant relationship between isokinetic strength of flexor and extensor muscles of the knee or shoulder at different angular speeds of 60, 180, and 300°/s. There was neither significant between the ratio of the strength flexor/extensor for knee and/or shoulder in young elite wrestlers with injuries. Conclusion: Isokinetic strength of lower and upper limb muscles alone cannot predict wrestlers' injuries. Therefore, the use of these tests is not recommended to evaluate the risk of injury in this population. © 2022, The Author(s).",Elite; Isokinetic strength; Muscles' strength ratio; Prediction of injuries; Wrestler,accident prevention; adult; arm muscle; Article; cohort analysis; competition game; controlled study; dynamometry; eccentric muscle contraction; extensor muscle; flexor muscle; human; knee; major clinical study; male; muscle isometric contraction; muscle strength; musculoskeletal injury; personal experience; prospective study; quadriceps femoris muscle; shoulder; shoulder muscle; wrestler; wrestling; young adult,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Injury Risk and Performance in Athletes

However, physical activity like exercise training tailored to the exposure and physical ability offers health prevention and rehabilitation. Professional nursing associations have advised squat training to promote occupational health because it strengthens lower limb and back muscles. Given that squatting is a fundamental part of many daily activities and various actions in caregiving processes, we hypothesized that chair squat performance is a potential predictor of nurses’ physical capabilities to perform occupational tasks. We conducted kinetic and electromyographic assessments of 289 chair squat repetitions and compared them to ergonomic patient transfer tasks. In this task, nurses transferred a supine patient to a lateral position in a care bed using similar movement characteristics of the squat task. This cross-sectional pilot study provides initial insights into nurses’ kinetic and muscle activation patterns of health-enhancing and compensational strategies. Highly asymmetric movements corresponded to distinct extremes in lower limb and spine muscle activity data—e.g., increased activity of the rectus femoris indicates increased hip flexion, including postural sway and, therefore, high torsional forces affecting the sacroiliac joints. The potential of the chair squat performance as a predictor of nurses’ physical capabilities in ergonomic patient transfers was quantified by a 2 × 2 contingency table resulting in an accuracy rate of 73%. © 2023, The Author(s).",,"Cross-Sectional Studies; Electromyography; Ergonomics; Humans; Muscle, Skeletal; Nurses; Patient Transfer; Pilot Projects; adult; article; care behavior; contingency table; controlled study; daily life activity; female; hip; human; lower limb; male; mechanical torsion; muscle contraction; muscle function; nurse; patient transport; pilot study; rectus femoris muscle; sacroiliac joint; spine; cross-sectional study; electromyography; ergonomics; physiology; skeletal muscle",Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Management and Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

Environmental, socio-economic and training strategy differences warrant similar research in a South African context. The purpose of this preliminary study was to establish whether South African pace bowlers have similar BV and injury associates compared to other elite fast bowlers. Methods: This study was a prospective, observational, cohort study that monitored match and training BV and injuries amongst pace bowlers playing for the South African national team between April 2017 and April 2019. A sample of convenience that included 14 bowlers was selected. Bowling volume was quantified as the number of deliveries bowled during training and competition. Acute-, chronic- and acute:chronic BV ratios were independently modelled as association variables. Results: There were 39 injuries with the most being to the lumbar spine (25.64%). Moderate-to-low and a moderate-to-high acute:chronic bowling load ratios were associated with a lower risk of injury. Chronic bowling load was associated with injury (z = 2.82, p = 0.01). A low acute workload, low chronic workload, moderate-high chronic workload and moderate-low acute:chronic ratio were also associated with an increased risk of injury. Conclusion: These findings confirm that there appears to be a dose–response effect between training BV and the likelihood of an injury occurring with a moderate-to-low and a moderate-to-high BV ratio being optimal. Considering the small sample size, the findings should be interpreted with caution. © The Author(s) 2023.",Acute:chronic workload ratio; lumbar spine; training,,"""Muscle Strength, Endurance, and Injury Risk in Upper-Extremity Sports Performance""",Muscular Strength and Injury Risk in Athletes,Injury Risk and Performance in Athletes

This study aims to investigate the impact of training protocols based on the two approaches to improving CMJ. Thirty-six subjects with an average age of 26 years were selected and divided into two groups: the ecological-dynamic group (EDG) and the cognitive group (CG). For 12 weeks, both groups followed separate protocols of three weekly one-hour sessions. EDG group followed a protocol focused on circle time. The CG group followed an instructor-led training protocol. Incoming and outgoing flight heights were measured. Pre and post-intervention differences within and between groups were assessed using t-tests for dependent and independent samples, respectively (p ≤ 0.05). CG demonstrated a 12.2% increase in CMJ and a 7.8% improvement in CMJFA, while EDG showed a 10.2% increase in CMJ and 19.5% progress in CMJFA. No statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) were observed between the groups in the improvement of CMJ; statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were found in the improvement of CMJFA in favor of EDG. © 2023 by the authors.",countermovement jump; explosive-elastic strength; learning approaches; sports training,,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Effects of different training methods on athletic performance and injury prevention

Using an in-shoe motion sensor (IMS) with power-saving functions is a potential solution. In this study, we challenged the development of an estimation model of foot function using the foot center of pressure excursion index (CPEI) as an index via linear multivariate regression, which is sufficiently light for this type of IMS. Data collected from 65 and 17 participants were involved in model construction and validation, respectively. We validated ten scenarios simulating daily living activities, including walking on different surfaces, using different shoes, with or without carrying a bag, and indoors and outdoors. We applied statistical parametric mapping (SPM) to determine significant predictors and performed our original feature selection algorithm, leave-one-subject-out least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), to compress the volume of the predictors. We successfully discovered significant sex-specific predictors for foot function estimation from foot motion and constructed large effect-sized sex-specific foot function estimation models that achieved high-precision CPEI estimation. In the validation, the model successfully estimated a maximum of 99.0% and 100.0% males' and females' data under the same experimental conditions with the training data and 92.8%-100.0% and 85.8%-100.0% data in different scenarios.

Background: CRF is a prominent symptom among cancer patients. In patients treated for CRC, CRF is associated with adjuvant treatments, low quality of life and reduced ability to self-manage. Methods: One hundred thirty-four patients with CRC treated at a Norwegian university hospital between 2016–2018 were included. The Schwartz Cancer Fatigue Scale-6 and the Patient Experience with Treatment and Self-management questionnaires were applied for data collection. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics and non-parametric approaches to analyse correlations and identify differences between groups. The study adhered to STROBE Statement checklist for reporting of cross-sectional studies. Results: Median fatigue level was 10.0 (range: 7.0–13.0). Physical fatigue was higher than perceptual fatigue, with medians of 6.0 (interquartile range [IQR]: 3.0–13.0) and 4.0 (IQR: 3.0–12.0), respectively. Higher fatigue levels were associated with age <60 years, advanced cancer and adjuvant treatments. Increased CRF was significantly associated with higher treatment burden on seven of the nine dimensions, adjusted for demographic and clinical variables. The association of fatigue and treatment burden was stronger in survivors <60 years, with advanced cancer, 6–12 months since surgery or who had more comorbid conditions. Conclusions: This study showed patients at risk of experiencing CRF following CRC treatment. It established proof of associations between CRF and treatment burden and identified subgroups of CRC patients where this association was stronger. Relevance to clinical practice: Screening of CRF in CRC patients can help clinicians provide individualized treatment and care to manage CRF. Clinicians should consider the association between CRF and treatment burden, especially in subgroups of CRF patients. © 2021 The Authors.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate patient characteristics and outcomes associated with MCID achievement after TKA using the PROMIS-PF measure. Methods: A retrospective review of 263 patients undergoing TKA with preoperative and 1-year postoperative PROMIS-PF scores from March 12, 2020 to February 8, 2022 was performed. Three multivariate models were built to evaluate predictors of MCID achievement. Preoperative predictors evaluated included demographics, comorbidities, history of spine and knee surgery, and baseline PROMIS-PF. Postoperative clinical outcomes evaluated included lengths of stay, discharge statuses, complications, and utilizations of other orthopaedic services. Results: There were 109 patients (41%) who achieved an MCID at 1-year postoperatively. Non-white patients had 2.17 times lower odds of achieving MCID. No clinical outcomes assessed were independently predictive of MCID achievement. During the 1-year postoperative period, 63% of patients sought care for another orthopaedic condition. Patients requiring postoperative injections on another joint had a 2.27 times lower odds of achieving MCID. Those seen for spine conditions postoperatively had a 2.44 lower odds of achieving MCID. Conclusions: Race, postoperative injections, and treatment for spine conditions after TKA were independent predictors of failure to achieve MCID. These results may guide preoperative patient consultation and risk-adjustment in future studies using PROMIS-PF as an endpoint for evaluation of TKA outcomes. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",clinically relevant improvement; outcomes; patient-reported outcomes; racial disparities; total knee arthroplasty,"Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Humans; Orthopedics; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome; opiate; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; adult; aged; American Society of Anaesthesiologists score; anesthesiologist; Article; body mass; cerebrovascular disease; Charlson Comorbidity Index; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical outcome; concomitant orthopedic condition; congestive heart failure; consultation; diabetes mellitus; electronic medical record; emergency ward; female; heart infarction; hemiplegia; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; kidney disease; knee surgery; length of stay; major clinical study; male; medicare; minimal clinically important difference; orthopedics; peptic ulcer; peripheral vascular disease; postoperative care; postoperative period; retrospective study; rheumatoid arthritis; risk factor; spine fusion; total knee arthroplasty; knee replacement; patient-reported outcome; risk factor; treatment outcome","""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Hip Arthroscopy Outcomes and Rehabilitation

Despite the documented benefits of CR programs, the participation remains suboptimal. Home-based CR programs have been proposed to improve uptake and adherence. The goal of this study was to apply an end-to-end methodology including machine learning techniques to predict the 6-month adherence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients to a home-based telemonitoring CR program, combining patients’ clinical information with their actual program participation during a short familiarization phase. Fifty CVD patients participated in such a program for 6 months, enabling personalized guidance during a phase III CR study. Clinical, fitness, and psychological data were measured at baseline, whereas actual adherence, in terms of weekly exercise session duration and patient heart rate, was measured using wearables. Hierarchical clustering was used to identify different groups based on (1) patients’ clinical baseline characteristics, (2) exercise adherence during the familiarization phase, and (3) the whole program adherence, whereas the output of the clustering was determined using repetitive decision trees (DTs) and random forest (RF) techniques to predict long-term adherence. Finally, for each cluster of patients, network analysis was applied to discover correlations of their characteristics that link to adherence. Based on baseline characteristics, patients were clustered into three groups, with differences in behavior and risk factors, whereas adherent, non-adherent, and transient adherent patients were identified during the familiarization phase. Regarding the prediction of long-term adherence, the most common DT showed higher performance compared with RF (precision: 80.2 ± 19.5% and 71.8 ± 25.8%, recall: 94.5 ± 14.5% and 71.8 ± 25.8% for DT and RF accordingly). The analysis of the DT rules and the analysis of the feature importance of the RF model highlighted the significance of non-adherence during the familiarization phase, as well as that of the baseline characteristics to predict future adherence. Network analysis revealed different relationships in different clusters of patients and the interplay between their behavioral characteristics. In conclusion, the main novelty of this study is the application of machine learning techniques combining patient characteristics before the start of the home-based CR programs with data during a short familiarization phase, which can predict long-term adherence with high accuracy. The data used in this study are available through connected health technologies and standard measurements in CR; thus, the proposed methodology can be generalized to other telerehabilitation programs and help healthcare providers to improve patient-tailored enrolment strategies and resource allocation. © 2023 by the authors.",adherence; cardiac rehabilitation; exercise; familiarization phase; home-based; machine learning; prediction; telemonitoring,,"""Physical Activity, Rehabilitation, and Health Outcomes in Medical Conditions""",Impact of Exercise and Rehabilitation on Quality of Life and Health in Patients,Physical Activity and Health Risks

Identification of patients at risk for a prolonged recovery after a musculoskeletal injury is thus of high relevance. The aim of the current study was to show the feasibility of using a machine learning assisted model to predict functional recovery based on the pre- and immediate post injury patient activity as measured with wearable systems in trauma patients. Patients with a pre-existing wearable (smartphone and/or body-worn sensor), data availability of at least 7 days prior to their injury, and any musculoskeletal injury of the upper or lower extremity were included in this study. Patient age, sex, injured extremity, time off work and step count as activity data were recorded continuously both pre- and post-injury. Descriptive statistics were performed and a logistic regression machine learning model was used to predict the patient's functional recovery status after 6 weeks based on their pre- and post-injury activity characteristics. Overall 38 patients (7 upper extremity, 24 lower extremity, 5 pelvis, 2 combined) were included in this proof-of-concept study. The average follow-up with available wearable data was 85.4 days. Based on the activity data, a predictive model was constructed to determine the likelihood of having a recovery of at least 50 % of the pre-injury activity state by post injury week 6. Based on the individual activity by week 3 a predictive accuracy of over 80 % was achieved on an independent test set (F1=0,82; AUC=0,86; ACC=8,83). The employed model is feasible to assess the principal risk for a slower recovery based on readily available personal wearable activity data. The model has the potential to identify patients requiring additional aftercare attention early during the treatment course, thus optimizing return to the pre-injury status through focused interventions. Additional patient data is needed to adapt the model to more specifically focus on different fracture entities and patient groups. © 2023",Advanced analytics; Artificial intelligence; Bring your own device; Pre-injury activity; Wearable activity monitor,"Feasibility Studies; Fractures, Bone; Humans; Machine Learning; Wearable Electronic Devices; adult; age; aged; Article; clinical article; controlled study; female; follow up; functional status; human; lower limb; machine learning; male; musculoskeletal injury; physical activity; sex; step count; upper limb; feasibility study; fracture","""Application of Machine Learning and Biomechanics in Musculoskeletal Health and Wearable Devices""","Knee Assessment and Recovery: Validity, Reliability, and Clinical Trials",Wearable Devices and Techniques in Gait Analysis and Mobility Rehabilitation

Exercise that can increase the power of the back muscles, leg muscles and dynamic balance is physical exercise in core stability exercise (CSE). This study aimed to analyse core stability exercise's effect on increasing back muscle strength, leg muscles, and dynamic balance in the elderly. Fifty-six elderly people aged 60-70 years were selected by simple random sampling as the sample in this study. The exercise program was given CSE (n: 28) for four weeks as the intervention group. The back and leg muscle strength were measured using the Back-leg dynamometer and balance measurement using the Time Up Go Test (TUGT). T-test and Mann-Whitney analyses were used to compare the results before and after the intervention. The different tests between the intervention and the control group obtained a p-value of 0.001, meaning an effect of CSE to increase the strength of the back muscles, leg muscles, and dynamic balance in the elderly existed. This study proved that CSE effectively increased back muscle strength, leg muscles and dynamic balance in the elderly. It is suggested to analyze the effectiveness of CSE based on the characteristics of the respondents. © 2023, Universitas Jenderal Soedirman.

Our aim was to evaluate the usefulness of an easy, structured, and home-based exercise program to improve physical performance and quality-of-life in patients with obesity. Methods: A cohort of patients with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) was recruited during 2017-2020. Patients who met the inclusion criteria were invited and those who accepted signed informed consent. Patients were evaluated by the same team of physicians who performed the 6-min walking test and collected the clinical and biochemical variables, also applied quality-of-life questionnaire at baseline and 3 months after starting the exercise program that was divided in two levels: level 1: active mobilization of four limbs (15 min) + cardiovascular exercise (15 min walking), 5 days/week; level 2: eight strengthening exercises for upper and lower limbs with an elastic band + cardiovascular exercise (15 min walking), 5 days/week. This study used means (SD), frequencies (percent), Student's t test, and Pearson correlation test. Results: We included 151 patients, mostly women (81.5%), age 46.3 ± 9.8 years old, BMI 40.3 ± 8.56 kg/m2, 34.4% performed some type of exercise, and the most frequents comorbidities were dyslipidemia and diabetes. After 3 months, 86 patients (57%) remained in the study and attended the final evaluation. Evident changes in physical performance were reported (distance traveled, speed walking and VO2max); however, improvement in quality of life was remarkable. Conclusion: An easy, structured, and home-based exercise program improves physical performance and quality of life in patients with obesity, without losing its benefits for the health.  © 2023 The Author(s).

This raises the question: what is the extent to which physical exercise training affected, symptoms of depression, physical activity level (PAL) and social participation in PLWHA compared to other forms of intervention, usual care, or no treatment controls? Method: Eight databases were searched up to July 2020, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol. Only randomised controlled trials involving adults who were either on HAART/HAART-naïve and reported in the English language, were included. Two independent reviewers determined the eligibility of the studies, extracted data, assessed their quality, and risk of bias using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) tool. Standardised mean difference (SMD) was used as summary statistics for the mean primary outcome (symptoms of depression) and secondary outcomes (PAL and social participation) since different measuring tools/units were used across the included studies. Summary estimates of effects were determined using a random-effects model (I2). Results: Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria with 779 participants (n = 596 participants at study completion) randomised into the study groups, comprising 378 males, 310 females and 91 participants with undisclosed gender, and with an age range of 18–86 years. Across the studies, aerobic or aerobic plus resistance exercises were performed 2–3 times/week, at 40–60 min/session, and for between 6-24 weeks, and the risk of bias vary from high to low. Comparing the intervention to control groups showed significant difference in the symptoms of depression (SMD = − 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) − 1.01, − 0.48, p ≤ 0.0002; I2 = 47%; 5 studies; 205 participants) unlike PAL (SMD = 0.98, 95% CI − 0.25, 2.17, p = 0.11; I2 = 82%; 2 studies; 62 participants) and social participation (SMD = 0.04, 95% CI − 0.65, 0.73, p = 0.91; I2 = 90%; 6 studies; 373 participants). Conclusion: Physical exercise training could have an antidepressant-like effect in PLWHA but did not affect PAL and social participation. However, the high heterogeneity in the included studies, implies that adequately powered randomised controlled trials with clinical/methodological similarity are required in future studies.

The aim was to investigate whether resident participation affects postoperative complication rates, operative time, and length of stay. Methods: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program registry was queried from 2006 to 2012 for patients undergoing total elbow arthroplasty. A 1:1 propensity score match was performed to match resident cases to attending-only cases. Comorbidities, surgical time, and short-term (30-day) postoperative complications were compared between groups. Multivariate Poisson regression was used to compare the rates of postoperative adverse events between groups. Results: After propensity score match, 124 cases (50% with resident participation) were included. Adverse event rate after surgery was 18.5%. On multivariate analysis, there were no significant differences between attending-only cases and resident involved cases, with regards to short-term major complications, minor complications, or any complications (all p > 0.071). Total operative time was similar between cohorts (149.16 vs. 165.66 min; p = 0.157). No difference was observed in the length of hospital stay (2.95 vs. 2.6 days), p = 0.399.

These injuries can result in severe degeneration and neuronal cell death in the CNS, including the retina, which is a crucial part of the brain responsible for perceiving and transmitting visual information. The long-term effects of mild–repetitive TBI (rmTBI) are far less studied thus far, even though damage induced by repetitive injuries occurring in the brain is more common, especially amongst athletes. rmTBI can also have a detrimental effect on the retina and the pathophysiology of these injuries is likely to differ from severe TBI (sTBI) retinal injury. Here, we show how rmTBI and sTBI can differentially affect the retina. Our results indicate an increase in the number of activated microglial cells and Caspase3-positive cells in the retina in both traumatic models, suggesting a rise in the level of inflammation and cell death after TBI. The pattern of microglial activation appears distributed and widespread but differs amongst the various retinal layers. sTBI induced microglial activation in both the superficial and deep retinal layers. In contrast to sTBI, no significant change occurred following the repetitive mild injury in the superficial layer, only the deep layer (spanning from the inner nuclear layer to the outer plexiform layer) shows microglial activation. This difference suggests that alternate response mechanisms play a role in the case of the different TBI incidents. The Caspase3 activation pattern showed a uniform increase in both the superficial and deep layers of the retina. This suggests a different action in the course of the disease in sTBI and rmTBI models and points to the need for new diagnostic procedures. Our present results suggest that the retina might serve as such a model of head injuries since the retinal tissue reacts to both forms of TBI and is the most accessible part of the human brain. © 2023 by the authors.",apoptosis; brain; caspase; degeneration; injury; microglia; retina; TBI,"Animals; Brain Concussion; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Disease Models, Animal; Humans; Inflammation; Microglia; Retina; caspase 3; isoflurane; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell activation; cell count; cell death; controlled study; diagnostic procedure; disease course; enzyme activation; inflammation; male; microglia; neurofilament; nonhuman; rat; retina; traumatic brain injury; animal; brain concussion; disease model; human; metabolism; microglia; retina","""Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion: Studies on Impacts, Recovery, and Influences""",Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion Studies in Young Athletes,Post-Concussion Symptoms and Recovery in Adolescents

However, little is known whether exercise engagement prior to MI is related to the magnitude of post-MI cardiac biomarker concentrations and clinical outcomes. Objectives We tested the hypothesis that exercise engagement in the week prior MI is related to lower cardiac biomarker concentrations following ST-elevated MI (STEMI). Methods We recruited hospitalised STEMI patients and assessed the amount of exercise engagement in the 7 days preceding MI onset using a validated questionnaire. Patients were classified as 'exercise' if they performed any vigorous exercise in the week prior MI, or as 'control' if they did not. Post-MI peak concentrations of high-sensitive cardiac troponin T (peak-hs-cTnT) and creatine kinase (peak-CK) were examined. We also explored whether exercise engagement prior MI is related to the clinical course (duration of hospitalisation and incidence of in-hospital, 30-day and 6-month major adverse cardiac events (reinfarction, target vessel revascularisation, cardiogenic shock or death)). Results In total, 98 STEMI patients were included, of which 16% (n=16) was classified as 'exercise', and 84% (n=82) as 'control'. Post-MI peak-hs-cTnT and peak-CK concentrations were lower in the exercise group (941 (645-2925) ng/mL; 477 (346-1402) U/L, respectively) compared with controls (3136 (1553-4969) ng/mL, p=0.010; 1055 (596-2019) U/L, p=0.016, respectively). During follow-up, no significant differences were found between both groups. Conclusion Engagement in exercise is associated with lower cardiac biomarker peak concentrations following STEMI. These data could provide further support for the cardiovascular health benefits of exercise training.  © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group.

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is one of these therapies, but it still lacks consistent results. Purpose: To evaluate the effects (benefits and harms) of PRP intra-articular injection compared with other nonsurgical methods for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. Study Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and quasi–randomized controlled trials; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Three electronic databases were searched to identify relevant studies published before January 2021. The primary outcomes were pain, function, and failure of treatment. Risks of bias of all trials were assessed using a Cochrane risk of bias tool. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation System was used to assess the quality of evidence of included studies. Results: A total of 40 studies with 3035 participants were included. Analysis of this review focused on comparing PRP with hyaluronic acid, corticosteroid, and saline, as we believe they are the most relevant comparisons with the most studies available. At 6-month follow-up, PRP was as effective as and in some studies more effective than other therapies regarding pain, function, and stiffness. However, current evidence is of low or very low quality and is based on trials with high risk of bias and great heterogeneity among them. No significant difference among treatments was found concerning major adverse events and treatment failure. Conclusion: Although studies suggest that PRP may be more effective than or at least as effective as other modalities of nonsurgical treatment for knee osteoarthritis in terms of pain, function, and adverse events, serious limitations and methodological flaws are considerable in the current literature. Therefore, the authors are not able to make recommendations for clinical practice regarding PRP for knee osteoarthritis. © 2022 The Author(s).",knee osteoarthritis; meta-analysis; platelet-rich plasma; systematic review,"Humans; Hyaluronic Acid; Injections, Intra-Articular; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Pain; Pain Measurement; Platelet-Rich Plasma; Treatment Outcome; hyaluronic acid; human; intraarticular drug administration; knee osteoarthritis; meta analysis; pain; pain measurement; procedures; thrombocyte rich plasma; treatment outcome",Advancements in Therapies and Technologies for Osteoarthritis and Joint Disorders,Therapeutic Interventions and Their Efficacy in Osteoarthritis Treatment,Efficacy and Safety of Different Treatments for Osteoarthritis

Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that PA ≤ 6.47% was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 3.137, 95% CI: 1.667–5.904, P < 0.001) and cardiac death (HR value 3.345, 95% CI: 1.394–8.028, P = 0.007). Conclusions: Daily PA of about 1.5 h was associated with lower all-cause mortality and cardiac death risk in patients with age > 75 years and high risk of SCD with ICDs/CRTDs. PA monitoring may aid in long-term management of older patients at high risk of SCD. © 2022, The Author(s).",All-cause mortality; Cardiac death; Implantable device measured objective physical activity; Patients over 75 years old; Sudden cardiac death,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Death, Sudden, Cardiac; Defibrillators, Implantable; Exercise; Humans; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; aged; cohort analysis; exercise; human; implantable cardioverter defibrillator; retrospective study; risk factor; sudden cardiac death; very elderly","""Physical Activity and Health Outcomes in Aging Populations""",Physical Activity and Health in Older Adults,Physical Activity and Health Risks

Design: This was a secondary causal mediation analysis of a four-arm randomised controlled trial testing Pilates exercise dosage (once, twice or thrice per week) against a booklet control. Participants: Two hundred and fifty-five people with chronic low back pain. Data analysis: All analyses were conducted in R software (version 4.1.2) following a preregistered analysis plan. A directed acyclic graph was constructed to identify potential pre-treatment mediator-outcome confounders. For each mediator model, we estimated the intervention-mediator effect, the mediator-outcome effect, the total natural indirect effect (TNIE), the pure natural direct effect (PNDE), and the total effect (TE). Results: Pain catastrophising mediated the effect of Pilates exercise compared with control on the outcomes pain intensity (TNIE MD –0.21, 95% CI –0.47 to –0.03) and physical function (TNIE MD –0.64, 95% CI –1.20 to –0.18). Kinesiophobia mediated the effect of Pilates exercise compared with control on the outcomes pain intensity (TNIE MD –0.31, 95% CI –0.68 to –0.02) and physical function (TNIE MD –1.06, 95% CI –1.70 to –0.49). The proportion mediated by each mediator was moderate (21 to 55%). Conclusion: Reductions in pain catastrophising and kinesiophobia partially mediated the pathway to improved pain intensity and physical function when using Pilates exercise for chronic low back pain. These psychological components may be important treatment targets for clinicians and researchers to consider when prescribing exercise for chronic low back pain. © 2023 Australian Physiotherapy Association",Exercise; Low back pain; Mediation analysis; Physical therapy; Pilates,Chronic Pain; Exercise Movement Techniques; Exercise Therapy; Humans; Kinesiophobia; Low Back Pain; Mediation Analysis; chronic pain; controlled study; human; kinesiophobia; kinesiotherapy; low back pain; mediation analysis; psychology; randomized controlled trial,"""Pain Management and Musculoskeletal Health in Various Populations""",Chronic Pain Management and Treatment Studies,Management and Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

In response, this study aimed to assess the immediate effects of toe separators on dynamic stability and ankle range of motion in healthy young individuals. Methods: Among the 68 eligible participants, 50 healthy and active subjects completed all trials. The impact of the intervention was evaluated using the Weight Bearing Lunge Test and Y-Test. The control condition performed the tests without toe separators, while the experimental condition performed the tests with toe separators. All participants performed both conditions with a wash-out period of at least 7 days between trials. Results: Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in dynamic balance (p > 0.05) and range of motion (p > 0.05) between the two conditions. Additionally, no asymmetries were detected between the lower limbs in both tests (p > 0.05). Conclusions: The results of this pilot study indicate that using toe separators does not have an immediate effect on ankle range of motion and dynamic balance in young, healthy individuals.

Local therapeutic drugs, such as glucocorticoids, cause adverse effects on the metabolism of tendon tissues and injection-related complications. Therefore, new administration modalities for tendinopathy need to be developed. In this study, we designed a hydrogel-based microneedle (MN) system for the long-term transdermal delivery of our novel biological cell-free fat extract (CEFFE) to treat tendinopathies. We found that CEFFE-loaded MNs (CEFFE-MNs) had good biosafety and inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced apoptosis and matrix degradation in Achilles tendon cells of rats. The Achilles tendons of rats returned to their maximum mechanical strength after applying CEFFE-MNs. The administration of CEFFE-MNs had better anti-apoptosis and tendon repair-promoting effects than CEFEF injections in vivo. Transcriptome sequencing indicated that the anti-apoptosis effect of CEFFE-MNs was highly related to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling. CEFFE-MNs inhibited the expression of TNF, TNF receptor 1, and downstream nuclear factor-kappa B signaling. Additionally, CEFFE-MNs rescued LPS-induced mitochondrial dynamics in tendon cells via the TNF-Drp1 axis. Our study reports a novel CEFFE-MN system that exhibits long-term anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, suggesting it as a new treatment route for tendinopathy with broad clinical translation prospects. © 2023",Anti-apoptosis; Cell-free fat extract; Microneedle; Tendinopathy; Tumor necrosis factor,Cell death; Mitochondria; Needles; Rats; Tendons; Tumors; Achilles tendons; Anti-apoptosis; Cell-free; Cell-free fat extract; Induced apoptosis; Lipopolysaccharides; Microneedles; Mitochondrial damage; Tendinopathy; Tumor necrosis factors; Glycoproteins,"""Achilles Tendinopathy and Musculoskeletal Ultrasound Studies in Sport Medicine""",Achilles Tendon Health & Rehabilitation Research,Advances in Tissue Regeneration and Healing in Musculoskeletal Disorders

Thus, efforts to address depressive symptoms among stroke inpatients are warranted to in turn lessen sedentary behaviour. Despite evidence that virtual reality (VR) is emerging as a method to help with depression, the use of VR to improve depression among inpatient stroke survivors has yet to be studied. In this paper, we report on the protocol investigating the feasibility of a VR entertainment system at improving depressive symptoms among stroke survivors receiving inpatient rehabilitation. Methods: In this single-blind randomized controlled trial, 30 inpatient stroke survivors from the rehabilitation unit at Kelowna General Hospital will be randomized to either (1) intervention: 3 times per week of VR entertainment for duration of inpatient rehabilitation or (2) control: usual care. Individuals will be included if they have a confirmed diagnosis of stroke, are 19 years of age or older, able to provide informed consent, have physician clearance to participate in the study (medically stable or fit), or are able to understand English. Outcome measures to address depressive symptoms (primary outcome), sedentary behaviour, motivation, anxiety, stress, and happiness (secondary outcome) will be administered at two timepoints: (1) baseline (T1) and (2) post-intervention (T2). Study analyses will consider study feasibility indicators and clinical (statistical) outcomes. Means and standard deviations (for continuous variables) and frequencies and proportions (for categorical variables) will be used to summarize the variables. Feasibility indicators will be dichotomized into either ‘success’ if they meet the a priori criteria, or ‘revise’ if they do not meet the criteria. Intervention effects post-intervention (T2) for the primary and secondary clinical outcomes will be estimated using linear regression including baseline (T1) controlling for age and sex. Discussion: The results of this trial will add to our understanding of depression and sedentary behaviour among individuals receiving inpatient stroke rehabilitation as well as the feasibility of a VR entertainment program to improve depressive symptoms, which will in turn may lessen sedentary behaviour in inpatient stroke survivors.

The study involved collecting data from both devices in dual- and single-leg standing positions with eyes open and closed and using statistical measures to compare their performance. The results showed that MOTI can accurately measure balance during dual-leg standing tasks but has poor to moderate performance during single-leg standing tasks. However, it could detect small changes in postural sway caused by a reduced base of support and/or visual feedback. The study also found that the test-retest reliability was poor to moderate for both devices. These findings suggest that MOTI has potential as a reliable tool for measuring balance during certain tasks, but further research is needed to improve its performance during single-leg standing. This study provides valuable insights into the validity and reliability of MOTI for measuring balance and highlights the need for further investigation.  © 2023 De Gruyter.

In this study, we hypothesize that salivary gland hypofunction may be associated with systemic diseases and homeostasis and effectively managing salivary gland hypofunction might provide benefits in both salivary gland and systemic homeostasis. This hypothesis is largely based on a number of currently reported knowledge bases, including altered salivary composition and flow leading to an increased risk of oral diseases and reduced oral function, links between oral disease and systemic conditions, disruptions in the nitrate cycle, and disturbances in the oral and intestinal microbiota.

If practical, undertaking HIIT in the home setting could be a way to encourage continued participation. However, no home-based HIIT programme has been developed for this population. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to co-create a feasible, accessible, and safe home-based HIIT programme for PwP, including intervention components and logic model. This supports the longer term aim to assess the practicality and utility of home-based HIIT for PwP. The study included three stages. Firstly, an initial HIIT programme and logic model proposal was developed based on existing evidence. This was refined through an iterative, co-creative process of focus groups, exercise testing and interviews involving end-users and relevant stakeholders. Finally, a draft intervention was produced with further co-creator input. During the iterative process, five focus groups, 10 exercise testing sessions and 10 post exercise interviews were undertaken, involving academic researchers, 6 PwP, one family member and two clinicians. These co-creators developed HIIT-Home4Parkinson’s (HH4P), a 12-week thrice weekly home-based HIIT programme for PwP based on adaptability, individualisation, and remote support. Despite methodological limitations within the development process, the co-created HH4P programme could be feasible, safe, and useful for PwP. A feasibility study should now be undertaken to address remaining uncertainties prior to a full trial. © 2023 by the authors.",co-creation; exercise; HIIT; neurodegenerative; Parkinson’s; rehabilitation,Exercise Test; Exercise Therapy; Feasibility Studies; High-Intensity Interval Training; Humans; Parkinson Disease; accessibility; feasibility study; health services; nervous system disorder; physical activity; safety; testing method; training; adult; Article; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; exercise intensity; feasibility study; female; high intensity interval training; home care; human; intervention study; male; middle aged; outcome assessment; Parkinson disease; patient attendance; patient compliance; patient safety; personalized medicine; exercise test; kinesiotherapy,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Physical inactivity is one of the primary factors that lead to obesity and overweight. It is common problem among the population of those who are in service or work. The reason behind obesity and the lack of physical activity are multifactorial. Purpose. The present study aimed to investigate the physical activity profile of the school teacher and to identify the factors that have a significant influence on the lack of physical activity. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted via a self-reported questionnaire among primary to post-graduate grade school teachers. The data was collected based on the standardized short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and the demographic questionnaire including questions about sex, age, body composition, resting metabolic rate, and vital capacity of the participants. Results. The study consisted of hundred school teachers including 58 male teachers and 42 female teachers. The average age of the male respondents was 45.02 years with a standard deviation ± 6.44, and for female respondents was 39.39 years with a standard deviation ± 5.85. The average vigorous physical activity of male teachers was 36.31 minutes/per week, and for female teachers was 5.95 minutes/per week. In moderate physical activity, males were averagely engaged for 20.61 minutes/per week, and females were 6.82 minutes/per week. The average minutes of walking for males was 115 minutes/per week, and for females was 130 minutes per week. A significant reduction in resting heart rate was reported between inactive, minimally active, and active participants.

There, however, is still no comprehensive data on the type, intensity and duration of training for these women. Objective: The current study aimed to investigate the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on metabolic, hormonal and cardiovascular indices in women with PCOS compared to a control group. Methods: In a randomized controlled study, 28 patients (age: 23.8 ± 5.3 years, weight: 82.4 ± 9.7 kg, BMI: 30.33 ± 3.99 kg/m2) were divided into two groups including HIIT (n = 14) and the control (n = 14). The training protocol was performed with 100–110 maximum aerobic velocity (MAV), 4–6 sets, 4 laps, 3 sessions per week for eight weeks. Anthropometric indices, aerobic performance, insulin resistance and sensitivity, lipid profiles, testosterone, cortisol and hs-CRP were evaluated. Results: The HIIT intervention decreased BMI, waist to hip ratio (WHR), visceral fat, insulin, insulin resistance, low density lipoprotein (LDL), atherogenic index, cholesterol and cortisol (P < 0.05). All variables remained unchanged in the control group (P > 0.05). Except for VAI, FBG, HDL, TG and AIP, the rest of the variables in the training and control groups show a significant difference (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The results of the present study indicate that eight weeks of HIIT has beneficial effects on anthropometric, insulin sensitivity, fat profile, and inflammatory and cardiovascular indices in PCOS patients. It seems that the intensity of HIIT (100–110 MAV) is a determining factor in creating optimal adaptations in PCOS patients. Trail registration: IRCT20130812014333N143. Registration date: 22/03/2020.

Results: The intra-rater reliability of the CROM was excellent for both raters for head posture and all head movements (ICC>0.9, 95% CI: 0.82–0.99, p < 0.01). The inter-rater reliability was excellent for head posture (ICC>0.95, 95% CI: 0.92–0.98, p < 0.01) and good-to-excellent for all movements at both time-points (ICC = 0.73–0.98, 95%CI: 0.45–0.99, p < 0.01). The validity analysis showed moderate-to-strong correlation between instruments for the head posture and head movements [(r) = -0.47 to −0.78), 95% CI: 0.99 to −0.24, p < 0.01]. Conclusion: The CROM instrument has good-to-excellent reliability and adequate validity for measuring cervical position and displacement in the sagittal plane. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",CROM; Neck; Physical examination; Protraction; Retraction,adult; article; concurrent validity; controlled study; diagnosis; head movement; head position; human; interrater reliability; intrarater reliability; neck; normal human; physical examination; range of motion; reliability; validity,"""Balance, Mobility, and Fall Risks in Aging and Musculoskeletal Conditions""",Impact and Control of Chronic Low Back Pain and Balance in Older Adults,Management and Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

The purpose of this study is to explore whether the use of ice popsicle could prevent emergence agitation in children undergoing oral surgery with sevoflurane anaesthesia. Design and methods: In this prospective randomized controlled study, 100 children undergoing oral surgery were randomly assigned to Group 1 which received ice popsicle after emergence (intervention, n = 50) or Group 2 which received verbal encouragement from their parents (control, n = 50). The primary outcome was the 2-hour postoperative incidence of EA. Results: Group 1 had a significant lower incidence of emergence agitation (22% vs 58%, P < 0.001) compared with Group 2. The mean agitation score was significantly lower in Group 1 vs Group 2 at 10 minutes (1.64 vs 2.12, P = 0.024) and 20 min (1.60 vs 2.14, P = 0.004) after emergence. The peak agitation and pain scores were significantly lower in Group 1 than in Group 2 (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Findings from this study suggest that ice popsicle is an effective, cheap, pleasurable, and easily administered method for alleviating emergence agitation in paediatric patients after oral surgery under general anaesthesia. These results are worthy of confirmation in other surgeries. Practice implications: This approach is highly accepted by both children and their parents, and our findings support the effectiveness of ice popsicle in relieving emergence agitation and pain after oral surgery in children.

Material and methods: Measurements of LAM activation asymmetry were performed during traction with the force of 5% body weight in two experimental conditions: 1) in neutral position, 2) in 20° posterior trunk inclination. Twenty-three healthy children with pelvic asymmetry participated in the study. To evaluate LAM activation asymmetry ultrasound technology was employed (two Mindray DP660 devices (Mindray, Shenzhen, China)). Activation asymmetry indices for each individual LAM were calculated. Results: The magnitude of LAM activation asymmetry indexes formed a gradient, with the most profound transversus abdominis (TrA) showing the greatest asymmetry, and the most superficial obliquus externus – the smallest. The inter-muscle differences were most pronounced between the TrA and the two more superficial oblique muscles. There were no correlation between the magnitude of pelvic asymmetry and LAM activation asymmetry. Conclusions: During the neurodevelopmental traction technique there is a difference in individual LAM activation symmetry, with deeper muscles showing greater asymmetry. The activation asymmetry of the LAM does not seem to be associated with the pelvic asymmetry. Results are similar to those recorded in earlier studies in samples where no pelvic asymmetry were subjected to analysis. © University of Physical Education, Warsaw, Poland.",Developmental asymmetry; Lateral abdominal muscles; Pelvis; Ultrasound,,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Evaluation and Improvement of Postural Balance and Muscle Strength

Perceptions of physiotherapists working in these high-pressure environments on person-centredness are currently unknown. A mixed methods exploration of person-centredness among ED physiotherapists targeted this knowledge gap to inform future clinical practice. Methods: Online survey and semi-structured interviews followed a convergent mixed methods design with sequential explanatory features. Data sets were analysed separately using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis, respectively, before merged analysis using joint display. Results: Twenty-six surveys and 11 in-depth interviews were completed. The three overarching themes of ED patients, ED physiotherapists, and ED environment were generated. Themes were integrated and analysed alongside quantitative survey findings. This produced three novel contributions that further our understanding of person-centred practices among ED physiotherapists. Conclusion: ED physiotherapists were mindful of an apparent, yet unspoken struggle between the competing philosophies of biomedicine and person-centredness. The results here support entering a patient’s world as a person-centred approach to help navigate the line between what an ED attender wants and the clinical need of their visit. © 2024 The Author(s).

Because sweat loss and electrolyte loss vary across individuals, conventional sweat testing strategies using absorbent patch techniques are employed in laboratory settings to characterize sweat biomarkers; however, these techniques are not suitable for remote environments. Here, an updated wearable microfluidic sweat testing system targeted for recreational athletes is presented that includes a microfluidic patch accommodating a broad range of sweating rates, and a smartphone app incorporating digital image processing algorithms to enable real-time analysis under different lighting conditions and patch orientations. Expansive field trials (n = 148 subjects) show significant correlations between the microfluidic patch and standard absorbent patch in measuring sweating rate and sweat chloride concentration during recreational exercise. This validation study demonstrates the applicability of the microfluidic patch and software platform for field testing in recreational athletes. © 2022 The Authors.

While patients who undergo aTSA return to sports at relatively high rates, individuals’ specific desired and achieved activities following aTSA remain poorly defined. Methods: A shoulder arthroplasty registry at a tertiary-care orthopedic hospital was reviewed retrospectively between February 1, 2016, and January 1, 2021, to identify specific patient activity and functional capabilities following aTSA at a minimum of 2 years postoperatively. Individual items and responses of the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons and Shoulder Activity Scale relating to activity levels, as well as free text responses pertaining to usual work and sport, were tabulated. Results: Among 597 patients who underwent 632 primary anatomic TSAs (mean age 65.9 ± 8.3 years, 41.5% female), the median American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score per affected limb improved from 40.0 (interquartile range (IQR) 27.4-54.7) preoperatively to 94.9 (IQR 83.8-98.3) at 2 years (P < .001), while median Shoulder Activity Scale improved from 8.0 (IQR 5.0-12.0) preoperatively to 10.0 (6.0-14.0) at 2 years (P < .001). Two years after surgery, 78.5%, 88.6%, and 83.5% of patients were able to comb their hair, manage toileting, and put on a coat without any difficulty, respectively. A relatively small proportion of patients were able to reach a high shelf (64.7%) and lift 10 pounds above the shoulder (57.4%) without difficulty. Of the 524 (82.9%) patients who returned to recreational activities 2 years after surgery, golf (25.6%), walking (22.7%), weight training (16.8%), and swimming (15.8%) were the most commonly reported activities. Cooking and cleaning (29.9%, n = 189), desk-related work (27.2%, n = 172), yard-work or gardening (14.2%, n = 90), heavy lifting activities (6.5%, n = 41), and grocery shopping (2.5%, n = 16) were the most common forms of usual work. Conclusion: Patients undergoing aTSA report a wide spectrum of desired recreational activities. A range of functional capabilities exists within this patient population with regards to usual sporting activity, work activity, and activities of daily living. Preoperative patient counseling may attempt to identify patients’ desired postoperative activities for more individualized education regarding their prognosis for returning to desired activities. © 2024 American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons",Activities of daily living Sports medicine; Clinical outcomes; Level IV; Physical fitness; Retrospective Case Series; Return to sport; Total shoulder arthroplasty,,"""Shoulder Joint Health and Rehabilitation: Arthroscopic Surgeries, Treatments and Outcomes""",Clinical Outcomes and Treatments in Shoulder Care,Shoulder Surgery Outcomes and Measures

Objective: To analyze the inclusion of biopsychosocial model domains in clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for RTS after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, as well as the quality of these CPGs. Study Design: Systematic review of CPGs. Level of Evidence: Level 1. Search Strategy: Two independent reviewers developed the search strategy, and a third reviewer corrected and compiled the developed strategies used. Data Sources: Ovid/Medline, Embase, and PEDro without restriction dates. Study Selection: CPGs for RTS after ACL injury at any age or sport level, and published in English. Data Extraction: Two independent reviewers codified the RTS criteria recommended in the CPGs according to the ICF domains, and the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II Checklist) was used for critical appraisal. Results: A total of 715 records were identified, and 7 CPGs were included. Frequency distribution of the biopsychosocial model domains was as follows: body functions (37.77%), activity and participation (20.00%), body structure (13.33%), environmental factors (11.11%), and personal factors (8.88%). In the AGREE II Checklist, the lowest mean domain scores were for rigor of development (37.86 ± 36.35) and applicability (49.29 ± 22.30), and 71.42% were of low or moderate quality. Conclusion: The CPGs cannot address the biopsychosocial model domains satisfactorily and some do not address all the ICF conceptual model components, emphasizing body functions and activity and participation domains. Therefore, the functioning model advocated by the World Health Organization has not yet been adequately incorporated into the recommendations for RTS after ACL injury. Moreover, most CPGs are of limited quality. © 2022 The Author(s).",ACL injury; AGREE II; biopsychosocial model; clinical practice guidelines; return to sport,"Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Checklist; Humans; Models, Biopsychosocial; Return to Sport; anterior cruciate ligament injury; checklist; human; psychology; return to sport","""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction and Outcome Factors

Methods: Patients with proximal ACL tears undergoing arthroscopic ACLPR with dual–suture anchor fixation were included in this time-zero clinical study. Laxity measurements were taken with a digital arthrometer to evaluate ATT stability preoperatively in the office (T0) as a standardized diagnostic tool, preoperatively under anesthesia (T1), at time zero intraoperatively after ACLPR but prior to SA fixation (T2), and after SA fixation (T3). Results: A total of 27 patients (mean age ± standard deviation [SD], 35.1 ± 12.0 years) with proximal ACL tears and significant preoperative (T0) ATT side-to-side differences (SSDs) (mean ± SD, 4.1 ± 1.5 mm) were evaluated. ACLPR was shown to restore ATT SSD at time zero (mean ± SD, 0.2 ± 1.1 mm) given that a significant reduction in ATT SSD (mean difference ± standard error, –4.7 ± 0.21 mm; P < .001) was achieved when comparing preoperative and intraoperative measurements after separate refixation of both ACL bundles with suture anchors. Additional SA fixation did not further decrease ATT when comparing measurements of the ipsilateral leg after ACL refixation and after SA fixation (mean difference ± SD, 0.03 ± 0.22 mm; P = .496). Conclusions: ACLPR with dual–suture anchor fixation restores time-zero ATT laxity in adults with proximal ACL tears. Additional SA fixation in full knee extension does not further decrease ATT. Clinical Relevance: This study provides important information about the effectiveness of ACLPR in restoring ATT. SA with the knee fixed in full knee extension does not further decrease ATT; therefore, augmentation may not lead to overconstraint of the knee or stress shielding of the repaired ACL. © 2024 Arthroscopy Association of North America",,,"""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction and Outcome Factors

This study aims to explore the association between physical capacity tests explored in the consultation and the level of disability in women with fibromyalgia. Methods: There were 484 women diagnosed with fibromyalgia who were evaluated with 7 physical capacity tests: 10-m walk, 2-minute walk, 5-repetition getting up from a chair and sitting (G&S), 30-second chair stand, monopodal balance (right and left), and up-and-go. Functional performance was assessed with the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQR). Evaluation of the association between the physical capacity tests and the FIQR was initially performed using a principal component analysis (PCA). Subsequently, agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) was performed in order to characterize groups of patients. Results: Results show than FIQR and the tests 10-m walk, 2-minute walk, 5-repetition G&S, 30-second chair stand, and up-and-go test were correlated. The results of the AHC determined 3 groups of patients mainly on one motor dimension with significant differences in both the FIQR and the physical capacity tests retained in the PCA (P < 0.001 for all). Conclusion: The application of these physical tests is simple, fast and can be a complement to the FIQR questionnaire when determining the level of disability of patients with fibromyalgia, in addition to providing information on the evolution of the patients when these tests are administered in the clinical consultation. © 2023 Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.",disability; fibromyalgia; mobility limitations; physical capacity,Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Fibromyalgia; Humans; Physical Examination; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Walking; 10-m walk; 2-minute walk; adult; agglomerative hierarchical clustering; Article; clinical evaluation; cluster analysis; consultation; controlled study; correlation analysis; cross-sectional study; diagnostic test; disability; disease association; female; fibromyalgia; gender; human; major clinical study; middle aged; physical capacity; physical disability; physical performance; principal component analysis; Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire; sensitivity analysis; up-and-go test; walking difficulty; fibromyalgia; physical examination; quality of life; questionnaire; walking,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Management and Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

Methods Sixty prostate cancer patients receiving ADT were randomly assigned to perform 20 wk of resistance exercise training with supplementation of 31 g whey protein (EX + PRO, n = 30) or placebo (EX + PLA, n = 30), consumed immediately after exercise and every night before sleep. A separate control group (CON, n = 36) only received usual care. At baseline and after 20 wk, body composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry), muscle mass (computed tomography scan), muscle strength (1-repetition maximum strength tests), physical performance (Timed Up and Go Test, 30-Second Chair Stand Test, and Stair Climb Test), aerobic capacity (cardiopulmonary exercise test), and habitual dietary intake (food diary) were assessed. Data were analyzed using a two-factor repeated-measures ANOVA. Results Over time, muscle mass and strength increased in EX + PRO and EX + PLA and decreased in CON. Total fat mass and fat percentage increased in EX + PRO and CON, but not in EX + PLA. Physical performance did not significantly change over time in either group. Aerobic capacity was maintained in EX + PLA, but it decreased in EX + PRO and CON. Habitual protein intake (without supplements) averaged >1.0 g·kg body weight-1·d-1, with no differences over time or between groups. Conclusions In prostate cancer patients, resistance exercise training counteracts the adverse effects of ADT on body composition, muscle mass, muscle strength, and aerobic capacity, with no additional benefits of protein supplementation.  © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Aerobic Capacity; Body Composition; Hormone Therapy; Physical Performance; Protein Supplementation,Androgen Antagonists; Androgens; Body Composition; Dietary Supplements; Exercise Therapy; Humans; Male; Muscle Strength; Muscles; Polyesters; Postural Balance; Prostatic Neoplasms; Resistance Training; Time and Motion Studies; androgen; antiandrogen; polyester; body composition; body equilibrium; controlled study; dietary supplement; human; kinesiotherapy; male; muscle; muscle strength; physiology; prostate tumor; randomized controlled trial; resistance training; task performance,"""Effects of Resistance Training and Physical Therapy Interventions on Strength, Fitness, and Health Conditions""",Resistance and Functional Training in Various Populations: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Walkability also affects physical activity. This study aimed to examine the effects of walkability on the physical activity of patients undergoing hemodialysis. Methods: This multicenter study included 372 outpatients (69.1 ± 11.9 years, 229 males) undergoing hemodialysis at eight facilities in Japan. Patients were classified into two groups according to the walk score (WS) at home: WS ≥ 50 (walkable area group) and WS < 50 (car-dependent area group). The effects of WS on total physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and walking that was assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) were examined. Results: In the multivariate analysis, WS ≥ 50 was positively associated with walking (β = 0.129, p = 0.013) and negatively associated with MVPA (β = −0.102, p = 0.045). Subgroup analysis stratified by the age of 65 years showed similar results in both groups. Conclusions: Walkability is associated with various intensities of physical activity in Japanese patients undergoing hemodialysis. Exercise management should take into account the characteristics of physical activity, depending on the residential area. Trial registration: UMIN, UMIN000050089.

There is no consensus on which modifiable injury risk metrics or performance screening tools to use to identify at risk collegiate baseball pitchers. Current literature on UCL injury risk has focused on local passive glenohumeral rotational motion with limited forays into more global movement patterns. The aim of this study was to assess possible relationships involving UCL injuries and modifiable local and global motor control performance risk factors. Material and Methods: An observational single cohort case series involving 15 collegiate baseball pitchers aimed to elucidate disparitites in glenohumeral active and passive range of motion alongside an assessment of general movement competency and dynamic motor control performance to identify injury risk for the UCL. Preseaon baseline metrics, including the Functional Movement Screen, Upper and Lower Quarter Y Balance Test, and glenohumaral internal and external rotation active, passive, and total arc range of motion were examined. Results: The two pitchers with UCL injury demonstrated less ability to actively move into their available passive rotational range with decreased lower extremity dynamic postural control, but no difference with general movement competency. The pitcher requiring UCL surgical intervention demonstrated even greater excessive passive range compared to the other injured pitcher and a decreased ability to control base of support during the dynamic single-leg balance performance test. Discussion: Participants with UCL injuries exibited noticable deficiencies in baseline active and passive mobility, suggestive of a potential motor control deficit and a compromised ability to fully access available range of motion. Furthermore, diminished performance on the Lower Quarter Y Balance Test identified potential motor control limitations involving a decreased ability to dynamically maintain a base of support. Conclusions: This is the first study designed to identify motor control issues in the both the local shoulder region and global body movement to identify modifiable risk factors for UCL injuries in baseball pitchers. This study may begin to address the gap in the literature by combining modifiable local shoulder range of motion and global balance metrics to identify pitchers at risk for UCL injuries. It underscores the significance of comparing active and passive range of motion in tandem with dynamic postural control assessments to better evaluate the risk of injuries in baseball pitchers. This case series lays the groundwork for future randomized clinical trials to evaluate the utiliity of combining this information. © JPES.","Collateral ligaments; Lower extremity; Postural balance; Range of motion, articular; Shoulder joint",,"""Muscle Strength, Endurance, and Injury Risk in Upper-Extremity Sports Performance""",Muscular Strength and Injury Risk in Athletes,Injury Risk and Performance in Athletes

The study identified how increased knee valgus, decreased knee flexion and poor landing patterns contribute as risk factors for these young athletes' anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. Methods: The present study utilized a quasi-experimental design. A total of 47 soccer players with poor landing mechanics were purposefully recruited and randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n=23 players, age=12.69±0.70 years, height=1.53±0.06 m, weight=49.91±6.76 kg) or the control group (n=24 players, age=12.55±0.64 years, height=1.51±0.08 m, weight=51.25±7.73 kg). The study measured Knee Valgus angle, Knee flexion angle, and LESS test scores at the baseline and the end of the 8-week study period. During the study, the intervention group used the Prevent Injury and Enhanced Performance (PEP) program as a warm-up routine, while the control group continued with their regular warm-up routine. The researchers used ANCOVA (Analysis of Covariance) and paired-sample t-test statistical analyses to evaluate the changes. Results: the intervention group significantly reduced knee valgus angle (P=0.001). Additionally, there were significant enhancements in knee flexion angle (P=0.003) and the LESS test scores (P=0.001). In contrast, the control group did not show significant improvements in knee valgus and knee flexion angles (P>0.05), except for LESS test scores (P=0.001), where they also demonstrated improvement. Moreover, the study found significant differences between the intervention and control groups in knee valgus angle (P=0.001), knee flexion angle (P=0.025), and LESS test scores (P=0.001). Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the PEP program effectively reduced dynamic knee valgus angles, increased knee flexion angles, and improved LESS test scores in young male soccer players. Therefore, it appears that this program can reduce the risk of ACL injuries in this population. © The Authors. Published by JRSR.

Early diagnosis of sarcopenia in nursing home residents and the identification of contributing factors would target interventions to reduce the incidence of malnutrition, social isolation, functional decline, hospitalization and mortality. Aim: Verify the prevalence and the degree of severity of sarcopenia according to the new EWSGOP2 criteria and to analyse its associated factors in residents living in nursing homes in Central Catalonia (Spain). Design: A cross-sectional multicenter study was conducted in 4 nursing homes. SARC-F test was applied as the initial screening, muscle strength was measured by a dynamometer, skeletal muscle mass by bioimpedance analysis and physical performance by Gait Speed. Four categories were used: total probable sarcopenia, probable sarcopenia, confirmed sarcopenia and severe sarcopenia. Results: Among the total sample of 104 nursing home residents (mean age 84.6, ± 7.8; median 86, IQR 110), 84.6% were women and 85 (81.7%) (95% confidence interval [CI] 73.0-88.0) had total probable sarcopenia, 63 (60.5%) had probable sarcopenia, 19 (18.3%) had confirmed sarcopenia and 7 (6.7%) had severe sarcopenia. In the bivariate analysis, obesity was negatively associated and total time in sedentary behavior positively associated with all sarcopenia categories. In addition, malnutrition and urinary continence were positively associated with total and probable sarcopenia. Urinary incontinence was a positive associated factor of total and probable sarcopenia. In the multivariate analysis, obesity represented a negative associated factor: OR = 0.13 (0.03 - 0.57), p = 0.007 and OR = 0.14 (0.03 - 0.60), p = 0.008 with total and probable sarcopenia, respectively, adjusted by urinary incontinence status. For confirmed sarcopenia, obesity also represented a negative associated factor OR = 0.06 (0.01 - 0.99), p = 0.049 and the total time in sedentary behavior a positive associated factor OR = 1.10 (1.00- 1.20), p = 0.040. Conclusions: According the EWGSOP2 criteria, high prevalence of sarcopenia was found in institutionalized older people, ranging from 6.7 to 81.7% depending on the category.

While osteopenia was once considered an older disease, it is now commonly seen in young individuals. The low bone density in the young population is alarming, leading to demands to improve physical activity. The study aims to de-termine the effectiveness of high impact exercise among young females with osteopenia. Methods. A quasi-experimental study was conducted in the out-patient department of Jinnah Sindh medical university among forty-five females aged 18 to 30 years, with osteopenia. The participants were enrolled through convenience and a purposive sampling technique. A training program involving high impact exercise was given for 4 weeks following an initial screening using a DEXA scan. The outcome was measured with the pre-and post-intervention of an exercise program on bone mass density (BMD), body mass index (BMI) and body fat percentage (BFP). Results. At the end of the four weeks, BMI, BMD and BFP showed significant improvements (p < 0.05). The BMD was improved from –1.95 to –1.89. It was found that BMD was significantly associated with age (0.04). Conclusions. Our study confirmed that the bone health of young females needs special attention to avoid osteoporosis in the future. The high impact exercises did show significant improvements through training, but additional studies are required on a larger scale. © Wroclaw University of Health and Sport Sciences.",body fat percentage; body mass index; bone mineral density; high impact exercise; osteopenia,adult; age; Article; body fat percentage; body mass; bone density; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; clinical outcome; controlled study; convenience sample; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; exercise; female; human; osteopenia; outpatient department; physical activity; purposive sample; quasi experimental study; resistance training; young adult,"""Physical Activity, Rehabilitation, and Health Outcomes in Medical Conditions""",Impact of Exercise and Rehabilitation on Quality of Life and Health in Patients,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

However, there is currently no excellent cure for it. Cognitive-exercise dual-task intervention (CEDI) is a promising method to improve ARCI, while the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the onset, development, and rehabilitation of ARCI. This study aimed to investigate the effects of CEDI and the role of regulation of the lncRNA NEAT1/miR-124–3p on the caveolin-1-PI3K/Akt/GSK3β pathway in CEDI improving cognitive function. Forty 18-month-old natural aging rats were randomly assigned to four groups: exercise training group, cognitive training group, CEDI group, and aging control group, and underwent 12 weeks of intervention. A novel object recognition test was performed to determine cognitive function, and the hippocampus was separated three days after the behavioral tests for further molecular detection. In an in vitro study, the mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line HT22 was cultured. MiR-124–3p and lncRNA NEAT1 were over-expressed or down-expressed, respectively. The expressions of related proteins, lncRNA, and miRNA were examined by WB and/or qRT-PCR. The results showed that compared with the aging control group, the CEDI group had a higher discrimination index, and significantly decreased the expressions of lncRNA NEAT1, and the protein expressions of caveolin-1 and p-GSK3β, while significantly increased the expressions of miR-124–3p, and the protein expressions of p-PI3K and p-Akt. Inhibition of the lncRNA NEAT1 could significantly increase the protein expressions of p-PI3K and p-Akt in HT22 cells. Upregulation of miR-124–3p decreased the protein expressions of caveolin-1 and p-GSK3β, and increased the protein expressions of p-PI3K and p-Akt significantly. Inhibition of miR-124–3p had the opposite effects. Our study demonstrated that CEDI improved cognitive function in aging rats better than a single intervention.

Multiple tissues can generate a patient’s complaint of pain, such as the skin, muscle, ligaments, tendon, nerves, and bones. Regarding the somatosensory system, inflammation around the nerve can create pain and alter movement coordination; this information has resulted in increased awareness of neurodynamic assessments and exercises. Neurodynamic assessments and exercises provide a unique paradigm to effectively assess and treat neural tissue, which may not commonly be considered within the traditional orthopedic examination. Clinical Question: In college athletes with musculoskeletal pain and activity impairments, does the use of neurodynamic exercises improve pain or function? Summary of Key Findings: Of the 5 studies, all consisted of chronic injuries with 3 involving upper-extremity pathologies and 2 focusing on lower-extremity pathologies. All 5 studies noted short- and long-term improvement following the incorporation of neurodynamic sliders or tensioners into the treatment plan. Four of the studies had follow-up periods greater than 30 days with sustained improvement on patient outcomes. Only 2 studies described a progression of neurodynamic exercises through sliders and tensioners. Three studies utilized a set/repetition format for exercise prescription, whereas a fourth used a time-based format, and a fifth article utilized both. Finally, 4 studies utilized neurodynamic assessments to identify whether there was a neural component to the patient’s presentation (eg, peripheral nerve mechanosensitivity). Clinical Bottom Line: In individuals with musculoskeletal impairments, evidence exists to support the use of neurodynamic exercises, such as sliders and tensioners, to improve pain and pain-related disability when neural sensitivity exists. Strength of Recommendation: Grade C evidence exists to support the use of neurodynamic exercises in college athletes with a musculoskeletal impairment. © 2022 Human Kinetics, Inc.",nerve glides; nerve tensioners; neural mobilization,Athletes; Disabled Persons; Exercise Therapy; Humans; Musculoskeletal Pain; Upper Extremity; athlete; disabled person; human; kinesiotherapy; musculoskeletal pain; physiology; procedures; upper limb,"""Pain Management and Musculoskeletal Health in Various Populations""",Chronic Pain Management and Treatment Studies,Muscle Strength and Recovery in Sports Performance

The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which time spent sitting at work is associated with the one-year prevalence of MSCs in the neck, shoulder, upper back/thoracic spine, and lower back among workers from the Study of Mental Health in the Workplace (S-MGA). In addition, the study also examined whether leisure time, physical activity, and sex modify the relationship between occupational sitting and MSCs. Methods: For this analysis, we used the S-MGA, a 5-year prospective study in Germany. The S-MGA is a nationwide representative employee cohort study with a baseline survey in 2012 and a follow-up survey in 2017. Sitting at work was measured using a question asked at baseline. The Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire was used to determine the one-year prevalence of MSCs in the neck, shoulder, upper back, and lower back pain (yes/no). The assessment of MSCs was only conducted at the 2017 follow-up. Adjusted Poisson regression models were used to determine the association of baseline level of weekly hours spent sitting at work with MSCs during follow-up. In addition to unadjusted models, models were adjusted for demographic (age, sex, body mass index and occupational skill level), occupational (heavy lifting at work), psychological disorders and lifestyle factors (smoking status and leisure time physical activity), as well as preexisting musculoskeletal conditions reported at baseline. To examine whether the relationship between sitting time and pain was modified by sex and leisure time physical activity, the models were stratified for both these variables. Results: Among the participants analyzed (n = 2,082), 49.8% were male, while 50.2% were female, and more than 60% of the study population spent over half of their working hours in a sitting position. Exposure to increased sitting at work reported at baseline was not consistently associated with 12-month prevalence of MSCs in the upper body at follow-up. However, differences in the association between occupational sitting and MSCs were dependent on the intensity of leisure time physical activity. Prevalence ratios (PRs) indicated an increased prevalence of MSC in the neck (PR = 1.46; 95% CI = 1.18–1.80) and shoulder (PR = 1.30; 95% CI = 1.03–1.64) in workers without leisure time physical activity who spent 25 to < 35 weekly working hours sitting. Discussion: These findings suggest that leisure time physical activity interacts with the relationship between sitting at work and MSCs. The relationship between sitting at work and musculoskeletal pain needs further investigation, but we found indications that leisure time physical activity may counter the effects of sitting at work. © The Author(s) 2024.",Longitudinal studies; Musculoskeletal; Occupational sitting; Pain; Physical work; Sedentary,adult; Article; backache; biomechanics; body mass; cohort analysis; employee; female; follow up; German (citizen); Germany; groups by age; health survey; human; leisure; low back pain; major clinical study; male; mental disease; mental health; middle aged; musculoskeletal disease; neck pain; Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire; occupational health; physical activity; prevalence; sex; shoulder pain; sitting; smoking; workplace,"""Pain Management and Musculoskeletal Health in Various Populations""",Chronic Pain Management and Treatment Studies,Management and Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

However, there is limited research about how to implement those programmes and the perceived barriers and facilitators among end-users. Objective: To investigate perceptions of the IPEP Knee Control and facilitators and barriers to programme use among coaches and youth floorball players, and explore factors associated with planned maintenance of Knee Control. Methods: This cross-sectional study is a sub-analysis of data from the intervention group of a cluster randomised controlled trial. Perceptions about Knee Control and facilitators and barriers to programme use were evaluated with surveys pre-intervention and post-season. 246 youth floorball players aged 12–17 years, and 35 coaches that reported no use of IPEPs during the preceding year were included. Descriptive statistics and univariate and multivariate ordinal logistic regression models were undertaken with the dependent variables: coaches’ planned maintenance and players’ opinions of maintenance of Knee Control. Independent variables were perceptions, facilitators and barriers regarding use of Knee Control and other potential influencing factors. Results: 88% of the players believed that Knee Control can reduce injury risk. Common facilitators to Knee Control use among coaches were support, education and high player motivation, and common barriers were that injury prevention training was time-consuming, lack of space to execute the exercises and lack of player motivation. Players who planned to maintain use of Knee Control had higher outcome expectancies and belief in one’s ability to use Knee Control (action self-efficacy). Coaches who planned to maintain Knee Control had higher action self-efficacy and to a lesser extent considered that Knee Control takes too much time. Conclusions: Support, education, and high player motivation are key facilitators, while lack of time and space for injury prevention training and boring exercises are key barriers for coaches and players to use Knee Control. High action self-efficacy among coaches and players seems to be a prerequisite for maintained use of IPEPs. © 2023, The Author(s).",Athletic injuries; Implementation; Injury prevention; Neuromuscular training; Self-efficacy; Team sports,accident prevention; adolescent; Article; ball sport; ball sports athlete; child; cross-sectional study; education; exercise; female; floorball; human; juvenile; knee; male; motivation; self concept,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

However, there is a lack of evidence on the most effective feedback technique after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential difference in jump-landing techniques between IF and EF instructions in patients after ACLR. Methods: Thirty patients (12 females, mean age 23.26 ± 4.91 years) participated after ACLR. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups that each followed a different testing sequence. Patients performed a drop vertical jump-landing test after receiving instructions with varying types of focus of attention. The Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) assessed the jump-landing technique. Results: EF was associated with a significantly better LESS score (P < 0.001) compared with IF. Only EF instructions led to improvements in jump-landing technique. Conclusion: Using a target as EF resulted in a significantly better jump-landing technique than IF in patients after ACLR. This indicates that increased use of EF could or might result in a better treatment outcome during ACLR rehabilitation. © 2023 The Author(s)",Anterior cruciate ligament; Attentional focus; Jump-landing technique; Rehabilitation,Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Attention; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cross-Over Studies; Female; Humans; Young Adult; adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; article; attention; clinical article; controlled study; female; human; male; outcome assessment; potential difference; randomized controlled trial; rehabilitation; scoring system; young adult; adolescent; anterior cruciate ligament injury; attention; biomechanics; crossover procedure,"""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction and Outcome Factors

The aim of this study was to explore the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of African elite women football players, and their support personnel toward the menstrual cycle and menstruation. An anonymous questionnaire was distributed to all participants (n = 564) at two African women football tournaments. Ultimately, 238 women football players, 44 coaches, 18 health personnel, and 17 referees completed it. From 317 questionnaires analyzed, 17%, 27%, 56%, and 0% of players, coaches, health personnel, and referees, respectively, knew at least one menstrual cycle hormone; 91%, 95%, and 100% of players, coaches, and referees, respectively, did not know at least one menstrual cycle phase. Over 70% of health personnel believed that menstruation negatively affects women’s performance in sports compared with 36% of players; 18%, 28%, and 18% of players, health personnel, and referees, respectively, believed that, for convenience, the menstrual cycle should be changed by drugs like contraceptives; and 54%, 61%, 62%, and 40% of players, coaches, health personnel, and referees, respectively, were confident providing advice about the menstrual cycle to teammates. Minimal knowledge of the menstrual cycle has implications on the development of menstrual cycle considerate training environments and educational materials in African women’s football. Furthermore, the relatively low perceived effect of the menstrual cycle on sporting performance and belief in the use of contraceptives may be attributable to differences in community-level religiocultural and social contexts which influence menstrual experiences, and shape behavioral expectations. © 2024 University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG).",Africa; athletes; female; period; soccer,,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

METHOD International published recommendations were followed for the translation and cross-cultural adaptation process. A total of 120 patients (mean age ±SD=48.5±15.33 years, 56 women and 64 men) with RCRP completed the Greek versions of the Short-WORC, Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire and Rand-36 Item Health Survey. A total of 112 patients filled out the Greek versions of the Short-WORC twice and were included the in test-retest reliability analysis. RESULTS One linguistic discrepancy was identified and adapted in the Greek language. The Greek version of the Short-WORC showed an acceptable face and content validity. The questionnaire presented a high internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha= 0.84). The test-retest reliability was excellent suggesting an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.94 (95% confidence interval: 0.90–0.96). The standard error of measurement and minimal detectable change were found to be 5.6% and 15.6%, respectively. No ceiling or floor effects were identified. There was a strong correlation between the Greek versions of the Short-WORC and DASH (r=0.71), and a weak to moderate correlation between the Greek version of the Short-WORC and the Rand-36 Item Health Survey (r=0.30–0.59). CONCLUSIONS The Greek version of the Short-WORC is an applicable, reliable, and valid self-reported outcome measure of health-related quality of life in patients with RCRP. Further research investigating the responsiveness of the questionnaire would be valuable for its future clinical use. © Athens Medical Society.",Outcome measures; Psychometric properties; Questionnaire; Rotator cuff; Shoulder pain; WORC,,"""Shoulder Joint Health and Rehabilitation: Arthroscopic Surgeries, Treatments and Outcomes""",Clinical Outcomes and Treatments in Shoulder Care,Shoulder Surgery Outcomes and Measures

A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov databases, from inception to December 2021. Eligibility criteria consisted of randomised control trials (RCT’s) involving maximal-intent resistance training (MIRT), where participants (aged 60+) had specific instruction to move ‘as fast as possible’ during the concentric phase of the exercise. Twelve studies were included within the meta-analysis. Divided into functional capacity and strength-related outcomes; Improvements were evident for timed-up-and-go (p = 0.001, SMD: − 1.74 [95% CI − 2.79, − 0.69]) and knee extension one-repetition maximum (1RM) (p = 0.01, SMD: − 1.21, [95% CI − 2.17, − 0.25]), both in favour of MIRT, as well as in 30 s sit-to-stand in favour of T-STR (p = 0.04, SMD: 3.10 [95% CI 0.07, 6.14]). No statistical significance was found for combined functional capacity outcomes (p = 0.17, SMD: − 0.84, [95% CI − 2.04, 0.37]), with near-significance observed in strength-related outcomes (p = 0.06. SMD: − 0.57, [95% CI − 1.16, 0.02]) favouring MIRT. Heterogeneity for FC-outcomes was observed as Tau2 = 4.83; Chi = 276.19, df = 14, I2 = 95%, and for strength-outcomes Tau2 = 1.290; Chi = 109.65, df = 115, I2 = 86%. Additionally, MIRT elicited substantial clinically meaningful improvements (CMI) in Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) scores but fell short of CMI in 400 m walk test by 0.6 s. In conclusion, this systematic review highlights the lack of sufficient and quality evidence for maximal- versus submaximal-intent resistance training on functional capacity and strength in community-dwelling older adults. Study limitations revolved around lack of research, low quality (“low” PEDro score), and largely due to the fact many comparison studies did not match their loads lifted (1500 kg vs. 500 kg), making comparisons not possible. © 2022, The Author(s).",Ageing; Resistance training; Sit to stand; SPPB; Timed up and go,aged; aging; article; Cinahl; Cochrane Library; community dwelling person; eligibility criteria; exercise; female; functional status; human; human experiment; knee; male; Medline; meta analysis; PEDro; randomized controlled trial (topic); resistance training; short physical performance battery; statistical significance; systematic review; timed up and go test; walk test; Web of Science,"""Effects of Resistance Training and Physical Therapy Interventions on Strength, Fitness, and Health Conditions""",Resistance and Functional Training in Various Populations: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

To determine potential factors affecting the outcome over a 6-month follow-up. Materials and methods: Within a 2-year period, 149 consecutive patients with AC were prospectively enrolled and allocated into (i) group-CR, including 39 patients receiving hydrodilatation of the glenohumeral joint (GHJ) with capsular rupture and (ii) group-CP, including 110 patients treated with GHJ hydrodilatation with capsular preservation. Demographics, affected shoulder, and AC grade were recorded. Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire and visual analog scale (VAS) were used for clinical assessment at baseline/1/3/6 months. Comparisons were performed with Mann-Whitney U test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Linear regression was used to identify predictors of outcome. P value < 0.05 defined significance. Results: DASH and VAS scores in both groups improved significantly compared to baseline (P < 0.001) and were significantly lower in the CP compared to CR group at all time-points following intervention (P < 0.001). Capsule rupture was a significant predictor of DASH score at all time-points (P < 0.001). DASH scores correlated to initial DASH score at all time-points (P < 0.001). DASH/VAS scores at 1 month were correlated to the AC grade (P = 0.025/0.02). Conclusion: GHJ hydrodilatation results in pain elimination and functional improvement till the mid-term in patients with AC, with improved outcome when adopting the capsule-preserving compared to the capsule-rupturing technique. Higher initial DASH score is predictive of impaired functionality in the mid-term. © 2023, The Author(s).",Adhesive capsulitis; Capsular rupture; Frozen shoulder; Hydrodilatation; Predictor; Treatment/ultrasound-guided,"Bursitis; Humans; Range of Motion, Articular; Shoulder; Shoulder Joint; Treatment Outcome; Ultrasonography; Ultrasonography, Interventional; adult; aged; Article; capsule preserving ultrasound guided hydrodilatation technique; capsule rupturing ultrasound guided hydrodilatation technique; clinical feature; comparative effectiveness; Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (score); disease severity; female; follow up; functional status; human; humeroscapular periarthritis; major clinical study; male; musculoskeletal procedure; risk factor; treatment outcome; visual analog scale; bursitis; diagnostic imaging; echography; interventional ultrasonography; range of motion; shoulder; shoulder joint",Advancements in Therapies and Technologies for Osteoarthritis and Joint Disorders,Therapeutic Interventions and Their Efficacy in Osteoarthritis Treatment,Shoulder Surgery Outcomes and Measures

We hypothesize that arthroscopy training conducted on a virtual reality simulator will be preferred by orthopaedic surgery residents over a traditional dry lab simulation model. Methods: 38 orthopaedic surgery residents at a single U.S. residency program were randomized to train for a shoulder arthroscopy procedure using either a virtual reality simulator or a table-top dry lab simulator. Training and learning preferences were then asked of the resident participants. Results: Junior residents were likely to report training preference for the virtual reality simulator compared to senior residents [15/24 (62.5%) v. 8/14 (57.1%); P =.043]. Simulator preference was not influenced by subspecialty interest, prior arthroscopy experience, or simulator experience. Virtual reality simulation was associated with positive attitude towards arthroscopy and high chance of reporting learning gains on general arthroscopic understanding. Senior residents were 4.7 times more likely than juniors to report learning gains via staff discussion pre- and post-operatively. A majority of residents [34/38 (89.5%)] reported, however, wanting more simulation for training surgical skills. Conclusion: Simulation is a desired and potentially valuable adjunct to training orthopaedic residents in arthroscopy. Training needs do evolve; and junior arthroscopists may benefit more from virtual reality platforms for general skills. Senior residents preferred dry lab simulation, possibly because it allowed for handling of actual instruments and implants. © The Author(s) 2023.",arthroscopy; simulation training; surgical simulation; virtual reality,Arthroscopy; Clinical Competence; Computer Simulation; Humans; Internship and Residency; Orthopedics; Shoulder; Simulation Training; Virtual Reality; Article; burnout; human; learning; perception; shoulder arthroscopy; simulation; simulation training; skill; surgical training; virtual reality; arthroscopy; clinical competence; computer simulation; controlled study; medical education; orthopedics; randomized controlled trial; shoulder; simulation training,"""Virtual Reality and Exergames in Rehabilitation and Exercise""",Virtual Reality Interventions in Motor Rehabilitation and Sports for Older Adults,Shoulder Surgery Outcomes and Measures

The objective of the present study was to assess the validity and reliability of muscle volume measurements for all hamstring muscle heads and gracilis (GR), as well as tendon volume for the semitendinosus (ST) and GR using freehand 3-D US. Methods: Three-dimensional US acquisitions were performed for 13 participants in two distinct sessions on separate days, in addition to one session dedicated to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Volumes of ST, semimembranosus (SM), biceps femoris short (BFsh) and long (BFlh) heads, and GR muscles and from the tendon from semitendinosus (STtd) and gracilis (GRtd) were collected. Results: The bias and the 95% confidence intervals of 3-D US compared with MRI ranged from –1.9 mL (–0.8%) to 1.2 mL (1.0%) for muscle volume and from 0.01 mL (0.2%) to –0.03 mL (–2.6%) for tendon volume. For muscle volume assessed using 3-D US, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) ranged from 0.98 (GR) to 1.00, and coefficients of variation (CV) from 1.1% (SM) to 3.4% (BFsh). For tendon volume, ICCs were 0.99, and CVs between 3.2% (STtd) and 3.4% (GRtd). Conclusion: Three-dimensional US can provide a valid and reliable inter-day measurement of hamstrings and GR for both muscle and tendon volumes. In the future, this technique could be used as an outcome for strengthening interventions and potentially in clinical environments. © 2023 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology",3-D freehand ultrasound; Gel pad; Hamstring; Magnetic resonance imaging; Muscle; Reliability; Tendon; Validity; Volume,"Hamstring Muscles; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Reproducibility of Results; Tendons; Ultrasonography; Muscle; Reliability; Tendons; Ultrasonic imaging; Volume measurement; 3-D freehand ultrasound; 3-D ultrasound; Biceps femoris; Freehand ultrasound; Gel pad; Hamstring; Muscle volume; Three-dimensional ultrasound; Validity; Volume; adult; article; biceps femoris muscle; clinical article; controlled study; correlation coefficient; female; gracilis muscle; hamstring muscle; hamstring tendon; human; human experiment; male; muscle mass; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; reliability; semitendinous muscle; three dimensional echography; validity; diagnostic imaging; echography; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; reproducibility; tendon; three-dimensional imaging; Magnetic resonance imaging","""Achilles Tendinopathy and Musculoskeletal Ultrasound Studies in Sport Medicine""",Achilles Tendon Health & Rehabilitation Research,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Method: This is a quantitative study supported by descriptive and inferential statistics. The following collection instruments were used: Bruininks-Oseretsky Motor Proficiency Test and Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment - Middle Childhood. Results: The analyses indicated the influence of environmental constructs on the development and maintenance of children's motor competence, elucidating the fact that the appropriate home environment is a protective factor for the development of this competence. Children residing in adequate homes were 66% more likely to have motor competence on average. Another fact highlighted was due to the disparity in the level of motor competence between the sexes, with emphasis on the fact that girls aged 9-10 years who live in households classified as unsuitable, located in the central region of the city, studying in public schools presented motor competence values below the expected for their age. Conclusion: The sociodemographic profile of children who presented the best chances for higher motor proficiency included boys aged 6-7 years old, living in households classified as adequate, located in neighborhoods outside the central region, and studying in private schools. © 2023 Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos.

Multiple studies have reported considerably faster visuomotor responses and expertise-related intrinsic brain activity changes among table tennis players compared with matched controls. However, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. Herein, we performed static and dynamic resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) analyses of 20 table tennis players and 21 control subjects using 7T ultra-high field imaging. We calculated the static and dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) of the two groups. The results revealed that table tennis players exhibited decreased static ALFF in the left inferior temporal gyrus (lITG) compared with the control group. Voxel-wised static functional connectivity (sFC) and dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analyses using lITG as the seed region afforded complementary and overlapping results. The table tennis players exhibited decreased sFC in the right middle temporal gyrus and left inferior parietal gyrus. Conversely, they displayed increased dFC from the lITG to prefrontal cortex, particularly the left middle frontal gyrus, left superior frontal gyrus-medial, and left superior frontal gyrus-dorsolateral. These findings suggest that table tennis players demonstrate altered visuomotor transformation and executive function pathways. Both pathways involve the lITG, which is a vital node in the ventral visual stream. These static and dynamic analyses provide complementary and overlapping results, which may help us better understand the neural mechanisms underlying the changes in intrinsic brain activity and network organization induced by long-term table tennis skill training.

Up to now (as of May 2022), approx. 514 million people worldwide have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, in Germany this affects approx. 25 million. In Germany, 2.5 million people could potentially be affected by post-COVID syndrome. Post-COVID is thus a highly relevant public health issue. So far, there is no specific causal therapy for the post-COVID syndrome, but with multimodal symptom-oriented rehabilitation, the course can be favourably influenced. However, there is no study yet that focuses on patients in different rehabilitation indications and compares the focal symptomatology and coping strategies as well as the patients' benefit per indication. Methods/design: As first objective, pulmonal, cardiac, neurological, cognitive or/and psychological functional impairments in rehabilitation patients after COVID-19 disease will be described. The second objective is the differentiated review of the specific rehabilitation measures, in the short term and in the longer term for the purpose of future prognoses and optimisation of therapeutic interventions. This prospective, non-randomised, controlled longitudinal study, plus multi-group comparisons will take place in seven rehabilitation clinics of different specialisations: cardiological rehab, pneumological rehab, neurological rehab, psychosomatic rehab. Within 12 months, 1000 cases across all participating centres will be included. Somatic and psychological testing will be conducted at three measurement points: Admission (t0), discharge (t1), 6-montas Catamnesis (t2). The patients receive the usual care according to the respective rehabilitation priorities, adapted to the special challenges of post-COVID symptoms. Patients of the post-COVID outpatient clinic without rehabilitation will be used as a control group. Discussion: This study will precisely assess the extent to which subclinical neurological or/and psychological impairments are present in post-COVID-19 rehabilitation and the results will help, developing, providing and evaluating appropriate treatment concepts. This may also have relevant implications for the improvement of physical ability and quality of life in post-COVID-19 patients and increase the probability of return to work.

Women are the most sedentary group of workers, and women working in an office are thus at a high risk for lower back pain. This study was focused on evaluating the effectiveness of compensatory postural training for vertebrogenic disorders in a sample of sedentary women. The study involved four women, who all engaged in sedentary work, with an average age of 53 ± 1.75 (N = 4). The primary objective was to address the challenges associated with vertebrogenic disorders, including limited mobility and associated pain. A targeted movement program was designed as an intervention, incorporating specific exercises derived from the Animal Flow concept. This program aimed to positively impact spine mobility, enhance muscle chain functionality and ultimately alleviate the painful symptoms associated with vertebrogenic disorders. The intervention spanned 6 months. A comprehensive input diagnosis was conducted before initiating the intervention. This involved assessing spinal mobility using non-invasive Spinal Mouse technology. Additionally, the impact of pain on daily life was evaluated using The Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale, and overall quality of life was measured using the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire. After the 6-month intervention, output diagnostics were performed, and the results were evaluated. The findings affirm the effectiveness of the exercise program for considerably improving spine mobility, and we found an improvement in spinal mobility in the frontal and sagittal planes. Using the Animal Flow program, we found improvements in sleep-related activities, long-term sitting or standing, walking, carrying heavy loads and painful symptoms associated with vertebrogenic disorders. © JPES.",Animal Flow; Compensatory exercise; Sedentary women; Spinal disorders; Spinal mouse,,"""Balance, Mobility, and Fall Risks in Aging and Musculoskeletal Conditions""",Impact and Control of Chronic Low Back Pain and Balance in Older Adults,Management and Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

Due to this lack of data and the significant need of athlete-specific mental health screening tools, a continuous mental health monitoring program for elite Para athletes was implemented. Objective: Validation of the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) as a suitable tool for continuous mental health evaluation in elite Para athletes. Design: A 43-week prospective observational cohort study. Setting: Online questionnaire, provided weekly via web browser and mobile app. Participants: Seventy-eight Para athletes preparing for Paralympic Summer and Winter Games. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Weekly PHQ-4 scores, stress level, and mood. Results: With a mean weekly response rate of 82.7% (SD = 8.0), 2149 PHQ-4, 2159 stress level and 2153 mood assessments were completed. Mean PHQ-4 score among all participating athletes was 1.2 (SD = 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], [1.1–1.3]). Individual weekly scores ranged from 0 to 12 and showed significant floor effects, with 54% of the scores being zero. PHQ-4 scores were significantly higher among female athletes and team sport members (p <.001). Internal consistency of the PHQ-4 was satisfying, Cronbach's α being 0.839. There were significant cross-sectional as well as longitudinal correlations of PHQ-4 and stress level as well as mood values (p <.001). 39.7% of all athletes (n = 31) had at least one positive screen for mental health symptoms. Conclusions: The PHQ-4 was shown to be a valid tool for mental health surveillance in elite Para athletes. Significant correlations of the PHQ-4 and stress level as well as mood were shown. High weekly response rates among participating athletes indicated good acceptance of the program. The weekly monitoring allowed for the identification of individual fluctuations and could identify potential athletes at risk for mental health problems when combined with clinical follow-up. © 2023 The Authors.

Results: A total of 554 elite athletes (professional or national level) were included (median age 22 years, 72.0% male). An electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram and exercise test were performed in 551 (99.5%), 497 (89.7%) and 293 (52.9%) athletes, respectively. We found anomalies with a potential link with SARS-CoV-2 infection in four ECGs (0.7%), three echocardiograms (0.6%) and three exercise tests (1.0%). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 34 athletes (6.1%), mostly due to abnormal first-line examinations, and was abnormal in one (2.9%). The rates of those abnormalities were not higher among athletes with cardiac symptoms or more severe forms of non-hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infection. Only one athlete had a possible SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis and sport was temporally contraindicated. None had a major cardiac event declared during the follow-up. Conclusion: The proportion of cardiac involvement after non-hospitalized forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in athletes are very low. Systematic cardiac screening before returning to play seems to be unnecessary. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS",Athletes; Myocarditis; Return-to-play; SARS-CoV-2; Screening,Adult; Athletes; COVID-19; Female; Heart; Humans; Male; Myocarditis; SARS-CoV-2; Young Adult; troponin; adolescent; adult; Article; asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019; athletics; basketball; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; cardiovascular symptom; cardiovascular system examination; child; combat sport; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; cycling; diarrhea; disease severity; echocardiography; electrocardiogram; electrocardiography monitoring; elite athlete; exercise test; fatigue; female; follow up; gymnastics; handball (sport); headache; heart injury; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart palpitation; heart repolarization; heart ventricle arrhythmia; human; major clinical study; male; medical record review; myalgia; myocarditis; patient referral; pericardial effusion; polymerase chain reaction; protein blood level; retrospective study; return to sport; rhinorrhea; rugby; screening; soccer; swimming; T wave inversion; team sport; thorax pain; triathlon; ventricular noncompaction; athlete; diagnosis; epidemiology; heart; myocarditis; young adult,"""Impacts of COVID-19 on Physical and Mental Health, Exercise Habits, and Rehabilitation Strategies""","Impact of COVID-19 on Health, Physical Activity and Quality of Life",Post-COVID-19 Syndrome and Rehabilitation Strategies

Methods: We induced osteoarthritis in male Sprague-Dawley rats by intra-articular injection of sodium iodoacetate into the right rear knee joint. The animals with lesions were divided into an untreated group and an LED-treated group (n=7 each). In the LED-treated group, the lesioned knee was irradiated with lasers (850 and 940 nm) and dose (3.15 J/cm2 ) for 20 minutes per session, twice a week for 4 weeks. Knee joint tissues were stained and scanned using an in vivo micro-computed tomography (CT) scanner. Serum interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-18 levels were determined using enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay. Several functional tests (lines crossed, rotational movement, rearing, and latency to remain rotating rod) were performed 24 hours before LED treatment and at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after treatment. Results: LED-treated rats showed improved locomotor function and suppressed matrix-degrading cytokines. Micro-CT images indicated that LED therapy had a preserving effect on cartilage and cortical bone. Conclusion: LED treatment using wavelengths of 850 and 940 nm resulted in significant functional, anatomical, and histologic improvements without adverse events in a rat model. Further research is required to determine the optimal wavelength, duration, and combination method, which will maximize treatment effectiveness. © 2023 by Korean Academy of Rehabilitation Medicine",Inflammation; Knee; Osteoarthritis; Phototherapy; Rats,,Advancements in Therapies and Technologies for Osteoarthritis and Joint Disorders,Therapeutic Interventions and Their Efficacy in Osteoarthritis Treatment,Efficacy and Safety of Different Treatments for Osteoarthritis

We determined the relationship between Twitter use of different sources and number of citations across all journals and within each individual journal, any statistical differences in citations and AAS for tweeted vs nontweeted articles, and the correlation between journal impact factor and average number of monthly tweets. We included 2916 articles in our study, at an average of 26 months after publication. The mean AAS was 9.7 (SD, 45.1; range, 0-1125), and mean citation rate was 6.4 (SD, 8.5; range, 0-166). Impact factor was strongly correlated with average monthly tweets (r2=0.77). Tweeted articles received 8.51 citations on average, compared with 2.56 citations for nontweeted articles (P<.05). Tweets sent by the author/department had the highest impact on future citations (P<.01). Tweets by news outlets had a smaller, positive effect on citations (P<.01).

Symptomatic osteoarticular defects continue to be a formidable challenge for the clinical and scientific communities alike. Of the various surgical treatment options that have been proposed to this end, only osteochondral grafting techniques reliably restore appropriate hyaline tissue in acquired articular cartilage lesions, especially when these involve the subchondral bone. Both autologous and allogeneic graft sources are available to the surgeon, who must consider the unique qualities and characteristics of either approach in the treatment algorithm. Autografts and allografts alike adhere to a common methodology, relying on osseous healing of mature osteochondral constructs to transplant the adherent viable articular cartilage. The required surgical technique is straightforward and reproducible but requires precision to restore articular surface congruity, achieve reliable bony ingrowth, and, ultimately, clinical success. Scientific investigation to further validate empirical clinical practice and to improve implant quality and safety is ongoing and holds great promise for the future of osteochondral grafting in joint preservation. © 2023 The Authors",Mosaicplasty; OAT; Osteochondral allografts; Osteochondral autograft,Article; articular cartilage; autotransplantation; bone allograft; bone growth; bone lesion; chondrocyte implantation; clinical outcome; clinical practice; clinical protocol; human; mosaicplasty; nonhuman; osteoarthropathy; patient safety; postoperative care; reproducibility; subchondral bone; treatment indication,"""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Hip Arthroscopy Outcomes and Rehabilitation

To build an investment case for adolescent injury prevention, evidence is needed as to effective interventions. Methods: A systematic review of peer-reviewed original research published between 2010–2022 was conducted. CINAHL, Cochrane Central, Embase, Medline and PsycINFO databases were searched for studies reporting the effectiveness of unintentional injury prevention interventions for adolescents (10–24 years), with assessment of study quality and equity (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, socio-economic status). Results: Sixty-two studies were included; 59 (95.2%) from high-income countries (HIC). Thirty-eight studies (61.3%) reported no aspect of equity. Thirty-six studies (58.1%) reported prevention of sports injuries (commonly neuromuscular training often focused on soccer-related injuries, rule changes and protective equipment). Twenty-one studies (33.9%) reported prevention of road traffic injury, with legislative approaches, commonly graduated driver licensing schemes, found to be effective in reducing fatal and nonfatal road traffic injury. Seven studies reported interventions for other unintentional injuries (e.g., falls). Discussion: Interventions were strongly biased towards HIC, which does not reflect the global distribution of adolescent injury burden. Low consideration of equity in included studies indicates current evidence largely excludes adolescent populations at increased risk of injury. A large proportion of studies evaluated interventions to prevent sports injury, a prevalent yet low severity injury mechanism. Findings highlight the importance of education and enforcement alongside legislative approaches for preventing adolescent transport injuries. Despite drowning being a leading cause of injury-related harm among adolescents, no interventions were identified. Conclusion: This review provides evidence to support investment in effective adolescent injury prevention interventions. Further evidence of effectiveness is needed, especially for low- and middle-income countries, populations at increased risk of injury who would benefit from greater consideration of equity and for high lethality injury mechanisms like drowning. © 2023 The Author(s)",Adolescence; Cost-benefit; Evaluation; Injury; Morbidity; Mortality; Risk,Accidental Injuries; Adolescent; Athletic Injuries; Automobile Driving; Drowning; Humans; Licensure; Accident prevention; Accidents; Cost benefit analysis; Diseases; Roads and streets; Sports; Adolescence; Cost/benefit; Evaluation; Injury; Injury prevention; Morbidity; Mortality; Sports injuries; Systematic Review; Unintentional injuries; accidental injury; adolescent; car driving; drowning; human; licensing; sport injury; Economics,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Hybrid assistive limb (HAL) technology, which integrates an interactive biofeedback system connecting the musculoskeletal system to the brain and spinal motor nerves, offers a potential intervention. Our study, conducted from March 2018 to August 2023 using knee HAL single-joint technology, was a prospective non-randomized controlled trial involving 27 patients who had undergone arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. They were split into two groups: HAL (18 patients) and control (nine patients). Beginning 18 weeks after their surgery, the HAL group participated in three weekly sessions of knee HAL-assisted exercises. Both the HAL and control groups underwent isokinetic muscle strength tests at postoperative weeks 17 and 21. Testing utilized an isokinetic dynamometer at 60°/s, 180°/s, and 300°/s. The Limb Symmetry Index (LSI) was employed to measure side-to-side differences. The HAL group showed significant LSI improvements in peak extension torque across all testing velocities and for peak flexion torque at 60°/s and 300°/s. The rate of change in LSI for peak flexion torque at 300°/s was significantly higher post-measurements (p = 0.036; effect size = 1.089). The change rate for LSI in peak extension torque at 300°/s and all peak flexion torques showed medium to large effect sizes in Cohen’s d. In conclusion, knee HAL single-joint training positively influenced muscle strength recovery and efficiency. The HAL training group exhibited superior muscle strength at various isokinetic testing velocities compared to the control group. © 2023 by the authors.",ACL reconstruction; isokinetic muscle strength; knee HAL single-joint training,adult; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; arthroscopic surgery; Article; clinical article; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; cryotherapy; female; human; isokinetic exercise; Limb Symmetry Index; Lysholm score; male; muscle contraction; muscle strength; neuromuscular electrical stimulation; physical performance; postoperative period; prospective study; range of motion; rehabilitation care; resistance training; scoring system; Tegner activity score; torque; velocity; young adult,"""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Advancements and Outcomes of Knee Arthroplasty and Rehabilitation Techniques

This study aimed to compare eight weeks of functional training and traditional resistance on the bio-motor capacities of elite female taekwondo athletes. Methodology: Seventeen elite taekwondo athletes (mean age = 21.7 years, mean height = 167.2 cm and mean weight = 60.8 kg) volunteered to participate in the study. They were randomly divided into two groups: functional training (FT) and traditional resistance training (TRT). Participants trained for 8 weeks, 3 sessions per week, for 75–90 min. Aerobic power, anaerobic power, speed, reaction time, agility, muscle power, dynamic balance, flexibility, upper and lower body muscle strength, core and upper body muscle endurance, and blood lactate level were measured before and after training programs. Results: Non-significant differences were observed in all indicators between the FT and TRT groups (P > 0.05). Both groups showed significant improvement in time-related outcomes except for fatigue and flexibility (P > 0.05). There was significant progress in both groups in aerobic power, muscle power, speed, agility, reaction time, lower body strength, upper body strength, dynamic balance of the right leg, and dynamic balance of the left leg indices from pre to post-tests. The FT group displayed significant improvement in peak power (P = 0.006) and mean power (P = 0.015) from pre- to post-test. Conclusion: Both interventions improved most biomotor abilities in elite female taekwondo athletes.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional survey-based study disseminated to a consortium of expert orthopaedic surgeons in the management of anterior cruciate ligament injuries. The survey was a 27-question, multiple choice–style questionnaire with question topics ranging from demographic characteristics and practice characteristics to surgeon-specific pain management strategies in the postoperative period after ACLR. Specific topics of interest included the use of preoperative opioid education and/or counseling sessions, implementation of standardized pain management regimens, use of pain tracking systems, and use of any adjunct non-narcotic analgesic modalities. Results: A total of 34 completed surveys were collected, representing a 73.9% response rate. Over 85% of respondents reported prescribing opioids as a standardized postoperative regimen after ACLR. Surgeons reported prescribing 5- to 10-mg doses, with the tablet count ranging anywhere from fewer than 10 tablets to more than 20 tablets, often instructing their patients to stop opioid use 2 to 4 days postoperatively. Prescribed dosages remained stable or decreased over the past 6 months with increased use of non-narcotic adjuncts. Only one-third of respondents reported using standardized preoperative opioid counseling, with even fewer discussing postoperative discontinuation protocols. Conclusions: Over 85% of respondents prescribe opioids as a standardized postoperative regimen after ACLR, with only 15% providing non-narcotic pain regimens. However, prescribed dosages have remained stable or decreased over the past 6 months with increased use of non-narcotic adjuncts. Only one-third of respondents use standardized preoperative opioid counseling, with even fewer discussing postoperative discontinuation protocols. Clinical Relevance: The ongoing opioid epidemic has created an urgent need to identify the most effective pain management strategies after orthopaedic procedures, especially ACLR.

Materials and methods: We conducted a Delphi survey involving clinicians, researchers, decision makers, and patients. Before the survey, we presented the results of an overview of systematic reviews summarizing the evidence on prognostic factors related to post-concussion symptoms. Results: After two rounds, the 17 experts reached consensus on the inclusion of 12 prioritization criteria: acute stress disorder, anxiety and depression, baseline mental and physical health, functional impacts and difficulties in performing daily habits after the trauma, motivation to receive services, multiple concussions, prior neurological problems, PTSD, quality of sleep, return to work failures, somatic complaints, suicidal ideation. Conclusion: Healthcare stakeholders must consider a wide range of factors to guide clinical decision-making, including about access to care and patient prioritization. This study shows that the Delphi technique can be used to reach consensus on such decisions regarding patients with mTBI who are waiting for outpatient specialized rehabilitation services. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",concussion; consensus; criteria; Delphi; Prioritization; prognostic,Anxiety; Brain Concussion; Delphi Technique; Humans; Post-Concussion Syndrome; Systematic Reviews as Topic; acute stress disorder; adult; anxiety disorder; Article; clinical decision making; collaborative care team; comprehension; concussion; consensus; consensus development; controlled study; convenience sample; decision making; Delphi study; depression; e-mail; emergency ward; female; human; major clinical study; male; mental health; occupational therapist; outpatient; physiotherapist; postconcussion syndrome; posttraumatic stress disorder; practice guideline; prognosis; questionnaire; rehabilitation center; return to work; sleep quality; suicidal ideation; traumatic brain injury; anxiety; brain concussion; postconcussion syndrome; systematic review (topic),"""Physical Activity and Rehabilitation in Adults with Neurological Conditions""",Physical Activity and Rehabilitation Post-Injury,Post-Concussion Symptoms and Recovery in Adolescents

They are prone to misalignments caused by simplified joint mechanics and incorrect fit or positioning. Those misalignments are a common safety concern as they can cause undesired interaction forces. However, the exact mechanisms and effects of misalignments on the joint load are not yet known. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the influence of different directions and magnitudes of exoskeleton misalignment on the internal knee joint forces and torques of an artificial leg. Methods: An instrumented leg simulator was used to quantify the changes in knee joint load during the swing phase caused by misalignments of a passive knee brace being manually flexed. This was achieved by an experimenter pulling on a rope attached to the distal end of the knee brace to create a flexion torque. The extension was not actuated but achieved through the weight of the instrumented leg simulator. The investigated types of misalignments are a rotation of the brace around the vertical axis and a translation in anteroposterior as well as proximal/distal direction. Results: The amount of misalignment had a significant effect on several directions of knee joint load in the instrumented leg simulator. In general, load on the knee joint increased with increasing misalignment. Specifically, stronger rotational misalignment led to higher forces in mediolateral direction in the knee joint as well as higher ab-/adduction, flexion and internal/external rotation torques. Stronger anteroposterior translational misalignment led to higher mediolateral knee forces as well as higher abduction and flexion/extension torques. Stronger proximal/distal translational misalignment led to higher posterior and tension/compression forces. Conclusions: Misalignments of a lower leg exoskeleton can increase internal knee forces and torques during swing to a multiple of those experienced in a well-aligned situation. Despite only taking swing into account, this is supporting the need for carefully considering hazards associated with not only translational but also rotational misalignments during wearable robot development and use. Also, this warrants investigation of misalignment effects in stance, as a target of many exoskeleton applications. © 2022, The Author(s).",Exoskeletons; Joint load; Joint misalignments; Rehabilitation; Safety,"Biomechanical Phenomena; Exoskeleton Device; Humans; Knee Joint; Leg; Range of Motion, Articular; Torque; abduction; adduction; Article; compression; equipment design; hysteresis; rotation; standing; tension; torque; biomechanics; exoskeleton (rehabilitation); human; joint characteristics and functions; knee; leg",Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Methods: Data were obtained from the Swedish National Knee Ligament Registry. Two study groups were created: (1) index ACL reconstruction (ACL group) and (2) index PCL reconstruction (PCL group). Between-group differences were investigated using Fisher’s exact test and Fisher’s non-parametric permutation test for dichotomous variables and continuous variables, respectively. Results: Of 39,010 patients, 38,904 were ACL injuries. A larger proportion of patients with combined injuries to the PCL, meniscus and cartilage were female, aged > 25 years and with a BMI of > 35 kg/m2 compared with patients with combined injuries to the ACL, meniscus and cartilage. An isolated ACL injury was more commonly found in males, while all other injury profiles of ACL, including combined injuries with meniscus, cartilage and collateral ligament injuries, were more frequently observed in females. The PCL injuries were sustained either during pivoting sports, non-pivoting sports or were traffic-related. Conclusion: Different patient characteristics (BMI, age and sex), and activities at the time of injury (sport- versus traffic-related activities), resulted in distinct injury profiles for the ACL and PCL groups. These findings provide valuable information of the way specific injury patterns of cruciate ligament injuries occur, and subsequently may help clinicians with the diagnostic process of ACL and PCL injuries.

However, EVA mouthguards are problematic, for example inconsistent thicknesses across the mouthguard. Additive manufacturing provides a promising solution to this problem, as it can manufacture mouthguards with a greater precision. This paper compares the energy dissipation of EVA, the current material used for mouthguards, to various designs of a 3D printed material, some of which contain air cells. Impact testing was carried out at three different strain rates. The Split-Hopkinson bar was used for medium and high strain rate tests, and an Instron test rig was used for low strain rate testing. The best performing design dissipated 25% more energy than EVA in the medium and high strain rate testing respectively while the low strain rate testing was inconclusive. This research has shown that additive manufacturing provides a viable method of manufacturing mouthguards. This opens up the opportunity for embedding electronics/sensors into additive manufactured mouthguards. © 2022, The Author(s).",,"Equipment Design; Materials Testing; Mouth Protectors; Printing, Three-Dimensional; equipment design; materials testing; mouth protector; three dimensional printing",Advancements in Therapies and Technologies for Osteoarthritis and Joint Disorders,Therapeutic Interventions and Their Efficacy in Osteoarthritis Treatment,Advances in Tissue Regeneration and Healing in Musculoskeletal Disorders

Materials and methods design: In this parallel-group non-randomized clinical trial, 41 adults with persisting PCS were allocated to the in-clinic (n = 30) or telerehabilitation (n = 11) program. The outcome measures, which included the Post-Concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS; primary outcome), Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) for neck pain and headache and three disability questionnaires, were collected at baseline, weeks 6, 12, and 26.

This is the first described case of BFR training used in the rehabilitation of a patient with lower limb ischaemia. Material and Methods: The patient, undertaking frequent physical activity, a previous cigarette smoker, with a history of deep vein thrombosis, was diagnosed with occlusion of the popliteal and anterior tibial arteries causing intermittent, short-distance claudication. An invasive approach was not possible, as the patient refused any vascular surgery interventions, open or endo-vascular. Due to recently diagnosed hip joint degeneration, accompanied by degeneration and dyscopathy of the lumbosacral vertebral column, regular supervised walking training could not be implemented. Experimental blood flow restricted low-in-tensity training, with the use of a cross-trainer tool accompanied by cooling, was introduced. The 21-minute training, 3 times per week for 3 months, was performed in a seated position with a special low-pressure cuff placed on the arms and legs. Results: The patient’s limb symptoms were promptly reduced and the vascular parameters significantly improved, allowing surgical treatment of the right hip joint. The patient continued the non-invasive treatment for peripheral arterial disease in the form of walking training. Conclusions: Blood flow restriction training may be individually considered for patients with peripheral arterial disease hav-ing limited possibilities of classic walking training and revascularization, but this should be done with great caution and after detailed consultation with a vascular medicine specialist. © AWF Krakow.",blood flow restricted training (BFRT); intermittent claudication; peripheral arterial disease,,"""Effects and Applications of Blood Flow Restriction in Exercise Rehabilitation and Performance Enhancement""",Blood Flow Restriction Therapy in Low-Resistance Rehabilitation Exercises,Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation in Osteoarthritis Patients

To achieve a high level of performance and conform to cultural expectations regarding an athletic body type, female athletes often restrict their diets, which can lead to eating disorders. In addition to factors related to the sports environment, adolescent athletes are subject to changes caused by the maturation process. Therefore, the same factors may have different effects on eating disorder risk among adolescent and adult athletes. This study examined the relationship between eating disorder risk, specific aspects of the sports environment (sport type, level of competition [national and international], and training background), and individual aspects (body satisfaction and body mass index) in two groups of athletes: adolescents and adults. Methods: The sample included 241 highly trained female athletes aged 12–30 years (M = 20.68, SD = 4.45) recruited from different sports clubs in Poland. The subgroup of adolescents consisted of 82 athletes, while the number of adult athletes was 159. The Eating Attitudes Test questionnaire was used to assess the eating disorder risk among the athletes. Body satisfaction was measured using the Feelings and Attitudes Toward Body Scale incorporated into the Body Investment Scale. Results: Eating disorder risk was prevalent among 14.6% of the adolescent and 6.9% of the adult athletes. Significant associations between eating disorder risk and the studied variables were noted only among adolescent athletes. Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the occurrence of eating disorder risk was associated with participation in lean non-aesthetic sports (OR = 11.50, 95% CI: 3.58–37.09). Moreover, eating disorder risk was associated with athletes’ lower body satisfaction (OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.70–0.92). Body mass index was not included in the final regression model. Conclusions: The study indicated that eating disorder risk in adolescent female athletes was related to sport type and body satisfaction. The findings showed that, in adolescent athletes, eating disorder risk was the most associated with practicing lean non-aesthetic sports. Coaches and athletes should be aware that eating disorder risk increases among individuals with a lower body image. © 2023, The Author(s).",Aesthetic; Ball sports; Body image; Eating disorders; Non-aesthetic; Young athletes,adolescent; adult; Article; athlete; athletic performance; ball sport; basketball; body dissatisfaction; body height; body image assessment; Body Investment Scale; body mass; body weight; comparative study; dancing; Eating Attitudes Test; eating disorder; endurance sport; Feelings and Attitudes Toward Body Scale; female; gymnastics; hockey; human; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; patient satisfaction; physical performance; regression model; swimming; taekwondo; training; univariate analysis; volleyball,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Injury Risk and Performance in Athletes

TAA has been associated with complications, including wound persistence, periprosthetic osteolysis, infection, and implant failure, which can be attributed to the area's poor vascularization and soft-tissue quality. In particular, the anterior compartment - solely supplied by the anterior tibial artery – explains the heightened risk of poor outcomes in ankle surgery. The effect of a secondary reconstructive procedure, such as a skin graft or a muscle flap for prosthesis salvage, has been well described in the literature. Muscle flaps are indicated in soft tissue reconstructive procedures because they provide a reliable blood supply and significant tissue volume where there is dead space. Here we outline a case where a 53-year-old male patient received a gracilis muscle free flap after TAA to improve outcomes and as an alternative orthoplastic procedure for patients who otherwise would undergo limb amputation. After several months of physical therapy, the patient is pain-free and active. With this, it can be concluded that a free muscle flap has the potential to be used perioperatively in higher-risk patients to improve TAA outcomes and as an alternative to other procedures that can reduce a patient's quality of life, such as ankle arthrodesis or amputation. © 2023 The Authors",Ankle replacement; Case report; Limb salvage; Muscle free flap; Orthoplastic surgery; Total ankle arthroplasty,nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; adult; ankle arthritis; ankle arthrodesis; ankle arthroplasty; ankle replacement; Article; case report; cauterization; clinical article; debridement; free tissue graft; general anesthesia; gracilis muscle; high risk patient; human; intensive care unit; knee pain; limb amputation; limb salvage; male; middle aged; muscle flap; pain; physiotherapy; quality of life; range of motion; skin graft,"""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

The purpose of this study was to explore the ability of Kohonen neural network self-organizing maps (SOM) to objectively characterize movement patterns during sidestepping and their association with injury risk. Further, the network’s sensitivity to detect limb dominance was assessed. The data of 67 athletes with a total of 613 trials were included in this study. The 3D trajectories of 28 lower-body passive markers collected during sidestepping were used to train a SOM. The network consisted of 1247 neurons distributed over a 43 × 29 rectangular map with a hexagonal neighbourhood topology. Out of 61,913 input vectors, the SOM identified 1247 unique body postures. Visualizing the movement trajectories and adding several hidden variables allows for the investigation of different movement patterns and their association with joint loading. The used approach identified athletes that show significantly different movement strategies when sidestepping with their dominant or non-dominant leg, where one strategy was clearly associated with ACL-injury-relevant risk factors. The results highlight the ability of unsupervised machine learning to monitor an individual athlete’s status without the necessity to reduce the complexity of the data describing the movement. © 2024 The Author(s).

However, there is a lack of understanding of the emotional drivers of fear and how fear beliefs are formed. This study qualitatively explored the contextual and emotional underpinnings of fear and how these beliefs were formed, with reference to the Common-Sense Model of Self-Regulation. Face-to-face online interviews were conducted with ACL-injured participants (n = 18, 72% female) with a mean age of 28 years (range 18–50 years). Participants were either 1 year post ACL reconstruction surgery (n = 16) or at least 1 year post injury without surgery (n = 2) and scored above average on a modified Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia. Four participants were playing state-level sport or higher. Five themes emerged describing factors contributing to fear: ‘External messages’, ‘Difficulty of the ACL rehabilitation journey’, ‘Threat to identity and independence’, ‘Socioeconomic factors’, and ‘Ongoing psychological barriers’. A sixth theme, ‘Positive coping strategies’, provided insight into influences that could reduce fear and resolve negative behaviors. This study identified a broad range of contextual biopsychosocial factors which contribute to fear, supporting the notion that ACL injuries should not be treated through a purely physical lens. Furthermore, aligning the themes to the common-sense model provided a conceptual framework conveying the inter-related, emergent nature of the identified themes. The framework provides clinicians with a means to understanding fear after an ACL injury. This could guide assessment and patient education. © 2023 by the authors.",anterior cruciate ligament; biopsychosocial; common-sense model (CSM); fear; qualitative,Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Fear; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Recovery of Function; Return to Sport; Sports; Young Adult; bone; conceptual framework; health care; health education; injury; model test; qualitative analysis; social behavior; sport; adult; anterior cruciate ligament injury; Article; biopsychosocial model; common sense model of self regulation; conceptual framework; controlled study; coping behavior; fear; female; health belief; human; major clinical study; male; patient education; qualitative analysis; reconstructive surgery; self regulation model; socioeconomics; sport; Tampa scale for kinesiophobia; thematic analysis; young adult; adolescent; anterior cruciate ligament injury; convalescence; fear; middle aged; psychology; return to sport; sport,"""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction and Outcome Factors

The purpose of this study was to determine the current frequency of these programs, as well as their association with range of motion, strength, velocity, injury, and utilization in high school baseball pitchers. Methods: This was a multicenter, prospective, community-based study including high schools from the Northeastern, Southeastern, Midwestern, and Western regions of the United States. Preseason pitchers were surveyed about their use of weighted ball velocity programs and history of injury. Preseason pitchers underwent standardized physical examinations and pitch velocity was measured. During a single high school season, pitch counts and injury incidence were prospectively collected. Results: In total, 115 pitchers were recruited, of whom 63% had participated in a weighted ball program. There were no differences in range of motion or strength between groups who used weighted balls and those who did not. Pitchers that utilized weighted ball programs demonstrated a higher average fastball velocity (114.26 vs. 106.22 km/h [71 vs. 66 mph]; P < .001) as well as peak fastball velocity (115.87 vs. 109.44 km/h [72 vs. 68 mph]; P = .001) compared to those that did not use weighted ball programs. Pitchers that utilized weighted ball programs were no more likely to be single-sport athletes (44%) than those who were multisport athletes (49%, P = .667). Within the group who had used a weighted ball program 29% (13/45) reported a history of injury and within the group who had not used a weighted ball program 25% (10/40) reported a history of injury (P = .687). As only a single injury occurred in the entire cohort, comparison of injury rates could not be completed. Conclusion: In this prospective study, the majority of high school pitchers reported using weighted ball programs to increase velocity, and these programs were associated with increased average and peak velocity compared to pitchers who did not use weighted ball programs. There were no significant differences in injury history between the 2 groups. Further study is necessary to understand the injury risk associated with weighted ball programs. © 2023 The Author(s)",Baseball; Level III; Multicenter Prospective Survey Study; Overhead; Pitching; Shoulder; Throwing; Weighted ball,adolescent; Article; athlete; baseball; cross-sectional study; dynamometry; grip strength; high school; high school student; human; human experiment; multicenter study; normal human; physical examination; prospective study; questionnaire; range of motion; risk assessment; shoulder injury; training; upper limb; Weighted ball velocity training,"""Muscle Strength, Endurance, and Injury Risk in Upper-Extremity Sports Performance""",Muscular Strength and Injury Risk in Athletes,Injury Risk and Performance in Athletes

Accounting for socioenvironmental factors reduces ethnic/race group differences in clinical and experimental pain. In the current study sample, we previously reported that in individuals with knee pain, ethnic/race group differences were observed in bilateral temporal lobe thickness, areas of the brain associated with risk for Alzheimer's disease, and related dementias. The purpose of the study was to determine if socioenvironmental factors reduce or account for previously observed ethnic/race group differences and explore if a combined effect of socioenvironmental risk and chronic pain severity on temporal lobe cortices is evident. Methods: Consistent with the prior study, the sample was comprised of 147 adults (95 women, 52 men), 45–85 years of age, who self-identified as non-Hispanic Black (n = 72) and non-Hispanic White (n = 75), with knee pain with/at risk for osteoarthritis. Measures included demographics, health history, pain questionnaires, cognitive screening, body mass index, individual- and community-level socioenvironmental factors (education, income, household size, marital and insurance status, and area deprivation index), and brain imaging. We computed a summative socioenvironmental risk index. Results: Regression analyses showed that with the inclusion of socioenvironmental factors, the model was significant (p <.001), and sociodemographic (ethnic/race) group differences were not significant (p =.118). Additionally, findings revealed an additive stress load pattern indicating thinner temporal lobe cortices with greater socioenvironmental risk and chronic pain severity (p =.048). Implications: Although individual socioenvironmental factors were not independent predictors, when collectively combined in models, ethnic/race group differences in bilateral temporal lobe structures were not replicated. Further, combined socioenvironmental risk factors and higher chronic pain severity were associated with thinner bilateral temporal lobes. © 2023 The Authors.

Studies show that mirror therapy can improve shoulder function in patients with a limited shoulder range of motion and shoulder pain. Here, this article reports the results of a randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of the mirror therapy on shoulder function in patients with breast cancer following surgical treatments. Methods: Totally, 79 participants were divided to two groups receiving active range-of-motion upper limb exercise based on the mirror therapy or active range-of-motion upper limb exercise respectively for 8 weeks. Shoulder range of motion, Constant-Murley Score, Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Questionnaire, Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia, Visual analog scale, and grip strength were measured at baseline (T0), 2 weeks (T1), 4 weeks (T2), and 8 weeks (T3). The effects of the intervention on shoulder function were analyzed in generalized estimation equation, from group, time, and the interactions between group and time based on the data from participants who completed at least one post-baseline observation Results: At least one post-baseline observation was performed by 69 participants (n=34 mirror group, n=35 control group). 28(82.35%) participants in the mirror group adhered to the exercise compared to 30(85.71%) in the control group. Generalized estimation equation model showed group had main effects on forward flexion (Waldχ²=6.476, P=0.011), with the Cohen’s d=0.54. The effects of the group on abduction, Constant-Murley Score, and Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Questionnaire were significant when fix the effects of the time. At 8 weeks, participants in the mirror group showed an improvement in abduction compared to the control group (P=0.005), the Cohen’s d was 0.70. At 8 weeks, participants in the mirror group had a higher Constant-Murley Score than control group (P=0.009), with Cohen’s effect size value of d=0.64. The mirror group showed a greater improvement on the Disability of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Questionnaire than control group at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks (P≤0.032), but with a weak effect size value of all (r≤0.32). Group had main effects on Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (Waldχ²=6.631, P=0.010), with the Cohen’s effect size value of d=0.56. Conclusions: Mirror therapy improved shoulder flexion, abduction, shoulder function in daily life, and arm function and symptom of the affected shoulder in patients with breast cancer following surgical treatment, while decreasing fear of movement/(re)injury. Mirror configuration needs to be improved in further research to increase its feasibility. Implications for Cancer Survivors: Breast cancer survivors can try mirror therapy as a practical and effective method in shoulder rehabilitation for a promotion on effects.

Latent profile analyses (LPA) of MM patients were used to identify profiles of patients with similar PAHCO and symptom burden. Analysis of variance was applied to investigate group differences in important covariates. N = 98 MM patients (57% male, age 64 ± 9 years) could be assigned to three distinct PAHCO profiles: 46% were patients with high PAHCO, 48% patients with moderate, and 5% were patients with low PAHCO. The mean probability to be assigned to a certain profile was over 99%. The first group showed significant higher physical activity (PA) and lower comorbidities. Regarding symptom burden, three different profiles exist, including group one (32% of patients) with very low symptom burden, profile two (40%) with medium symptom burden, and group three (15%) with very high symptom burden (mean probability ≥ 98%). Patients in profile one had a lower number of treatment lines compared to the other profiles. Patients who were assigned to the high PAHCO profile were more likely to display a milder symptoms profile. In this exploratory analysis, we identified different patient profiles for PAHCO and symptom burden that may be used to individualize exercise recommendations and supervision modalities in MM patients. PAHCO and symptom burden level may be used to stratify MM patients in order to provide more personalized and effective exercise counseling. The profiles require individualized exercise recommendations and different supervision modalities, including educational instructions tailored particularly to every patient’s needs, according to their PAHCO and symptom profile.

In modern humans, accurate throwing is an important skill required in many sports. However, the spatiotemporal coordination of muscles during baseball throwing has not been fully elucidated. We herein aimed to identify the muscle synergies involved in baseball throwing and determine whether their spatiotemporal patterns are shared among individuals. Ten college baseball players participated in this study. Electromyographic activity was recorded from 13 ipsilateral upper limb muscles during throwing using full effort. Non-negative matrix factorization was used to extract the motor module composition and temporal activation patterns during baseball throwing, followed by k-means analysis to cluster the extracted motor modules based on their similarity. Four motor modules were extracted for each player. These were classified into four clusters (Clusters 1–4), each reaching the peak activity sequentially from the early cocking phase to ball release. Spatiotemporal interindividual similarity in the muscle synergy cluster comprising the muscles activated during the transition from early cocking to late cocking (Cluster 2) was significantly lower than that in the other clusters. There was no individual-specific muscle synergy. These results suggest that the skilled baseball throwing motion acquired through years of practice may consist of four basic muscle synergies that are common among individuals with some differences in their spatiotemporal patterns. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Baseball; Muscle coordination; Muscle synergy; Non-negative matrix factorization,Baseball; Humans; Male; Muscles; Sports; Upper Extremity; Activation analysis; Baseball; Behavioral research; Matrix algebra; Mergers and acquisitions; Muscle; Human motor; Inter-individual differences; Motor behaviours; Motor modules; Muscle coordination; Muscle synergies; Nonnegative matrix factorization; Spatiotemporal patterns; Throwing motion; Upper limbs; adult; arm muscle; article; baseball; baseball player; human; male; motion; non-negative matrix factorization; muscle; sport; upper limb; Non-negative matrix factorization,"""Muscle Strength, Endurance, and Injury Risk in Upper-Extremity Sports Performance""",Muscular Strength and Injury Risk in Athletes,Injury Risk and Performance in Athletes

Methods: With institutional review board approval and informed consent, patients were prospectively enrolled into a registry to follow outcomes after OCA transplantation. Patients who received patellofemoral shell OCA to treat the entire articular surface of the patella, trochlea, or both, and with a minimum of 2-year follow-up data, including patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), failures, and complications, were included. Functional graft survival was determined based on patients returning to functional activities without need for OCA revision or arthroplasty surgery and calculated using the formula: 100% – (%revision + %failure). Minimum clinically important differences were determined based on previously validated data. Outcomes were compared based on differences in graft preservation methodology (Missouri Osteochondral Preservation System [MOPS] or standard preservation [SP]) and based on surfaces treated (patella, trochlea, or both). Results: Fifty-eight patients met inclusion criteria. Mean age was 36.7 years (range 15-60 years) and mean body mass index was 28.9 (range 18-42). OCAs stored using SP methods were transplanted in 12 patients, mean follow-up was (66.1 months; range 54-70 months): OCAs stored using MOPS methods were transplanted in 46 patients, mean follow-up was (44.8 months; range 24-60 months). Graft survival rate at final follow-up was significantly greater (P = .025) for MOPS OCAs (98%) compared with SP OCAs (75%), whereas 2-year functional graft survival rates (MOPS 98% vs SP 83%; P = .1) were not. Reoperation rate was significantly greater (P = .0014) for SP cases compared with MOPS cases. PROMs showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements through 4 years after unipolar patella, unipolar trochlea, and bipolar patellofemoral OCA transplantation using MOPS grafts. Unipolar patella OCA transplantations were associated with significantly more reduction in pain and significantly better PROMs at 1-year compared with unipolar trochlea and bipolar patellofemoral OCAs. Conclusions: OCA transplantation using MOPS shell grafts for unipolar and bipolar patellofemoral resurfacing was associated with statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements from preoperative levels of pain and function.

These devices are pieces of electronic equipment that can be worn as accessories, such as watches, or embedded in clothing, including gloves and sleeves, and could play an essential role in subjects' quality of life after any occurrence that affects their possibility to perform basic activities autonomously. Moreover, these devices can be used to improve manual performance tasks like surgical or precision tasks, and even more so when performed under extreme ambient temperature conditions. Goals and Methods: A SLR on upper-limb embedded devices was conducted based on scientific documents retrieved from the Scopus database. Two research questions were outlined: ""How has this technology been evolving?"" and ""What is the trend according to the fields of application?"". The combination of keywords (upper-limb* AND wearable* AND device*) was used in the title, abstract, and keywords fields. Results: A total of 555 documents were obtained. Descriptive statistical and bibliometric analyses were conducted, identifying trends, knowledge gaps, and the future direction of research. The free software VOSviewer was used to construct data visualization bibliometric maps of the co-authorship and co-citation network. A subset of 26 documents was considered for the critical qualitative synthesis. This step facilitated the visualization and exploration of the interconnectedness among authors and the citation patterns within the literature. Combining the information gathered enables addressing the extent and the emerging trends in upper-limb embedded devices' development according to the field they are applied. Final considerations: With this research, a starting point in developing a proof of concept of a novel device aimed at improving dexterity in challenging environments is established. © 2023, Ludomedia EN.

Many mental and physical abnormalities can cause noticeable differences in a person’s gait. Abnormal gait can lead to serious consequences such as falls, limited mobility and reduced life satisfaction. Gait analysis, which includes joint kinematics, kinetics, and dynamic Electromyography (EMG) data, is now recognized as a clinically useful tool that can provide both quantifiable and qualitative information on performance to aid in treatment planning and evaluate its outcome. With the assistance of new artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the traditional medical environment has undergone great changes. AI has the potential to reshape medicine, making gait analysis more accurate, efficient and accessible. In this study, we analyzed basic information about gait analysis and AI articles that met inclusion criteria in the WoS Core Collection database from 1992–2022, and the VosViewer software was used for web visualization and keyword analysis. Through bibliometric and visual analysis, this article systematically introduces the research status of gait analysis and AI. We introduce the application of artificial intelligence in clinical gait analysis, which affects the identification and management of gait abnormalities found in various diseases. Machine learning (ML) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) are the most often utilized AI methods in gait analysis. By comparing the predictive capability of different AI algorithms in published studies, we evaluate their potential for gait analysis in different situations. Furthermore, the current challenges and future directions of gait analysis and AI research are discussed, which will also provide valuable reference information for investors in this field.

Design: Cross-sectional national study. Subjects: A total of 3,220 adults with chronic low back pain from the 2017 Spanish National Health Survey. Methods: Three groups were defined according to physical activity level (low, moderate, and high) assessed with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Descriptive analysis and an ordinal regression model were performed. Results: Thirty percent of the subjects were classed as doing a low level of physical activity, 53% moderate, and 17% high. Females predominated in the low and moderate groups, and the subjects in the high group were younger. Subjects in the low group reported more use of pain-relief, more severe-extreme pain, more functional limitations, and worse quality of life and mental health. Factors more likely to be associated with higher levels of physical activity were: being male, normal body mass index or overweight, better health status, less pain, less physical and cognitive limitations, and more social support. Conclusion: Different aspects of the biopsychosocial framework were associated with the different levels of physical activity in subjects with chronic low back pain. These findings should be taken into consideration in order to establish suitable public health strategies. © 2023 Authors.

Methods: We developed a decision analytic model to compare the expected incremental cost and clinical consequences for a cohort of patients with FT RCT. The probabilities for healing or failure to heal (retear) were estimated from the published literature. Implant and healthcare costs were estimated from a payor's perspective in 2021 U.S. prices. An additional analysis included indirect cost estimations (e.g., productivity losses). Sensitivity analyses explored the effect of tear size, as well as the impact of risk factors. Results: The base case analysis demonstrated that resorbable bioinductive collagen implant + conventional rotator cuff repair results in incremental costs of $232,468 and an additional 18 healed RCTs per 100 treated patients over 1 year. The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is $13,061/healed RCT compared to conventional RCR alone. When return to work was included in the model, RBI + conventional RCR was found to be cost saving. Cost-effectiveness improved with tear size with the largest benefit seen in massive tears compared to large tears, as well as patients at higher risk of retearing. Conclusions: This economic analysis demonstrated that RBI + conventional RCR delivered improved healing rates at a marginal increase in costs when compared to conventional RCR alone and is, therefore, cost-effective in this patient population. Considering indirect costs, RBI + conventional RCR resulted in lower costs compared to conventional RCR alone and is, therefore, deemed to be cost saving.

However, malnutrition may be an essential factor affecting the effectiveness of exercise to improve physical function. Few studies of the relationship between malnutrition and the effectiveness of intradialytic exercise to improve physical function exist. Therefore, this study investigated malnutrition at the beginning of intradialytic exercise and how it affects the subsequent improvement in physical function. Methods: Patients who performed intradialytic exercise for 12 months were enrolled in this study. A Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index of 91.2 was defined as malnutrition. Patients were assigned to 2 groups using propensity score matching to adjust for confounding factors. Physical function outcomes were handgrip strength, isometric knee extension strength, short physical performance battery, and 10-m walking speed; these were compared at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. The 2 groups were further divided into another 2 groups as per whether the nutritional status had improved after 12 months; therefore, a total of 4 groups were analyzed. Results: After matching, the data of 154 patients in each group were analyzed. During the intragroup comparison, isometric knee extension strength, short physical performance battery, and 10-m walking speed improved significantly in both groups after intradialytic exercise was started compared with before intradialytic exercise was started. However, there was no significant improvement in handgrip strength in the malnutrition group. There were no significant differences in any of the physical function measurements or changes from the baseline values among the 4 groups divided as per subsequent recovery of the nutritional status. Conclusion: Malnutrition may not impact the effectiveness of intradialytic exercise to improve lower-leg physical function. Its effect on the improvement of handgrip strength requires further investigation. © 2022 The Authors",Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index.; Hemodialysis; intradialytic resistance exercise; malnutrition; physical performance,Aged; Exercise; Hand Strength; Humans; Malnutrition; Renal Dialysis; Resistance Training; aged; exercise; hand strength; hemodialysis; human; malnutrition; resistance training,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Methods: Maximum alpha angle measurements on magnetic resonance imaging and Hip2Norm standardized hip measurements on radiographs were recorded at baseline and at 12 months postoperatively. One-way analysis of covariance and independent T tests were conducted between participants who underwent arthroscopic hip surgery and physiotherapist-led non-surgical care. Independent T tests and analysis of variance were conducted between participants who underwent the 3 different arthroscopic hip procedures. Results: Arthroscopic hip surgery resulted in significant improvements to mean alpha angle measurements (decreased from 70.8° to 62.1°) (P value <.001, 95% CI −11.776, −4.772), lateral center edge angle (LCEA) (P value =.030, 95% CI −3.403, −0.180) and extrusion index (P value = 0.002, 95% CI 0.882, 3.968) compared to physiotherapist-led management. Mean maximum 1-year postoperative alpha angle was 59.0° (P value =.003, 95% CI 4.845, 18.768) for participants who underwent isolated cam resection. Measurements comparing the 3 different arthroscopic hip procedures only differed in total femoral head coverage (F[2,37] = 3.470, P =.042).

We aim to investigate their impact on cardiovascular health and white matter (WM) integrity and how they contribute to the cognitive benefits. Methods: 109 participants were recruited and 82 (62% female; age = 58.38 ± 5.47) finished the intervention with > 80% adherence. We report changes in cardiovascular risk factors and WM integrity (fractional anisotropy (FA); mean diffusivity (MD)), how they might be related to changes in physical activity, age and sex, and their potential role as mediators in cognitive improvements. Results: A decrease in BMI (SMD = − 0.32, p = 0.039), waist circumference (SMD = − 0.42, p = 0.003) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (SMD = − 0.42, p = 0.006) in the AE group and a decrease in BMI (SMD = − 0.34, p = 0.031) and DBP (SMD = − 0.32, p = 0.034) in the COMB group compared to the waitlist control group was observed. We also found decreased global MD in the CCT group (SMD = − 0.34; p = 0.032) and significant intervention-related changes in FA and MD in the frontal and temporal lobes in the COMB group. Conclusions: We found changes in anthropometric measures that suggest initial benefits on cardiovascular health after only 12 weeks of AE and changes in WM microstructure in the CCT and COMB groups. These results add evidence of the clinical relevance of lifestyle interventions and the potential benefits when combining them.

However, few studies have assessed the use of digital goniometry in paediatric populations and there are a limited number of studies that investigate any one device. The EasyAngle® is a digital goniometer that may be beneficial for use in pediatric settings as it requires only one hand to operate the device. Purpose The purposes of this study were 1) to establish the intra-rater and interrater reliability of the EasyAngle® digital goniometer in measuring hip joint ROM in healthy elementary school-aged children, and 2) to establish preliminary normative reference values for each year of age using the EasyAngle® for hip joint ROM in healthy elementary school-aged children. Study Design Descriptive Laboratory Study Methods Passive hip ROM (flexion, abduction, extension, internal rotation, external rotation) was measured on each leg of healthy participants using the EasyAngle®. A total of 40 hip joints were measured. Two blinded raters conducted three trials of each hip motion on both legs. Intrarater and interrater reliability of the recorded hip range of motion were calculated using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) (3,1). Results Twenty healthy children were measured (age 5-10, mean = 7.40 years old, SD = 1.37, 9 males, 11 females). Mean hip ROM was reported by age. Intrarater and interrater reliability were good to excellent for all hip ROM measurements (0.81-0.97 intra rater; 0.77-0.91 interrater).

This study aimed to conduct a detailed isokinetic assessment of the knee joint, focusing on both kicking and supporting legs, involving 24 football players from the university football team of SWU “Neofit Rilski”. The objective was to monitor the physiological and biomechanical characteristics of the thigh musculature. Isokinetic measurements of knee joint extensors (quadriceps) and flexors (hamstrings) strength were conducted bilaterally at angular velocities of 60, 180, and 300 °/s A comparative analysis included traditional parameters-peak torque (PT, Nm), average power (AP, W) and total work (TW, J)-together with additional parameters such as time to peak torque (TPT) and acceleration time (AcT). Conventional H/Q ratios were used for quadriceps and hamstring strength balance evaluation, and potential side-to-side strength deficits were calculated. Results indicated that the kicking leg (KL) demonstrated significant strength superiority (Wilcoxon, p < 0.05) compared to the supporting leg (SL). PT values in both antagonist groups were reduced when compared to those in other studies. Additionally, at low speeds (60 °/s), the time to PT was significantly prolonged, distinguishing these football players from their professional counterparts. Differences in time parameters, work capacity, and power at moderate velocity – 180o/s, were observed in both muscles’ groups, with the SL having lower values compared to the KL. At 60o/s and 300o/s the extensors of the SL had a longer time to reach AcT and TPT and a more reduced AP than the KL. The TW of Q and H is greater in the KL compared to the SL. The H/Q ratios between KL and SL, at all three measured speeds, fell below normal balance values, with nearly 75% of players exhibiting unilateral asymmetry in the KL and approximately 85% in the SL. This study provides evidence that a comprehensive isokinetic assessment, considering both traditional and additional parameters, is beneficial for university footballers. The findings revealed potential risks and susceptibility to noncontact knee injuries, offering valuable insights for the development of targeted training and therapy programmes. © JPES.",football players; hamstrings and quadriceps muscles; isokinetic; knee; strength,,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Effects of Training Protocols on Injury Prevention and Performance in Soccer and Futsal Players

Specifically, we aimed to review the implementation of motor imagery and action observation in the rehabilitation of lower limb injuries. Methods: This scoping review followed Arksey and O’Malley's framework and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension guidelines for scoping reviews checklist. The Medline (PubMed), Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched for controlled clinical trials published between 2010 and 2021 using key search terms. Primary articles were screened for inclusion based upon applying motor imagery and action observation as a rehabilitation protocol (independently or in combination) after sustaining an injury or undergoing surgery. Data were charted by extracting the exercise duration, frequency, and the number of weeks from the rehabilitative intervention protocols, and the measured clinical outcomes (pain, range of motion, muscle activity, and functional outcomes). Results: The initial database search resulted in 1367 articles, with 1352 excluded after screening, resulting in a total of 15 articles eligible for inclusion in the review. Six of the included articles included an action observation intervention, eight studies a motor imagery intervention, and a single study included combined motor imagery and action observation approach. The motor imagery and action observation techniques were able to improve clinical outcomes, including daily activity, functional movement, rage of motion, pain, and muscle strength. Conclusion: Motor imagery and action observation interventions may be effective to improve rehabilitative outcomes of lower limb injuries, thus its application should be considered alongside standard treatment protocols. © The Author(s) 2022.",action observation; lower limb injury; motor imagery; rehabilitation,"Activities of Daily Living; Humans; Imagery, Psychotherapy; Lower Extremity; Pain; Treatment Outcome; daily life activity; human; lower limb; pain; procedures; treatment outcome","""Pain Management and Musculoskeletal Health in Various Populations""",Chronic Pain Management and Treatment Studies,Wearable Devices and Techniques in Gait Analysis and Mobility Rehabilitation

CRF is associated with reduced self-reported physical function, but associations with objective measures of physical function are less robust. Exercise programs have been shown to improve both CRF and objective physical function, but the interaction of exercise, CRF, and function has not been explored. Methods: Retrospective data were collected from baseline (n = 420) and final assessments (n = 234) of survivors who participated in a 3-month clinical exercise program. Assessments included measures of CRF (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue) and physical function (6-minute walk test, usual and fast gait speed, 30-second sit-to-stand test, and the Timed Up and Go test). Multiple regression analyses investigated associations between CRF and physical function before and after the program. CRF and functional changes following the program were calculated and associations investigated with multiple regressions. Results: All measures of CRF and physical function significantly improved following the program (P <.01). CRF was associated with all functional measures at baseline (standardized β = -0.18 to 0.29, P <.01) and final assessments (r = -0.27 to 0.26, P <.01). Changes in CRF were associated with changes in function (standardized β = -0.12 to 0.23, P <.05), except usual gait speed (P =.17). Conclusion: This investigation demonstrated associations between CRF and objective physical function before and after participation in an exercise program. The 3-way interaction between CRF, physical function, and exercise can be used clinically to personalize rehabilitation strategies. Future studies should investigate changes in CRF and function during an exercise program. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Methods: A total of 721 patients were recruited from hip preservation clinics. The Optimal Screening for Prediction of Referral and Outcome–Yellow Flag Assessment Tool (OSPRO-YF) was used to identify the presence or absence of 11 different pain-associated psychological distress characteristics (yellow flags), while the International Hip Outcome Tool–12 (iHOT-12) was used to assess hip-related quality of life. Latent class analysis identified patient subgroups (phenotypes) based on naturally occurring combinations of distress characteristics. An analysis of variance was used to compare demographics, number of yellow flags, and iHOT-12 scores across phenotypes. Results: The median (interquartile range) number of yellow flags was 6 (3-9), with 13.5% of the sample reporting 11 yellow flags. Latent class analysis (L2 = 543.3, classification errors = 0.082) resulted in 4 phenotypes: high distress (n = 299, 41.5%), low distress (n = 172, 23.9%), low self-efficacy and acceptance (n = 74, 10.3%), and negative pain coping (n = 276, 24.4%). Significant differences in mean yellow flags existed between all phenotypes except low self-efficacy and negative pain coping. There were no differences in demographics between phenotypes. The high distress class had the lowest mean iHOT-12 score (mean [SD], 23.5 [17.6]), with significant differences found between each phenotypic class. Conclusions: There was a high prevalence of pain-associated psychological distress in patients presenting to tertiary hip arthroscopy clinics with hip pain. Furthermore, hip quality-of-life outcome scores were uniformly lower in patients with higher levels of psychological distress.

However, some studies consider body height (BH) as the most appropriate parameter. So, the aims of the present study were as follows: (1) determine which variable (BM or BH) provides a better normalization of the HGS in groups of judokas and non-judokas and (2) evaluate the HGS of these groups using the HGSindex based on normative values. Method: Participants were 84 male judoka (JM), 25 female judoka (JF), and 44 nonathlete males (NA). Using allometry, the HGS was normalized and the HGSindex was calculated. Statistical tests evaluated correlations, means, and effect sizes. Results: The results showed that JM and NA groups exhibited stronger HGS compared to nonathletes expected values, while the JF group showed similar performance. BM and BH were suitable variables for HGS normalization, even if BH did not significantly correlate with HGS in the JF group. Furthermore, normalizing HGS for BM removed the BH effect, but not vice versa. Individual HGSindex varied within the groups, ranging from superior to inferior. On average, the JM group had superior performance (HGSindex = 19.32%), while the JF (HGSindex = 6.19%) and NA (HGSindex = 13.61%) groups were classified as mean superior. Conclusion: The BM seems to be the best variable to normalize the HGS of the participants. The HGSindex proved to be a suitable tool, allowing for comparisons between groups that would not be possible with traditional allometric technique. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag Italia S.r.l., part of Springer Nature.",Adjustment; Allometry; Body height; Body mass; Measurement,,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Effects of different training methods on athletic performance and injury prevention

It is widely accepted that AFO's plantarflexion resistance affects sagittal knee moments during their gait. However, its effect on the coronal knee moment remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the effects of varying articulated AFO's plantarflexion resistance on knee adduction moment in people with chronic stroke.Methods:Ten people with chronic stroke participated in this study. Gait performance was measured using a Vicon 3-dimensional motion capture system and a Bertec split-belt instrumented treadmill. The participants walked on the treadmill wearing an articulated AFO whose plantarflexion resistance could be systematically adjusted. The ankle joints were set to four distinct levels of plantarflexion resistance (S1 < S2 < S3 < S4). The coronal ankle and knee joint moment, center of pressure, and ground reaction force were analyzed using Visual3D.Results:The external knee adduction moment increased significantly (P <.001) and the position of the center of pressure trajectory shifted significantly (P =.003) in the medial direction as the plantarflexion resistance of the AFO was increased from the least resistive condition (S1) to the most resistive condition (S4). The maximum knee adduction moment (median [interquartile range]) was S1: 0.097 (-0.012 to 0.265) Nm/kg; S2: 0.136 (0.040 to 0.287) Nm/kg; S3: 0.160 (0.465 to 0.289) Nm/kg; and S4: 0.192 (0.080 to 0.288) Nm/kg.Conclusions:This study demonstrated that varying AFO's plantarflexion resistance altered the knee adduction moment, likely by altering the center of pressure trajectory while walking, in people with chronic stroke. © 2022 SAGE Publications Inc..

Conceptual and nomological frameworks have described training load as a multidimensional construct manifested by two causally related subdimensions: external and internal training load. In this article, we explain how the concepts of training load and its subdimensions can be aligned to classifications used in occupational medicine and epidemiology, where exposure can also be differentiated into external and internal dose. The meanings of terms used in epidemiology such as exposure, external dose, internal dose and dose–response are therefore explored from a causal perspective and their underlying concepts are contextualised to the physical training process. We also explain how these concepts can assist in the validation process of training load measures. Specifically, to optimise training (i.e. within a causal context), a measure of exposure should be reflective of the mediating mechanisms of the primary outcome. Additionally, understanding the difference between intermediate and surrogate outcomes allows for the correct investigation of the effects of exposure measures and their interpretation in research and applied settings. Finally, whilst the dose–response relationship can provide evidence of the validity of a measure, conceptual and computational differentiation between causal (explanatory) and non-causal (descriptive and predictive) dose–response relationships is needed. Regardless of how sophisticated or “advanced” a training load measure (and metric) appears, in a causal context, if it cannot be connected to a plausible mediator of a relevant response (outcome), it is likely of little use in practice to support and optimise the training process. © 2023, The Author(s).",,Causality; Exercise; Humans; Sports; article; dose response; exercise; human; occupational medicine; outcome assessment; pharmacological science; training; validation process; validity; causality; sport,"""Analysis of Biomechanics, Exercise Techniques, and Physiological Adaptations in Various Physical Activities""",Lower Limb Muscle Strength and Biomechanics Studies,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

An objective, biological marker could improve recognition and understanding of SRC. There is emerging evidence that salivary micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) may serve as biomarkers of concussion; however, it remains unclear whether concussion-related miRNAs are impacted by exercise. We sought to determine whether 40 miRNAs previously implicated in concussion pathophysiology were affected by participation in a variety of contact and non-contact sports. Our goal was to refine a miRNA-based tool capable of identifying athletes with SRC without the confounding effects of exercise. Methods: This case-control study harmonized data from concussed and non-concussed athletes recruited across 10 sites. Levels of salivary miRNAs within 455 samples from 314 individuals were measured with RNA sequencing. Within-subjects testing was used to identify and exclude miRNAs that changed with either (a) a single episode of exercise (166 samples from 83 individuals) or (b) season-long participation in contact sports (212 samples from 106 individuals). The miRNAs that were not impacted by exercise were interrogated for SRC diagnostic utility using logistic regression (172 samples from 75 concussed and 97 non-concussed individuals). Results: Two miRNAs (miR-532-5p and miR-182-5p) decreased (adjusted p < 0.05) after a single episode of exercise, and 1 miRNA (miR-4510) increased only after contact sports participation. Twenty-three miRNAs changed at the end of a contact sports season. Two of these miRNAs (miR-26b-3p and miR-29c-3p) were associated (R > 0.50; adjusted p < 0.05) with the number of head impacts sustained in a single football practice. Among the 15 miRNAs not confounded by exercise or season-long contact sports participation, 11 demonstrated a significant difference (adjusted p < 0.05) between concussed and non-concussed participants, and 6 displayed moderate ability (area under curve > 0.70) to identify concussion. A single ratio (miR-27a-5p/miR-30a-3p) displayed the highest accuracy (AUC = 0.810, sensitivity = 82.4%, specificity = 73.3%) for differentiating concussed and non-concussed participants. Accuracy did not differ between participants with SRC and non-SRC (z = 0.5, p = 0.60). Conclusion: Salivary miRNA levels may accurately identify SRC when not confounded by exercise.

This is particularly problematic for athletes and may ultimately lead to reduced performance. This exploratory study investigated the feasibility of field-usable methods to objectively collect data relevant to sweat response in elite athletes with SCI. Differences in sweat response were also evaluated for different athlete characteristics. Methods: Measurements were performed during exercise and included core temperature (Tc), heart rate, urine specific gravity, fluid intake, sweat rate, and sweat electrolyte concentration. Differences for sex, lesion level (tetraplegia versus paraplegia), motor impairment (complete versus incomplete), and sport type (endurance versus team/skill) were evaluated. Results: Fifteen athletes (median (Q1–Q3) age, 30 (28–36) years; three females; 11 with complete lesions) were included. Endurance athletes were measured during indoor performance tests (n = 10), whereas team/skill athletes were measured during training sessions (n = 5). In the mixed exercise intensities, the average Tc was 37.7 (37.3–37.8) °C and the average heart rate was 126 (100–146) bpm. Dehydration, defined as a urine specific gravity > 1.020 ng/mL, was prevalent in six athletes before exercise and in five athletes after exercise. The sweat rate was lower in athletes with tetraplegia (p = 0.02) and in team/skill athletes (p = 0.008). Conclusions: Collecting sweat and thermal response data from athletes with SCI in the field is feasible. Given the suboptimal hydration status of many athletes, raising awareness of the importance of hydration seems valuable. © 2024 by the authors.",exercise; hydration; para-athlete; Paralympics; paraplegia; tetraplegia; thermoregulation,,"""Physical Activity, Rehabilitation, and Health Outcomes in Medical Conditions""",Impact of Exercise and Rehabilitation on Quality of Life and Health in Patients,Spinal Cord Injury and Exercise Rehabilitation

Studies on weightbearing GM exercises that can be used earlier in rehabilitation is limited. Utilizing GM isometric contraction and load transmission to thoracolumbar fascia during trunk straightening under unilateral stance, we for the first time describe Wall Touch Single Limb Stance (WT-SLS) exercise. Specific exercise prescription may be rationalised using knowledge of how upper and lower fibres of GM (UGM, LGM) respond during novel WT-SLS. Methodology: Surface EMG signals from UGM and LGM were compared among WT-SLS, Step up (SU) and Unilateral wall squat (UWS) in healthy subjects (N = 24). Raw data was normalized and expressed as percentage of maximum voluntary isometric contraction (%MVIC). Relative easiness in performing the exercises was scored using Borg's CR10 scale. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Results: WT-SLS had the highest %MVIC for both UGM and LGM (p < 0.0001), suggesting maximum activation of GM in healthy adults by our novel exercise. WT-SLS generated more motor unit action potentials, and had significantly greater activity for UGM than LGM (p = 0.0429). Remaining exercises had no differential activation of UGM and LGM. WT-SLS was perceived as only ‘slight’ exertion. Conclusions: WT-SLS depicted the greatest muscle activation, suggesting possible better clinical and functional outcomes considering GM activation and strengthening. UGM was preferentially activated during WT-SLS, but not during SU and UWS. Therefore, targeting GM with our novel exercise may improve gluteal weakness and dysfunction in lumbar radiculopathy, knee ligament injuries; as preventive measure for injury; or for postural correction. © 2023 Professor P K Surendran Memorial Education Foundation",Gluteus maximus; Muscle activation; Surface electromyography,adult; Article; cross-sectional study; exercise; female; force; gluteus maximus muscle; human; male; maximum voluntary isometric contraction; modified Borg dyspnea scale; motor unit potential; muscle cell; muscle function; muscle isometric contraction; normal human; perception; statistical significance; step up; surface electromyography; unilateral wall squat; wall touch single limb stance exercise; young adult,"""Application of Machine Learning and Biomechanics in Musculoskeletal Health and Wearable Devices""","Knee Assessment and Recovery: Validity, Reliability, and Clinical Trials",Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

A detailed finite element model of the knee joint is coupled to a lower extremity musculoskeletal model to simulate the stance phase of stair ascent. It is driven by the mean of measurements on the hip-knee-ankle moments-angles as well as ground reaction forces reported in healthy individuals. Predicted muscle activities compare well to the recorded electromyography data. Peak forces in quadriceps (3.87 BW, body weight, at 20% instance in our 607 N subject), medial hamstrings (0.77 BW at 20%), and gastrocnemii (1.21 BW at 80%) are estimated. Due to much greater flexion angles-moments in the first half of stance, large PF contact forces (peak of 3.1 BW at 20% stance) and stresses (peak of 4.83 MPa at 20% stance) are estimated that exceed their peaks in level walking by fourfold and twofold, respectively. Compared with level walking, ACL forces diminish in the first half of stance but substantially increase later in the second half (peak of 0.76 BW at 75% stance). Under nearly similar contact forces at 20% of stance, the contact stress on the tibiofemoral (TF) medial plateau reaches a peak (9.68 MPa) twice that on the PF joint suggesting the vulnerability of both joints. Compared with walking, stair ascent increases peak ACL force and both peak TF and PF contact stresses. Reductions in the knee flexion moment and/or angle appear as a viable strategy to mitigate internal loads and pain. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",anterior cruciate ligament; contact forces; finite element; knee joint; muscle forces; patellofemoral joint; stair ascent,"Biomechanical Phenomena; Gait; Humans; Knee Joint; Ligaments; Muscle, Skeletal; Walking; Biophysics; Finite element method; Joints (anatomy); Muscle; Physiological models; Anterior cruciate ligament; Contact forces; Contact Stress; Finite element; Knee joint; Level walking; Muscle force; Patellofemoral contacts; Patellofemoral joint; Stair ascent; biomechanics; gait; human; knee; ligament; physiology; skeletal muscle; walking; Stairs",Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

The aim of this study was to characterize the acute and adaptive cardiovascular and metabolic effects of two low or no impact therapies in patients with severe lower-limb osteoarthritis: passive heat therapy (Heat) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) utilizing primarily the unaffected limbs, compared to a control intervention of home-based exercise (Home). Participants completed up to 12 weeks of either Heat (20–30 min immersed in 40°C water followed by ~15-min light resistance exercise), HIIT (6–8 × 60-s intervals on a cross-trainer or arm ergometer at ~90–100% peak (Figure presented.) O2) or Home (~15-min light resistance exercise); all 3 sessions/week. Reductions in systolic (12 & 10 mm Hg), diastolic (7 & 4 mm Hg), and mean arterial (8 & 6 mm Hg) blood pressure (BP) were observed following one bout of Heat or HIIT exposure, lasting for the duration of the 20-min monitoring period. Across the interventions (i.e., 12 weeks), resting systolic BP and diastolic BP decreased with Heat (−9 & -4 mm Hg; p < 0.001) and HIIT (−7 & -3 mm Hg; p ≤ 0.011), but not Home (0 & 0 mm Hg; p ≥ 0.785). The systolic and diastolic BP responses to an acute exposure of Heat or HIIT in the first intervention session were moderately correlated with adaptive responses across the intervention (r ≥ 0.54, p ≤ 0.005). Neither intervention improved indices of glycemic control (p = 0.310). In summary, both Heat and HIIT induced potent immediate and adaptive hypotensive effects, and the acute response was moderately predictive of the long-term response. © 2023 The Authors.

These symptoms often reduce physical activity levels and increase the risk of functional decline. Though we have previously proposed cluster-set resistance training to mitigate symptom burden in lung cancer, there is currently no data on the feasibility or acceptability of this mode of exercise in cancer. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of a hybrid-delivery home-based cluster-set resistance training program in individuals with NSCLC stages I–III (i.e., early stage). Methods: This study aimed to recruit individuals with NSCLC stages I–III post-treatment to participate in 8 weeks of home-based resistance training, 3 days per week. The program included supervised sessions in the participants’ homes and virtual supervision via videoconferencing. The primary outcome measure of feasibility was evaluated through recruitment, retention, and intervention fidelity (i.e., proportion of exercise completed, relative to what was prescribed). Intervention acceptability (i.e., ease and quality of virtual delivery, level of difficulty, and home-based approach) was assessed using a 4-point Likert-type scale from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”. Results: Fourteen participants were recruited over a 6-month period, with 11 completing the intervention (2 withdrew due to unrelated illness, 1 withdrew due to requiring active treatment), yielding a retention rate of 79%. Characteristics of the participants who completed the intervention (n = 11) were as follows: mean age: 71 ± 10 years, mean BMI: 29.1 ± 6.5, and average time since diagnosis was 62 ± 51 months. Of completers, 27% were male, and 36% were Black; 10 were stage I (91%), and one was stage II (9%). Mean session attendance was 86.4 ± 9.5%. Mean intervention fidelity was 83.1 ± 13.1%. With regard to acceptability, > 90% of participants positively rated all aspects of the intervention delivery. No adverse events related to exercise were recorded. Conclusions: The hybrid delivery of a home-based resistance exercise program for individuals previously treated for early-stage NSCLC was found to be safe and feasible. Adaptations to the program for future interventions are required, particularly surrounding resistance exercise programming, and intervention delivery with home visits.

The development of biological augmentation methods that mitigate scar formation and regenerate the enthesis is still an unmet need. Since neonatal enthesis is capable of regeneration after injury, this study tested whether delivery of neonatal tendon progenitor cells (TPCs) into the adult injured environment can enhance functional and structural supraspinatus enthesis and tendon healing. Methods: TPCs were isolated from Ai14 Rosa26-TdTomato mouse Achilles tendons and labeled using adenovirus-Cre. Fifty-two CB57BL/6J mice underwent detachment and acute repair of the supraspinatus tendon and received either a fibrin-only or TPC-fibrin gel. Immunofluorescence analysis was carried out to determine cellularity (DAPI), fibrocartilage (SOX9), macrophages (F4/80), myofibroblasts (α-smooth muscle actin), and scar (laminin). Assays for function (gait and biomechanical testing) and structure (micro–computed tomography imaging, picrosirius red/Alcian Blue staining, type I and III collagen staining) were carried out. Results: Analysis of TdTomato cells after injury showed minimal retention of TPCs by day 7 and day 14, with detected cells localized near the bursa and deltoid rather than the enthesis/tendon. However, TPC delivery led to significantly increased %Sox9+ cells in the enthesis at day 7 after injury and decreased laminin intensity across almost all time points compared to fibrin-only treatment. Similarly, TPC-treated mice showed gait recovery by day 14 (paw area and stride length) and day 28 (stance time), while fibrin-treated mice failed to recover gait parameters. Despite improved gait, biomechanical testing showed no differences between groups. Structural analysis by micro–computed tomography suggests that TPC application improves cortical thickness after surgery compared to fibrin. Superior collagen alignment at the neo-enthesis was also observed in the TPC-augmented group at day 28, but no difference was detected in type I and III collagen intensity. Conclusion: We found that neonatal TPCs improved and restored functional gait by reducing overall scar formation, improving enthesis collagen alignment, and altering bony composition response after supraspinatus tendon repair. TPCs did not appear to integrate into the healing tissue, suggesting improved healing may be due to paracrine effects at early stages. Future work will determine the factors secreted by TPCs to develop translational targets. © 2022 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees",Basic Science Study; biological augmentation; enthesis; functional healing; In Vivo Animal Model; rotator cuff repair; Rotator cuff tear; scar formation; shoulder surgery; tendon progenitor cells,Actins; Alcian Blue; Animals; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cicatrix; Collagen; Fibrin; Gait; Laminin; Mice; Rotator Cuff; Rotator Cuff Injuries; Stem Cells; Tendons; X-Ray Microtomography; alcian blue; alpha smooth muscle actin; collagen type 1; collagen type 3; fibrin; laminin; transcription factor Sox9; actin; collagen; fibrin; laminin; achilles tendon; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; biomechanics; cell isolation; controlled study; cortical thickness (bone); fibrocartilage; gait; human; immunofluorescence; macrophage; male; micro-computed tomography; mouse; myofibroblast; newborn; nonhuman; rotator cuff repair; scar formation; stem cell; tenocyte; animal; gait; pathology; rotator cuff; rotator cuff injury; scar; stem cell; surgery; tendon,"""Shoulder Joint Health and Rehabilitation: Arthroscopic Surgeries, Treatments and Outcomes""",Clinical Outcomes and Treatments in Shoulder Care,Advances in Tissue Regeneration and Healing in Musculoskeletal Disorders

The psychosocial approach is one of the important approaches in managing musculoskeletal pain in patients. Therefore, this study aimed to determine and compare the effects of psychosocial skills training on pain intensity in patients with acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain. Methods: In this quasi-experimental study, 64 patients with acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain were selected using convenience sampling. Both groups received psychosocial training in pain management in groups of 8–10 people over six 1-h sessions. The data were collected at baseline, after the intervention, and 3 months later using a numerical rating scale (NRS). Then, the data were entered into the SPSS 22 software and were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: In this study, the mean age of the participants was 50.10 ± 10.63 years and 60.9% of them were female. Based on the results, time had a significant effect on pain intensity (p < 0.001), but the effect of group on pain intensity was not statistically significant (p = 0.07). The group × time effect on pain intensity was also statistically significant (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Psychosocial training had a positive impact on the reduction of pain among the patients with acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain. Additionally, the training was more effective in patients with acute pain due to early training. These findings can help healthcare providers in the field of musculoskeletal pain management, especially in patients with acute pain. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",acute pain; chronic pain; education; musculoskeletal pain; psychosocial intervention,Acute Pain; Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Musculoskeletal Pain; Research Design; Social Group; adult; female; human; male; methodology; middle aged; musculoskeletal pain; pain,"""Pain Management and Musculoskeletal Health in Various Populations""",Chronic Pain Management and Treatment Studies,Management and Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

Whether TrPs are primary or secondary phenomena or if they relate to central or peripheral nervous system disorders is controversial. Referred pain, a cardinal sign of TrPs, is a central phenomenon driven by peripheral input. In 2021, the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) proposed a clinical criteria and grading system for classifying patients with pain on nociceptive, neuropathic, or nociplastic phenotypes. Myofascial TrP pain has been traditionally categorized as a nociceptive phenotype; however, increasing evidence supports that this condition could be present in patients with predominantly nociplastic pain, particularly when it is associated with an underlying medical condition. The clinical response of some therapeutic approaches for managing TrPs remains unclear. Accordingly, the ability to classify myofascial TrP pain into one of these phenotypes would likely be critical for producing more successful clinical treatment outcomes by a precision medicine approach. This consensus paper presents evidence supporting the possibility of subgrouping individuals with myofascial TrP pain into nociceptive, nociplastic, or mixed-type phenotype. It is concluded that myofascial pain caused by TrPs is primarily a nociceptive pain condition, is unlikely to be classified as neuropathic or nociplastic, but can be present in patients with predominantly neuropathic or nociplastic pain. In the latter cases, management of the predominant central pain problem should be a major treatment goal, but the peripheral drive from TrPs should not be ignored, since TrP treatment has been shown to reduce sensitization-associated symptomatology in nociplastic pain conditions, e.g., fibromyalgia. © 2023 by the authors.",central sensitization; musculoskeletal pain; myofascial pain; nociceptive pain; nociplastic pain; peripheral sensitization; precision medicine; trigger points,,"""Pain Management and Musculoskeletal Health in Various Populations""",Chronic Pain Management and Treatment Studies,Management and Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

Physical activity has been shown to improve depressive symptoms in this population, but the relationship of sedentary behavior with depression has not been studied. In this study, we examined the relationship between sedentary behavior and depression in patients with chronic kidney disease. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 5,205 participants aged ≥ 18 years with chronic kidney disease participating in the 2007–2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Recreation activity, work activity, walking or cycling for transportation, and sedentary behavior were measured using the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire. A series of weighted logistic regression models were used to investigate the aforementioned relationship. Results: The prevalence of depression among US adults with chronic kidney disease was 10.97% in our study. In addition, sedentary behavior was strongly associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms, as measured by the PHQ-9 (P < 0.001). In the fully adjusted model, we found that compared with participants who had shorter durations of sedentary behavior, participants who had the highest durations of sedentary behavior had 1.69 times (odd ratio 1.69, 95% confidence interval: 1.27, 2.24) greater risk of being clinically depressed. After adjusting for confounding factors, subgroup analyses showed that the association between sedentary behavior and depression still existed in all stratifications. Conclusion: We found an association between longer duration of sedentary behavior and more severe depression in US adults with chronic kidney disease; however, prospective studies with larger sample sizes are still needed to confirm the effects of sedentary behavior on depression in the chronic kidney disease population. © 2023, The Author(s).","Depression; Physical activity, Chronic kidney disease; Sedentary behavior","Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Humans; Nutrition Surveys; Prospective Studies; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Sedentary Behavior; hemoglobin A1c; adult; age distribution; alcohol consumption; Article; chronic kidney failure; cross-sectional study; depression; diabetes mellitus; disease association; disease duration; female; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; marriage; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; physical activity; prevalence; recreation; sedentary lifestyle; sex difference; smoking habit; traffic and transport; United States; walking; work engagement; chronic kidney failure; complication; depression; nutrition; prospective study","""Physical Activity and Health Outcomes in Aging Populations""",Physical Activity and Health in Older Adults,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Methods: A retrospective review of consecutive patients with glenohumeral osteoarthritis who underwent arthroscopic supraspinatus repairs between 2013 and 2018 with a minimum of 1-year follow up was performed. Demographic variables included age, tobacco use, alcohol use, diabetes, sex, hypercholesterolemia, and body mass index while injury patterns included partial- versus full-thickness tear, bicep tendon involvement, and osteoarthritis severity. Multivariate linear regression was used to identify independent predictors of visual analog pain scale (VAS), subjective shoulder value (SSV), and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score as well as active range of motion (ROM) in forward flexion (FF) and external rotation (ER). Binary logistic regression was used to identify predictors of repair failure as well as postoperative strength in FF and ER. Results: In total, 91 patients (mean age 61.48 ± 9.4 years) were identified with an average follow up of 26.3 ± 5.7 months. Repair failures occurred in 9.9% (9/91 patients) of the total cohort. Postoperative outcomes were significantly improved with regards to visual analog pain scale, subjective shoulder value, ASES score, ROM in FF, FF strength, and external rotation strength compared with preoperative baseline. Obesity (P = .023) and diabetes (P = .010) were significant independent predictors of greater pain scores postoperatively. Obesity (P = .029) and tobacco use (P = .007) were significant predictors of lower ASES scores postoperatively. Finally, moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis was a significant risk factor for poor ROM and strength in FF postoperatively compared to mild osteoarthritis (P = .029). No variables were predictive of repair failure. Conclusions: Tobacco use, obesity, and diabetes are associated with worse pain and patient-reported outcomes following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair in the context of glenohumeral OA. In addition, moderate-to-severe OA is associated with worse strength and forward flexion compared to those with mild OA.

Methods Teachers tested 217 children aged between 5 and 11 years old, after a one hour training session, using a freely available tool (FUNMOVES). Four classes (n = 91) were scored by both researchers and teachers to evaluate inter-rater reliability. Researchers assessed 22 children using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (MABC-2; considered to be the ‘gold standard’ in Europe for use as part of the diagnostic process for Developmental Coordination Disorder) to assess concurrent and predictive validity. Results Inter-rater reliability for all individual activities within FUNMOVES ranged from 0.85–0.97 (unweighted Kappa; with 95%CI ranging from 0.77–1). For total score this was lower (κ = 0.76, 95%CI = 0.68–0.84), however when incorporating linear weighting, this improved (κ = 0.94, 95%CI = 0.89–0.99). When evaluating FUNMOVES total score against the MABC-2 total score, the specificity (1, 95%CI = 0.63–1) and positive predictive value (1; 95%CI = 0.68–1) of FUNMOVES were high, whereas sensitivity (0.57, 95%CI = 0.29–0.82) and negative predictive values (0.57, 95%CI = 0.42–0.71) were moderate. Evaluating only MABC-2 subscales which are directly related to fundamental movement skills (Aiming & Catching, and Balance) improved these values to 0.89 (95%CI = 0.52–1) and 0.93 (95%CI = 0.67– 0.99) respectively. Interpretation Teacher-led screening of fundamental movement skills (via FUNMOVES) is an effective method of identifying children with motor difficulties. Such universal screening in schools has the potential to identify movement difficulties and enable earlier intervention than the current norm. © 2024 Eddy et al.

Design: We conducted a 3-round modified Delphi survey involving an international group of researchers, health professionals, health administrators and people with OA. In Round 1, participants ranked the importance of 75 outcome and descriptive domains in five categories: patient impacts, implementation outcomes, and characteristics of the OAMP and its participants and clinicians. Domains ranked as “important” or “essential” by ≥80% of participants were retained, and participants could suggest additional domains. In Round 2, participants rated their level of agreement that each domain was essential for evaluating OAMPs: 0 = strongly disagree to 10 = strongly agree. A domain was retained if ≥80% rated it ≥6. In Round 3, participants rated remaining domains using same scale as in Round 2; a domain was recommended as “core” if ≥80% of participants rated it ≥9 and as “optional” if ≥80% rated it ≥7. Results: A total of 178 individuals from 26 countries participated; 85 completed all survey rounds. Only one domain, “ability to participate in daily activities”, met criteria for a core domain; 25 domains met criteria for an optional recommendation: 8 Patient Impacts, 5 Implementation Outcomes, 5 Participant Characteristics, 3 OAMP Characteristics and 4 Clinician Characteristics. Conclusion: The ability of patients with OA to participate in daily activities should be evaluated in all OAMPs.

Methods: Five hundred seventy-two patients were assessed on their daily ambulatory activity for 1 wk with a step activity monitor, and were evaluated on whether or not they achieved 150 min/wk of moderate-intensity PA. Results: Thirty-one percent (n = 175) of the patients with PAD met the PA time-intensity guidelines and 69% (n = 397) did not. In a final multivariable logistic regression model identifying the independent predictors of meeting the PA time-intensity guidelines from clinical characteristics, diabetes was the only significant variable entered (OR = 0.310: 95% CI, 0.175-0.538; P <.001) and was associated with a 69% lower chance of meeting the guidelines. Patients with diabetes spent less daily time in moderate-intensity ambulatory PA than patients without diabetes (15 ± 13 vs 23 ± 20 min/d; P <.001). Conclusions: Thirty-one percent of patients with PAD and claudication met the PA time-intensity guidelines. Furthermore, patients with diabetes were least likely to meet the PA time-intensity guidelines, as they had a 69% lower chance than patients without diabetes. The clinical significance is that PAD patients who have diabetes are particularly susceptible to being physically sedentary, and are therefore prime patients who should be encouraged to increase their daily PA.

It is important to find an optimal spatial margin between the body and an obstacle considering both safety and efficiency. One side of finding the optimal margin is to decrease the margin in terms of motor efficiency. In this study, we tested whether fingertip-contact intervention to obtain haptic feedback information to perceive the relationship between body and the environment could immediately improve spatial perception and collision avoidance behavior (an instantaneous effect). Methods: Twenty-seven older adults (12 males and 15 females) participated in the experiment. In the intervention of the fingertip-contact group, they lightly touched the edge of a door with both fingertips while walking. The test task before and after the intervention involved grasping a horizontal bar and passing through a narrow opening. As dependent variables, we measured the spatial margin and the collision rate. Results: The fingertip-contact group showed a significant decrease in the spatial margin after the intervention. On the other hand, there was no significant improvement in the collision rate after the intervention but rather a decrease only in the control group. Conclusion: The results obtained in this study indicate that touching obstacles with the fingertips had an instantaneous effect, leading to efficient movement learning, although a possible side effect of an increased collision rated was also found. The proposed intervention might promote an efficiency-based strategy due to learning the spatial relationship between the body and the environment, and it may suppress the excessive avoidance of older adults. © 2022, The Author(s).",Aperture passing; Error learning; Fingertip contact; Haptic feedback; Obstacle avoidance,Aged; Feedback; Female; Haptic Technology; Humans; Male; Movement; Touch; Walking; aged; feedback system; female; human; male; movement (physiology); touch; walking,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Impact of Visual and Virtual Reality Interventions in Sports and Rehabilitation

Although promising results, the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on postural control in people with PD is unclear, especially in objective measures such as the center of pressure (CoP) parameters. Thus, we analyzed the effects of a single session of tDCS on the CoP parameters during the adapted tandem position in people with PD. Methods: Nineteen people with PD participated in this crossover, randomized, and double-blind study. Anodal tDCS was applied over the primary motor cortex in two conditions of stimulation (2 mA/active and sham) on two different days for 20 min immediately before the postural control evaluation. Participants remained standing in an adapted tandem position for the postural control assessment for 30 s (three trials). CoP parameters were acquired by a force plate. Results: No significant differences were demonstrated between stimulation conditions (p-value range = 0.15–0.89). Conclusions: Our results suggested that a single session of tDCS with 2 mA does not improve the postural control of people with PD during adapted tandem. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Balance; Brain stimulation; Electrical stimulation; Kinetic; Movement disorders; Neurodegenerative disease,Double-Blind Method; Humans; Parkinson Disease; Pilot Projects; Postural Balance; Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation; levodopa; aged; Article; body equilibrium; body position; burning sensation; clinical article; controlled study; crossover procedure; disease duration; double blind procedure; female; Hoehn and Yahr scale; human; male; MDS-Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale; Mini Mental State Examination; motor dysfunction; Parkinson disease; pilot study; postural instability; primary motor cortex; randomized controlled trial; skin irritation; skin pruritus; skin redness; skin tingling; somnolence; standing; transcranial direct current stimulation; treatment failure; body equilibrium; Parkinson disease; physiology; procedures,"""Effects of Various Interventions on Postural Stability and Balance Control""",Postural Stability and Lower Limb Motor Control Studies,Evaluation and Improvement of Postural Balance and Muscle Strength

We thus investigated the impact of activity monitor placement on the accuracy of detecting SB and PA in older adults, as well as a novel random forest algorithm trained on data from older persons. Four monitor types (ActiGraph wGT3X-BT, ActivPAL3c VT, GENEActiv Original, and DynaPort MM+) were simultaneously worn on five anatomical sites during ten different activities by a sample of twenty older adults (70.0 (12.0) years; 10 women). The results indicated that collecting metabolic equivalent (MET) data for 60 s provided the most representative results, minimising variability. In addition, thigh-worn monitors, including ActivPAL, Random Forest, and Sedentary Sphere—Thigh, exhibited superior performance in classifying SB, with balanced accuracies ≥ 94.2%. Other monitors, such as ActiGraph, DynaPort MM+, and GENEActiv Sedentary Sphere—Wrist, demonstrated lower performance. ActivPAL and GENEActiv Random Forest outperformed other monitors in participant-specific balanced accuracies for SB classification. Only thigh-worn monitors achieved acceptable overall balanced accuracies (≥80.0%) for SB, standing, and medium-to-vigorous PA classifications. In conclusion, it is advisable to position accelerometers on the thigh, collect MET data for ≥60 s, and ideally utilise population-specific trained algorithms. © 2024 by the authors.",accelerometry; ageing; physical behaviour,Accelerometers; Forestry; Accelerometry; Actigraph; Activity monitors; Metabolic equivalents; Older adults; Performance; Physical activity; Physical behaviors; Random forest algorithm; Random forests; Population statistics,"""Physical Activity and Health Outcomes in Aging Populations""",Physical Activity and Health in Older Adults,Wearable Devices and Techniques in Gait Analysis and Mobility Rehabilitation

There is accumulating evidence that exercise can reduce inflammation. However, the optimal intensity of exercise to reduce systemic inflammation is unknown. Aims: The aim of this randomised crossover study was to identify the difference between high- and low-intensity aerobic exercise on the inflammatory profile of cancer survivors after a single exercise session (acute) and a short training period (six sessions over 2 weeks). Method: Participants (n = 20) were randomised to either low- or high-intensity exercise. They underwent 2 weeks of stationary cycling at their assigned intensity and then underwent a 6-week washout period of no exercise before returning to complete 2 weeks of exercise at the remaining intensity. Results: Twenty participants with a mean age of 56.4 (±9.4) years were enrolled and completed the intervention. There was no effect of exercise intensity after a single exercise session. After 2 weeks of training, there was a significant effect of intensity on chemokines CCL2 (mean difference ± SEM; 13.2 pg/mL ± 5.0, p =.04) and CXCL12 (150.3 pg/mL ± 51.8, p =.02), where CCL2 was decreased after low-intensity exercise and CXCL12 decreased after high-intensity exercise. Discussion: Our data suggest that while exercise intensity may impact different cell types in the circulation, both low- and high-intensity exercise can positively modulate inflammatory markers. Conclusion: The potential to scale up low-intensity exercise over time is likely to be more broadly applicable and achievable for cancer survivor cohorts while still eliciting beneficial effects on systemic inflammation. © 2023 The Authors.

So far, in vivo hip and knee joint loads during swimming remain undescribed.Methods:In vivo hip and knee joint loads were measured in 6 patients who underwent THA and 5 patients who underwent TKA with instrumented joint implants. Joint loads, including the resultant joint contact force (FRes), torsional moment around the femoral shaft axis or the tibial axis (MTors), bending moment at the middle of the femoral neck (MBend), torsional moment around the femoral neck axis (MTne), and medial force ratio (MFR) in the knee, were measured during breaststroke swimming at 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7 m/s and the breaststroke and crawl kicks at 0.5 and 1.0 m/s.Results:The ranges of the median maximal FReswere 157% to 193% of body weight for the hip and 93% to 145% of body weight for the knee during breaststroke swimming. Greater maxima of FRes(hip and knee), MTors(hip and knee), MBend(hip), and MTne(hip) were observed with higher breaststroke swimming velocities, but significance was only identified between 0.5 and 0.6 m/s in FRes(p = 0.028), MTors(p = 0.028), and MBend(p = 0.028) and between 0.5 and 0.7 m/s in FRes(p = 0.045) in hips. No difference was found in maximal MFR between different breaststroke swimming velocities. The maximal FReswas significantly positively correlated with the breaststroke swimming velocity (hip: r = 0.541; p < 0.05; and knee: r = 0.414; p < 0.001). The maximal FRes(hip and knee) and moments (hip) were higher in the crawl kick than in the breaststroke kick, and a significant difference was recognized in FRes Maxfor the hip: median, 179% versus 118% of body weight (p = 0.028) for 0.5 m/s and 166% versus 133% of body weight (p = 0.028) for 1.0 m/s.Conclusions:Swimming is a safe and low-impact activity, particularly recommended for patients who undergo THA or TKA. Hip and knee joint loads are greater with higher swimming velocities and can be influenced by swimming styles. Nevertheless, concrete suggestions to patients who undergo arthroplasty on swimming should involve individual considerations.Level of Evidence:Therapeutic Level IV.

Data sources: Peer-reviewed articles (inception to 4 August 2022) from PubMed, CINAHL, PsycInfo, EMBASE, Scopus, SportDiscus and the Cochrane library. Review methods: All types of methodological approaches were considered. Inclusion criteria were community-dwelling; diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment; aged 50+ years. Interventions needed to include falls prevention programs aiming to reduce falls and/or risk of falls. Outcomes of interest included number and/or rate of falls, falls prevalence and falls risk factors. For controlled trials, any control group was included. Quality assessment was completed using Cochrane's Risk of Bias Tool for randomized controlled trials and the Standard Quality Assessment Criteria for Evaluating Primary Research Papers from a Variety of Fields for all other studies. Where statistical data pooling was not possible, narrative synthesis was used to present data in tables and figures. Results: Forty-seven studies were included. Prevalence of falls was 43% when data were gathered prospectively for 12 months. Confirmed falls risk factors included slow gait, dual-tasking, postural control and non-amnesic Mild Cognitive Impairment. Few studies evaluated interventions to reduce falls. Six meta-analyses were conducted, no significant reduction in falls was found. Conclusions: Until further high-quality, adequately powered studies are available to guide practice, best practice guidelines recommend balance training as a core component of falls prevention programs for older people generally, as well as people with Mild Cognitive Impairment. © The Author(s) 2022.",accidental fall; community-dwelling; Mild Cognitive Disorder,Adult; Aged; Cognitive Dysfunction; Exercise; Humans; Prevalence; Risk Factors; adult; aged; cognitive defect; exercise; human; meta analysis; prevalence; risk factor,"""Balance, Mobility, and Fall Risks in Aging and Musculoskeletal Conditions""",Impact and Control of Chronic Low Back Pain and Balance in Older Adults,Fall Prevention and Balance Improvement in the Elderly

The main purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of BFR-LLST added to usual care exercise early after cartilage or meniscus repair in the knee joint. Methods: We included 42 patients with cartilage (n = 21) or meniscus repair (n = 21) of the knee joint. They attended 9 weeks of BFR-LLST added to a usual care exercise program at an outpatient rehabilitation center. Outcome measures were assessed at different time points from four (baseline) to 26 weeks postoperatively and included adherence, harms, knee joint and thigh pain, perceived exertion, thigh circumference (muscle size proxy), isometric knee-extension strength, self-reported disability and quality of life. Results: On average, patients with cartilage or meniscus repair completed > 84% of the total BFR-LLST supervised sessions. Thirty-eight patients reported 146 adverse events of which none were considered serious. No decrease in thigh circumference or exacerbation of knee joint or quadriceps muscle pain of the operated leg was found in either group during the intervention period. Conclusions: BFR-LLST added to usual care exercise initiated early after cartilage or meniscus repair seems feasible and may prevent disuse thigh muscle atrophy during a period of weight bearing restrictions. Harms were reported, but no serious adverse events were found. Our findings are promising but need replication using a RCT-design.

This study aimed to determine the test-retest reliability of the WBB for measuring SSB in this population. A secondary aim was to determine the minimum detectable change (MDC) and standard error of measurement (SEM) of the WBB in children aged 6-9 years. METHODS: 52 children between 6-9 years of age participated. 'One leg stand balance' was used to assess center of pressure velocity (COPV) and center of pressure area (COPA) on three occasions by the same tester. Two tests were conducted on the same day (Day 1) and the third test was performed on another day (Day 2), with a period of 5-13 days between the two test days. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC 3,1), SEMs, and MDC were calculated. RESULTS: Intra-day test-retest reliability of COPA was found to be good (ICC3,1 =0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75, 0.92) and that of COPV was also found to be good (ICC3,1 =0.87; 95% CI: 0.77, 0.92). Inter-day test-retest reliability was found to be good for COPA (ICC3,1 = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.75, 0.93) and COPV (ICC3,1 = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.94). SEM for COPA in intra-day testing was 18.90 mm2 (15.78%), and in inter-day testing it was 16.44 mm2 (13.61%). SEM for COPV in intra-day testing was 1.12 mm/s (7.6%), and in inter-day testing it was 1.01 mm/s (6.9%). MDC for COPA in intra-day testing was 52.41mm2 (42.75%), and in inter-day testing was 45.58 mm2 (35.75%). MDC for COPV in intra-day testing was 3.11 mm/s (21.2%), and in inter-day testing it was 2.80 mm/s (18.9%). CONCLUSION: The WBB has good test-retest reliability for assessing SSB of children between 6-9 years. COPA measurements appear to be less sensitive to clinical changes in SSB when compared to COPV. Assessment of validity of the WBB in this age group is recommended before it can be considered as a potential balance assessment tool in children.  © 2023-IOS Press.

Demographic characteristics, physical health levels, and individual lifestyles/healthy behaviors are associated with the severity of depression. However, the major risk factor for depression remains unclear. Materials and methods: In this investigation, 16,512 patients were screened using the CHARLS (China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study) database after being determined to be eligible based on the inclusion criteria. Depressive symptoms were evaluated through the CESD-10 (10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale). Consequently, various models were developed based on potential predictive factors, employing stepwise LR (Logistic Regression)/RF (Random Forests) models to examine the influence and weighting of candidate factors that affect depression. Results: Gender, residential address location, changes in health status following last interview, physical disabilities, chronic pain, childhood health status, ADL (activity of daily living), and social activity were all revealed to be independent risk factors for depression (p < 0.05) in this study. Depression has a synergic effect (across chronic pain and age groups). In comparison to other factors, RF results showed that chronic pain had a stronger impact on depression. Conclusion: This preliminary study reveals that chronic pain is a major risk factor for depression.

Exercise has improved body composition among cancer survivors, yet no randomized controlled trial has explored the effect of exercise on body composition in women with ovarian cancer. In this analysis, we examined the effect of a six-month aerobic exercise intervention on body composition among ovarian cancer survivors in the Women’s Activity and Lifestyle Study in Connecticut (WALC). Methods: Women with ovarian cancer (N = 144) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 6 months of an aerobic exercise intervention or attention-control, and body composition was measured as a secondary outcome at baseline and 6 months via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Women with at least one DEXA scan were included in the analysis (N = 103). Results: On average, participants were 57.1 (± 8.7) years old and 1.6 (± 0.9) years since diagnosis. Women randomized to exercise maintained weight during the trial (− 0.11 kg, P = 0.82), while women in attention-control gained weight (+ 1.40 kg, P = 0.03); however, the between-group difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.09). We found no statistically significant differences by study arm for changes in body fat percentage, bone mineral density, or lean body mass. Conclusions: Weight was maintained as a result of a 6-month aerobic exercise intervention among post-treatment ovarian cancer survivors. Future exercise and healthy eating interventions should consider additional measures (e.g., computer tomography scans, D3-creatinine) to more accurately assess changes in body composition. Implications for Cancer Survivors: Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise may help ovarian cancer survivors maintain weight. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Body composition; Body weight; Exercise; Ovarian cancer,Body Composition; Cancer Survivors; Exercise; Female; Humans; Obesity; Ovarian Neoplasms; body composition; cancer survivor; controlled study; exercise; female; human; obesity; ovary tumor; randomized controlled trial,"""Physical Activity, Rehabilitation, and Health Outcomes in Medical Conditions""",Impact of Exercise and Rehabilitation on Quality of Life and Health in Patients,Exercise Programs and Physical Activity in Cancer Recovery

Clinical presentation of AT might differ from place to place, depending on different variables including cultural factors. This study was conducted to determine the clinical picture of AT in a group of clients referring to an outpatient orthopedics clinic in Shiraz, southern Iran. In this cross-sectional study, a convenient sample of 61 (46 female and 15 male) patients attending to a referral outpatient clinic affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences with a definite diagnosis of AT was studied. Patients with partial- or full-thickness tear of Achilles tendon, history of radicular pain or lower extremity injury, previous history of surgery on their lower extremity, and pregnant women were excluded from the study. We used Maffulli et al. (Foot Ankle Surg 26:240–9, 2020) criteria for the diagnosis of AT in our patients. The patients had a mean age of 47.7 (SD 11.1) years and mean BMI of 28.7 (4.2) kg/m2. There was no significant correlation between the age and body mass index of the participants (Pearson’s r = –0.028, p = 0.832). The prevalence of insertional AT among 58 patients with only one site affected, was 84% (95% CI 72–92%), significantly (p < 0.001) higher than that of midportional AT (16%). Women were more frequently affected than men (p < 0.001). The clinical presentation of AT in southern Iran is somewhat different from those reported in other parts of the world. Further studies on larger groups of patients should be done to determine the causes of the observed differences. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Achilles tendon; Lower extremity; Sedentary behavior; Tendinopathy; Tendons,,"""Achilles Tendinopathy and Musculoskeletal Ultrasound Studies in Sport Medicine""",Achilles Tendon Health & Rehabilitation Research,Tendon Rehabilitation and Treatment Methods

The challenge remains how to deliver cost effective PA interventions that have impact on individual behaviour. Digital technologies can support and promote PA remotely at scale. We describe the development of a behaviourally informed smartphone application (Stay-Active) for women attending an NHS GDM clinic. Stay-Active will support an existing motivational interviewing intervention to increase and maintain PA in this population. Methods: The behaviour change wheel (BCW) eight step theoretical approach was used to design the application. It provided a systematic approach to understanding the target behaviour, identifying relevant intervention functions, and specifying intervention content. The target behaviour was to increase and maintain PA. To obtain a behavioural diagnosis, qualitative evidence was combined with focus groups on the barriers and facilitators to PA in women with GDM. The findings were mapped onto the Capability Opportunity Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) model and Theoretical Domains Framework to identify what needs to change for the target behaviour and linked to appropriate intervention functions. Finally, behaviour changes techniques (BCT) and modes of delivery that are most likely to serve the intervention functions were selected. Current evidence, patient focus groups and input from key stakeholders informed Stay-Active’s development. Results: We found that psychological capability, reflective and automatic motivation, social and physical opportunity needed to change to increase PA in women with GDM. The four key intervention functions identified were Enablement, Education, Persuasion and Training. Stay-Active incorporates these four intervention functions delivering ten BCTs including: goal setting, credible source, self-monitoring, action planning, prompts and cues. The final design of Stay-Active delivers these BCTs via an educational resource centre, with goal setting and action planning features, personalised performance feedback and individualised promotional messages. Conclusion: The BCW has enabled the systematic and comprehensive development of Stay-Active to promote PA in women with GDM within an NHS Maternity service. The next phase is to conduct a trial to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a multi-component intervention that combines Stay-Active with PA Motivational Interviewing. © 2022, The Author(s).",,"Behavior Therapy; Diabetes, Gestational; Exercise; Female; Humans; Motivation; Pregnancy; Smartphone; Article; automation; behavior change; biological model; conceptual framework; diabetic patient; diagnostic test; evidence based medicine; feasibility study; female; health care planning; health education; health promotion; human; maternal behavior; maternal care; mobile application; motivation; motivational interviewing; national health service; personalized medicine; physical activity; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; pregnant woman; psychological aspect; qualitative research; self monitoring; social aspect; stakeholder engagement; behavior therapy; exercise; pregnancy; procedures; psychology; smartphone","""Effects of Exercise and Lifestyle Modification on Diabetes, Obesity, and Cardiovascular Health""",Effects of Exercise Programs on Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Health Outcomes,Physical Activity and Health Risks

It employed a quasi-experimental design with 40 male undergraduate students as a sample divided into 4 groups. The instruments used the Multistage Fitness Test (MFT), sit and reach test, sit-ups, push-ups, leg and back dynamometer, and Omron karada scan body composition. The data analysis technique used the normality test, homogeneity test, and box test followed by hypothesis testing using multivariate analysis (MANOVA) with 22 factorial analysis. The results of the Multivariate Test calculations showed all groups had significant improvements of p<0.05, except for fat percentage (p=0,806). So that it can be said that weight training carried out according to the right exercise dose with the selection of appropriate exercise methods and by paying attention to rest between sets will be able to have a positive impact on cardiorespiratory endurance (VO2 max), flexibility, muscle strength (legs, back), muscular endurance (upper body, abdomen), and no significant improvement in „fat percentage‟. But all weight training methods had a positive impact on fat percentage. The most effective exercise method for improving VO2 max, flexibility, and lowering body fat is the superset method with a rest between sets of 30 seconds. The most effective method to increase muscle strength (legs and back) is the compound set method with a rest between sets of 120 seconds.

Treatment includes different steps, including pharmacological treatment aiming to improve the symptom and optimize people’s wellbeing. Areas covered: PubMed and Google Scholar were screened using ‘chronic breathlessness’ OR ‘persistent breathlessness,’ AND ‘pharmacological treatment,’ OR ‘opioids.’ This review focuses on pharmacological treatments to reduce persistent breathlessness and discusses possible mechanisms involved in the process of breathlessness reduction through pharmacotherapy. Research gaps in the field of persistent breathlessness research are outlined, and future research directions are suggested. Expert opinion: Regular, low-dose (≤30 mg/day), sustained-release morphine is recommended as the first-line pharmacological treatment for persistent breathlessness. Inter-individual variation in response needs to be investigated in future studies in order to optimize clinical outcomes. This includes 1) better understanding the centrally mediated mechanisms associated with persisting breathlessness and response to pharmacological therapies, 2) understanding benefit from the perspective of people experiencing persistent breathlessness, small and meaningful gains in physical activity. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; evidence-based care; palliative care; persistent breathlessness; pharmacological treatment; quality of life; suffering; symptom control,"Analgesics, Opioid; Dyspnea; Exercise; Humans; Morphine; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; antidepressant agent; anxiolytic agent; buspirone; furosemide; menthol; morphine; opiate; opiate receptor; narcotic analgesic agent; anxiety; Article; brain region; chronic obstructive lung disease; drug formulation; drug mechanism; dyspnea; human; low drug dose; olfactory system; persistent breathlessness; persistent breathlessness; physical activity; practice guideline; respiration center; respiratory drive; sensory stimulation; treatment response; chronic obstructive lung disease; dyspnea; exercise",Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Impact of Physical Exercise on Mental Health Disorders

Methods: In this prospective cohort study, 14 participants with MS (Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] score = 6.0 to 7.0; mean age = 55.4 [SD = 6.2] years; 71% women) were asked to perform 3 lower extremity resistance exercises (leg press, calf press, and hip abduction) bilaterally twice weekly for 8 weeks using BFR. Feasibility criteria were as follows: enrollment of 20 participants, ≥80% retention and adherence, ≥90% satisfaction, and no serious adverse events related to the intervention. Other outcomes included knee extensor, ankle plantar flexor, and hip abductor muscle strength, 30-Second Sit-to-Stand Test, Berg Balance Scale, Timed 25-Foot Walk Test, 12-Item MS Walking Scale, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, Patient-Specific Functional Scale, and daily step count. Results: Sixteen participants consented, and 14 completed the intervention, with 93% adherence overall. All participants were satisfied with the intervention. A minor hip muscle strain was the only intervention-related adverse event. There were muscle strength improvements on the more-involved (16%-28%) and less-involved (12%-19%) sides. There were also changes in the 30-Second Sit-to-Stand Test (1.9 repetitions; 95% CI = 1.0 to 2.8), Berg Balance Scale (5.3 points; 95% CI = 3.2 to 7.4), Timed 25-Foot Walk Test (-3.3 seconds; 95% CI = -7.9 to 1.3), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (-8.8 points; 95% CI = -16.5 to -1.1), 12-Item MS Walking Scale (-3.6 points; 95% CI = -11.5 to 4.4), Patient-Specific Functional Scale (2.9 points; 95% CI = 1.9 to 3.8), and daily step count (333 steps; 95% CI = -191 to 857). Conclusion: Low-load resistance training using BFR in people with MS and EDSS scores of 6.0 to 7.0 appears feasible, and subsequent investigation into its efficacy is warranted. Impact: Although efficacy data are needed, combining BFR with low-load resistance training may be a viable alternative for people who have MS and who do not tolerate conventional moderate- to high-intensity training because of more severe symptoms, such as fatigue and weakness. Lay Summary: Low-load strength training with BFR was feasible in people who have advanced disability due to MS. Using BFR may provide an alternative for people with MS who do not tolerate higher intensity training due to more severe symptoms, such as fatigue and weakness.  © 2024 The Author(s).",Blood Flow Restriction; Feasibility; Low-Load Resistance Training; Multiple Sclerosis,"Fatigue; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple Sclerosis; Muscle Strength; Muscle, Skeletal; Prospective Studies; Regional Blood Flow; Resistance Training; blood flow; fatigue; feasibility study; female; human; male; middle aged; multiple sclerosis; muscle strength; physiology; prospective study; resistance training; skeletal muscle","""Effects and Applications of Blood Flow Restriction in Exercise Rehabilitation and Performance Enhancement""",Blood Flow Restriction Therapy in Low-Resistance Rehabilitation Exercises,Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation in Osteoarthritis Patients

After this injury, patients are usually referred to physiotherapy for exercise-based rehabilitation. Currently, limited high-quality evidence exists to guide rehabilitation practice and treatment outcomes vary. A full-scale trial comparing different rehabilitation approaches would provide high-quality evidence to inform rehabilitation practice. Whether this full-scale trial is feasible is uncertain: the only previous trial that compared exercise-based programmes in this patient population had high loss to follow-up. This study aims to assess the feasibility of conducting a future full-scale trial comparing the clinical and cost-effectiveness of two different rehabilitation approaches for people with an acute patellar dislocation. Methods: Two-arm parallel external pilot randomised controlled trial and qualitative study. We aim to recruit at least 50 participants aged ≥ 14 years with an acute first-time or recurrent patellar dislocation from at least three English National Health Service hospitals. Participants will be randomised 1:1 to supervised rehabilitation (four to six, one-to-one, physiotherapy sessions of advice and prescription of tailored progressive home exercise over a maximum of 6 months) or self-managed rehabilitation (one physiotherapy session of self-management advice, exercise, and provision of self-management materials). Pilot objectives are (1) willingness to be randomised, (2) recruitment rate, (3) retention, (4) intervention adherence, and (5) intervention and follow-up method acceptability to participants assessed through one-to-one semi-structured interviews (maximum 20 participants). Follow-up data will be collected 3, 6, and 9 months after randomisation. Quantitative pilot and clinical outcomes will be numerically summarised, with 95% confidence intervals generated for the pilot outcomes using Wilson’s and exact Poisson methods as appropriate. Discussion: This study will assess the feasibility of conducting a full-scale trial comparing supervised versus self-managed rehabilitation for people after acute first-time or recurrent patellar dislocation. This full-scale trial’s results would provide high-quality evidence to guide rehabilitation provision for patients with this injury. Trial registration: ISRCTN registry ISRCTN14235231 .

Design: Retrospective cohort study. Methods: Concussion information was extracted from NCAA athlete medical files at LIMBIC MATARS member institutions from the 2015–16’ to 2019–20’ academic years. A total of 410 concussions from 9 institutions were included that provided all independent (i.e. racial identity of Black or White) and dependent variable information (i.e. dates of injury, diagnosis, symptom resolution, and return to sport) that were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U tests. The sample consisted of 114 (27.8%) concussions sustained by Black athletes and 296 (72.1%) sustained by White athletes. Results: The overall sample had a median of 0 days between injury occurrence to diagnosis, 7 days to symptom resolution, and 12 days to return to sport. No significant timing differences were observed for concussion diagnosis (p =.14), symptom resolution (p =.39), or return to sport (p = 0.58) between collegiate athletes with Black versus White racial identities. Conclusions: These findings may reflect equitable access to onsite sports medicine healthcare resources that facilitate concussion management in the collegiate sport setting.

Accordingly, this study investigated the changes in fascicle lengths (FL), popliteal artery velocity, and physical fitness in response to a single bout of DS or NG. Methods: The study included 15 healthy young adults (20.9 ± 0.7 yrs) and 15 older adults (66.6 ± 4.2 yrs) who randomly performed three different interventions (DS, NG, and rest control) for 10 min and 3 days apart. The biceps femoris and semitendinosus FL, popliteal artery velocity, sit and reach (S&R), straight leg raise (SLR), and fast walking speed were measured before and immediately after the intervention. Results: After NG intervention, S&R was largely greater by 2 cm (1.2, 2.8 cm) and 3.4 cm (2.1, 4.7 cm) with largely increased SLR angles of 4.9° (3.7°, 6.1°) and 4.6° (3.0°, 6.2°) with all p < 0.001 for the older adults and young groups, respectively. A similar magnitude improvement in the S&R and SLR testing was also seen for both groups after DS (p < 0.05). Moreover, no changes were seen in FL, popliteal artery velocity, fast gait speed, and age effect following all three intervention occasions. Conclusion: Stretching with DS or NG immediately increased flexibility, which appeared to be largely due to changes in stretch tolerance rather than an increase in fascicle length. Furthermore, age dependency in response to stretching exercise was not seen in the present study. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Dynamic stretching; Hamstrings fascicle length; Neurodynamic gliding; Older adults; Physical performance,"Aged; Hamstring Muscles; Humans; Muscle Stretching Exercises; Muscle, Skeletal; Physical Functional Performance; Range of Motion, Articular; Sports; Young Adult; adult; aged; article; biceps femoris muscle; controlled study; female; fitness; hamstring muscle; human; human experiment; male; nerve; physical performance; popliteal artery; semitendinous muscle; stretching exercise; velocity; walking speed; young adult; physical performance; physiology; range of motion; skeletal muscle; sport; stretching exercise","""Balance, Mobility, and Fall Risks in Aging and Musculoskeletal Conditions""",Impact and Control of Chronic Low Back Pain and Balance in Older Adults,Muscle Strength and Recovery in Sports Performance

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the acute effect of deep dry needling (DP) on lower-limb muscle strength-related variables in CrossTraining recreational athletes with latent trigger point (TrP). Materials and methods. A total of 19 healthy CrossFit®-trained males (27.8 [4.7] years; 79.8 [10.4] kg; 1.76 [0.07] cm) with myofascial TrP in quadriceps, gluteus or gastrocnemius muscles completed this repeated-measures triple-blind pilot clinical trial. Participants were randomly allocated into either experimental (EG, n = 10) or Sham (SG, n = 9) groups. After allocation, the assessment of lower-limb muscle power (squat jump [SJ] and countermovement jump [CMJ]) and maximal isometric hip abduction and quadriceps strength were measured at baseline and after 48 hours of the intervention. Results. The results are expressed as Δ (SD) [95% CI]; unbiased Cohen’s d [dunb, 95% CI]). DN has been shown to reduce the presence of muscle TrP. The maximal isometric hip abduction strength had a moderate-to-high significant increase in the EG (left: 21.5 (16.9) [9.42, 33.57]; 0.55 [0.19, 0.99], right: 20.3 (16.2) [8.70, 31.89]; 0.74 [0.25, 1.35]); however, the Sham group only showed significant improvement in the left hip abductor muscles 15.77 (15.37) [3.96, 27.59]; 0.57 [0.11, 1.12]) with no significant changes in the right side. Conclusions. The acute reduction of myofascial TrP was observed with the application of DN but had no significant effect on maximal isometric strength or jump height compared to the Sham group. Results of this pilot clinical trial can be used to commission future research. © Rojas-Jaramillo, A., Quintero-Lotero, D., García-Torres, C., Petro, J.L., & Bonilla, D.A., 2023.",dry needling; muscle strength; trigger area; trigger point,,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Muscle Strength and Recovery in Sports Performance

Methods: In this sub-analysis of the ADAPT study, PROMs were assessed using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Block step-up (BS) transfers were assessed by wearable-derived measures of time. 76 patients undergoing TJA were included. Subgroups were formed isolating the worst performing quartile (low functioning (LF)) from the high functioning (HF), and outcomes were compared– Results: One-year post-surgery, WOMAC function demonstrated strong correlations to WOMAC pain (Pearson’s r = 0.67–0.84) and moderate correlations to BS performance (Pearson’s r = 0.31–0.54). Both WOMAC and BS significantly improved with a larger effect size for the HF subgroup (0.62 vs. 0.43; p < 0.05). Patients designated to the LF subgroup at 3 months had increased odds of representing the LF subgroup at 12 months (WOMAC = 19; BS = 4). WOMAC defined 18 LF patients at 12 months follow-up. BS performance identified 9 additional LF patients. Conclusions: WOMAC function scores seem pain dominated. Measures of BS performance allow assessment of otherwise hidden residual functional impairment. Lower functioning 3 months post-surgery is predictive of longer-term impairment. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Arthroplasty; outcome assessment; patient reported outcome measures; performance-based test; WOMAC,,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Hip Arthroscopy Outcomes and Rehabilitation

In most cases, conservative treatment is successful. Nonetheless, there are cases where surgical intervention is necessary. We analyzed five surgical cases treated in our department and performed a literature review. Case presentations: Five women, ranging in age from 25 to 38, who experienced peripartum symphysis rupture were primarily treated with a conservative approach. Patients who did not show improvement and met certain criteria, such as experiencing pain starting from childbirth, having a separation in the pubic bone of more than 10 mm, and/or having a vertical instability greater than 5 mm, were recommended to undergo surgery. The average length of time between childbirth and surgery was 5.6 months, ranging from 1 to 14 months. One patient was treated with an external fixator, another patient received a combination of an external fixator and an anterior plate, and three patients were treated with anterior plates. In four cases, we observed a failure in fixation and a partial or complete loss of reduction. The plate and screws were removed in one case, and in three cases, revision surgery was performed. One case involved using a larger plate, while the other used 90-90 plating, known as “box plate fixation.” The mean follow-up was 7.4 years. Two cases had good results, and two had excellent results on the Lindahl scale. Conclusion: For patients with peripartum pubic symphyseal dislocation, our case series and literature review demonstrated that early reduction and fixation correlate with improved clinical outcomes and lower implant failure. For patients with subacute/chronic injuries, there was a higher incidence of implant failure. Orthogonal plate fixation and/or pubic symphysiodesis was associated with improved clinical outcomes. © 2023, The Author(s).",Childbirth; Pelvic girdle pain; Peripartum; Postoperative complications; Pregnancy complications; Pubic symphysis diastasis; Symphysis disruption; Symphysis separation,analgesic agent; adult; age distribution; anterior posterior axis; Article; case report; childbirth; clavicle fracture; clinical article; clinical outcome; closed luxation reduction; conservative treatment; female; follow up; fracture external fixation; hospital admission; hospital discharge; human; implant complication; labor pain; Lindahl scale; low back pain; musculoskeletal disease assessment; open reduction (procedure); osteosynthesis; pelvic girdle pain; pelvis radiography; pelvis surgery; perinatal period; plate fixation; postoperative complication; postoperative period; pregnancy complication; pubic symphysiodesis; pubic symphysis diastasis; pubis; rehabilitation care; reoperation; rest; retrospective study; sacroiliac joint; surgical approach; therapy delay; time to treatment; treatment failure; vaginal delivery,"""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Injury Risk and Performance in Athletes

Hip fractures are perceived as one of the most severe consequences of such falls and are often described as “the last fracture in one’s life,” with mortality rates reaching 20%−30% and accompanied by a significant rate of disability. To address this pressing issue, our study conducted an in-depth analysis of the mechanical properties of Artificial Cartilage Foam (ACF) and Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP). Based on this research, we devised a laminated structure where ACF acts as the outer layer, with CFRP positioned centrally, capitalizing on the material’s intrinsic shock-absorbing attributes. Building on this structure, based on this structure, a specialized protective clothing design tailored for the elderly to counteract age-related balance impairments is proposed. Furthermore, we undertook experiments to gage user anxiety levels and assess the wearability comfort of the attire. Our findings indicate that this protective garment can effectively absorb the impact energy generated during falls, significantly reducing the risk of injury in the elderly. Additionally, its ergonomic design helps alleviate the psychological distress elderly individuals may experience due to the fear of falling. This research presents an innovative and effective strategy for enhancing fall protection in the elderly demographic. © The Author(s) 2024.",Artificial Cartilage Foam (ACF); Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP); clothing design; composite materials; fall impact experiments; fall protection; The elderly,Age; Design; Energy; Foam; Protection; Protective Clothing; Reinforcement; Research; Cartilage; Population statistics; Reinforcement; Artificial cartilage foam; Artificial cartilages; Carbon fiber reinforced polymer; Carbon fibre reinforced polymer; Clothing design; Composites material; Fall impact experiment; Fall protection; Impact experiment; The elderly; Foams,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

This paper aims to evaluate the immediate effects induced by HIFT on blood lactate levels, physical performance in terms of body stability and jump ability, and cognitive performance in terms of reaction time. Nineteen well-trained participants were enrolled in the experimental studies and asked to execute six repetitions of a circuit training. Data were gathered both in a pre-training session and after each one of the circuit repetitions. An immediate significant increase with respect to the baseline was observed during the first repetition, with a further increase after the third one. No effects on jump ability were found, whereas a deterioration in body stability was found.

The studies recognize the association between the stomatognathic and visual systems. This compound may have a neurological basis associated with disorders such as central sensitization. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of central sensitization on the bioelectrical activity of selected muscles of the masticatory organ in subjects with myopia. Methods: Selected masticatory and cervical spine muscles were analyzed using an eight-channel BioEMG III electromyograph. Central sensitization was analyzed using the central sensitization inventory. Results: Statistical analysis revealed significantly higher scores on the central sensitization inventory in subjects with axial myopia compared to subjects without refractive error. Repeated positive correlations were observed in the sternocleidomastoid muscle activity and negative correlations in the digastric muscle activity during open and closed eyes in myopic subjects. Conclusions: Subjects with myopia have an increased score in the central sensitization inventory. The increase in the central sensitization inventory score is connected with the changes within the electromyographic activity of the masticatory and neck muscles. The effect of central sensitization on masticatory muscle activity in myopic subjects requires further study. © 2023 by the authors.,central nervous system sensitization; central sensitization inventory; masticatory muscles; myopia; neurology; optometry; oral medicine; sEMG; temporomandibular joint; vision,Central Nervous System Sensitization; Electromyography; Humans; Masseter Muscle; Masticatory Muscles; Myopia; Neck Muscles; correlation; eye disease; movement; muscle; nervous system; neurology; physical activity; adult; Article; best corrected visual acuity; comparative study; controlled study; digastric muscle; electromyogram; exploratory research; eye axis length; eye refraction; female; human; intraocular pressure; major clinical study; male; masseter muscle; masticatory muscle; muscle contraction; myopia; neck muscle; sternocleidomastoid muscle; surface electromyography; temporalis muscle; temporomandibular joint; central nervous system sensitization; electromyography; masticatory muscle; physiology,"""Effects of Different Therapeutic Interventions on Muscular and Neural Health""",Muscle Rehabilitation and Training Effects in Injury Recovery,Muscle Strength and Recovery in Sports Performance

Fifty resistance untrained women were pair-matched according to baseline strength and randomized to either a full-body (FB) routine that trained all of the major muscle groups in one session twice per week, or a split-body program (SPLIT) that performed 4 weekly sessions (2 upper body and 2 lower body). Both groups performed the same exercises and weekly number of sets and repetitions. Each exercise was performed with three sets and 8–12 repetition maximum (RM) loading. Study outcomes included maximal strength, muscle mass, jump height and maximal power output. Results: No between-group differences were found in any of the variables. However, both FB and SPLIT increased mean 1-RM from pre- to post-test in the bench press by 25.5% versus 30.0%, lat pulldown by 27.2% versus 26.0% and leg press by 29.2% versus 28.3%, respectively. Moreover, both FB and SPLIT increased jump height by 12.5% versus 12.5%, upper-body power by 20.3% versus 16.7% and muscle mass by 1.9% versus 1.7%, p < 0.01, respectively. Conclusions: This study did not show any benefits for split-body resistance-training program compared to full-body resistance training program on measures of maximal- and explosive muscle strength, and muscle mass.

New technologies offer opportunities to combine various systems and use them for sports-related scientific purposes. For instance, examining the visual perception of athletes within a standardized environment could be helpful to understand the differences between novices and experts in their visual behavior and could further reveal possible training applications for enhancing athletes’ visual attention. The current systematic literature review thematizes the importance of eye-tracking (ET) systems’ usage integrated into head-mounted displays (HMDs) in virtual environments for further inclusion in sports-related usage. An overview of possible implementations is given, and additional recommendations for using the combined technic regarding sports are made. Although only one study examined gaze behavior during sports activity within a standardized virtual environment, 38 relevant papers were identified using the ET systems integrated into the HMDs, which ideas can be transferred to the sports sector. The increased usability and fidelity in the virtual environment enabled through the combined technology were illustrated, and different approaches were listed in using and calculating gaze parameters. This literature review examines the possibility of integrating ET in VR, which can be further used to improve usability, interaction methods, image presentation, and visual perception analyses within future physical training scenarios. The compiled studies have shown that the existing methods are feasible due to the performance of the integrated ET systems but still need to be improved for practical use. © 2022, The Author(s).",Eye-tracking; Gaze behavior; Head-mounted display; Virtual reality; Visual perception,Behavioral research; Helmet mounted displays; Image enhancement; Sports; Virtual reality; Eye tracking systems; Eye-tracking; Gaze behaviours; Head-mounted-displays; Immersive virtual reality; Rehabilitation training; Sports trainings; Systematic Review; Training applications; Visual perception; Eye tracking,"""Virtual Reality and Exergames in Rehabilitation and Exercise""",Virtual Reality Interventions in Motor Rehabilitation and Sports for Older Adults,Impact of Visual and Virtual Reality Interventions in Sports and Rehabilitation

This study explored the impacts of regular LTPA behaviour on co-morbidity, adiposity, cardiorespiratory fitness and QoL among male midlife sports club members in a Nigerian population. Methods: This cross-sectional study involved 174 age-matched male midlife adults: 87 engaging in LTPA (LTPA group) and 87 not engaging in LTPA (non-LTPA group). Information on age, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), resting heart rate (RHR), QoL and co-morbidity level was collected using standardized procedures. Data were summarized using mean and standard deviation, and explored using frequency and proportion. Independent t-test, Chi Square and Mann–Whitney U test were employed to determine the impacts of LTPA at 0.05 significance level. Results: The LTPA group had lower co-morbidity score (p = 0.05) and RHR (p = 0.004), and higher QoL (p = 0.01) and VO2max (p = 0.003) than non-LTPA group. While heart disease (χ2 = 10.99; p = 0.01) and hypertension (χ2 = 15.24; p = 0.004) severity levels were associated with LTPA behaviour, hypertension (p = 0.01) was the only co-morbid condition that had a significantly lower score in the LTPA group than in the non-LTPA group. Conclusions: Regular LTPA improves cardiovascular health, physical work capacity and QoL in the sample of Nigerian mid-life men.

When unstable and without substantial comminution, treatment options include closed-reduction percutaneous pinning (CRPP) and open-reduction internal fixation using lag screws (ORIF-screws). The aims of this study are primarily to compare the functional outcomes and complication rates between these techniques and secondarily to assess potential factors affecting outcomes after surgery. Methods: All patients with long oblique extra-articular proximal phalanx fractures treated surgically within a single orthopedic institution from 2010 to 2017 were identified. Outcome measures and complications were assessed at the final follow-up. Results: Sixty patients were included in the study with a mean time to the final follow-up of 41 weeks (range: 12-164 weeks). Thirty-four patients (57%) were treated with CRPP and 26 patients (43%) with ORIF-screws. The mean Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score across both fixation types was 8 (range: 0-43) and did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Mean proximal interphalangeal extension at the final follow-up was 9° short of full extension after CRPP and 13° short of full extension after ORIF-screws. The rates of flexion contracture and extensor lag were 15% and 41% in the CRPP group compared with 12% and 68% in the ORIF-screws group. Reoperation rates and complication rates did not differ significantly between fixation strategies. Conclusions: Acceptable outcomes can be achieved after surgical fixation of long oblique extra-articular proximal phalanx fractures using both CRPP and ORIF-screws. Extensor lag may be more common after ORIF-screws. © The Author(s) 2021.",diagnosis; finger; fracture/dislocation; hand; research and health outcomes; trauma; treatment,"Fracture Fixation, Internal; Fracture Fixation, Intramedullary; Fractures, Bone; Humans; Open Fracture Reduction; Treatment Outcome; fracture; human; intramedullary nailing; open fracture reduction; osteosynthesis; procedures; treatment outcome","""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Shoulder Surgery Outcomes and Measures

Although there is a low risk of serious complications in patients with normal hip joint development even without suturing of the joint capsule, for patients with a preoperative high risk of anterior instability—including those with excessive anteversion of the acetabulum or femur, borderline dysplasia of the hip, and hip arthroscopic revision surgery with an anterior defect of the joint capsule—capsulotomy without repair will result in postoperative anterior instability of the hip joint and related symptoms. Capsular suturing techniques that provide anterior stabilization will be of great help for these high-risk patients and reduce the possibility of postoperative anterior instability.

Although its effects on spatiotemporal gait parameters, such as walking speed and step width, have already been studied, little is currently known about the impact of smartphone dual tasking on lower limb kinetics. Research question: Does smartphone use during walking alter gait patterns (i.e., walking speed and step width) and consequently external knee moments? Methods: In a four-period crossover trial, external knee moment peaks, walking speed, and step width were assessed in 27 healthy adults during matched-speed walking, self-paced walking, self-paced walking with spoken calculation tasks, and self-paced walking with smartphone-entered calculation tasks. Differences between the smartphone use condition and all other conditions were determined using repeated measures ANOVA with predefined contrasts. Results: Decreased walking speed and increased step width were observed during smartphone use. The mean external knee abduction moment peak (Nm/kg) differed significantly (p < 0.01) across the intervention condition, namely walking with smartphone-entered calculations (0.15; 95 % CI: 0.12, 0.18), and the control conditions, namely matched-speed walking (0.11; 95 % CI: 0.08, 0.13), self-paced walking (0.11; 95 % CI: 0.09, 0.14), and walking with spoken calculations (0.14; 95 % CI: 0.12, 0.16). After confounder adjustment for walking speed, step width, gender, and age, this primary outcome was significantly different between using the smartphone and self-paced walking (p < 0.01, r = 0.51). This effect size was reduced when comparing smartphone use with spoken calculations (p = 0.04, r = 0.32). Conclusion: When using a smartphone while walking, walking speed is slowed down, step width is increased, and knee moments are adversely altered compared to walking without dual tasking. These altered knee moments are partially, but not entirely, attributable to the cognitive calculation task. These effects are age-independent, but women are more affected than men. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether sustained walking while using a smartphone adversely affects the development of knee joint pathologies. © 2023 The Authors",3D gait analysis; Instrumented treadmill; Knee abduction moment; Smartphone walking; Split-belt treadmill,,"""Application of Machine Learning and Biomechanics in Musculoskeletal Health and Wearable Devices""","Knee Assessment and Recovery: Validity, Reliability, and Clinical Trials",Wearable Devices and Techniques in Gait Analysis and Mobility Rehabilitation

It has been shown to be effective in improving postural control but there are no recommendations for the usage of the sides. Our aim was to examine leg muscle activity and kinematics in response to a single-leg stance on the two sides of the Togu Jumper and the floor. Methods: In 14 female subjects, linear acceleration of leg segments, segmental angular sway, and myoelectric activity of 8 leg muscles were recorded in the three stance conditions. Results: Except gluteus medius and gastrocnemius medialis, all muscles were more active when balancing on either Togu Jumper side compared to the floor (p < 0.001), but there was no difference between the two sides in any muscles. Linear acceleration was the greatest in the frontal plane on the flat Togu side in the case of the foot (p < 0.001). Pelvis acceleration was unaffected by the balance conditions. Segmental angular sway was the greatest in the frontal plane, on the bladder side in the foot segment (p < 0.001). No difference was found among the three conditions (all p > 0.05) in the case of the shank, thigh, and pelvis. Conclusion: The use of the two Togu Jumper sides produced different balance strategies in the foot segment and induced no difference in equilibrium procedures at the level of the pelvis.

Although trackers from popular brands have frequently been validated, the accuracy of low-cost devices under free-living conditions has not been adequately determined. Objective: To investigate the criterion validity of smartphones and low-cost wrist-worn activity trackers under free-living conditions. Methods: Participants wore a waist-worn Yamax pedometer and seven different low-cost wrist-worn activity trackers continuously over 3 days, and an activity log was completed at the end of each day. At the end of the study, the number of step counts reflected on the participants’ smartphone for each of the 3 days was also recorded. To establish criterion validity, step counts from smartphones and activity trackers were compared with the pedometers using Pearson’s correlation coefficient, mean absolute percentage error, and intraclass correlation coefficient. Results: Five of the seven activity trackers underestimated step counts and the remaining two and the smartphones overestimated step counts. Criterion validity was consistently higher for the activity trackers (r = .78–.92; mean absolute percentage error 14.5%–36.1%; intraclass correlation coefficient: .51–.91) than the smartphone (r = .37; mean absolute percentage error 55.7%; intraclass correlation coefficient: .36). Stratified analysis showed better validity of smartphones among female than for male participants. Phone wearing location also affected accuracy. Conclusions: Low-cost trackers demonstrated high accuracy in recording step counts and can be considered with confidence for research purposes or large-scale health promotion programs. The accuracy of using a smartphone for measuring step counts was substantially lower. Factors such as phone wear location and gender should also be considered when using smartphones to track step counts. © 2023 Human Kinetics, Inc.",mobile phone; pedometer; physical activity; step counts; wearables,,"""Application of Machine Learning and Biomechanics in Musculoskeletal Health and Wearable Devices""","Knee Assessment and Recovery: Validity, Reliability, and Clinical Trials",Wearable Devices and Techniques in Gait Analysis and Mobility Rehabilitation

Objective: The objective of this study is (1) to provide epidemiological information on hand injuries and their patterns and (2) to visualise the frequencies of affected areas of the hand in relation to the most common trauma mechanisms using color-coded heatmaps. Methods: This prospective single-center observational trial conducted at a surgical emergency department in Germany collected data of hand trauma patients using a standardized documentation form. Demographic data, trauma-related data, diagnostic and therapeutic measures were analyzed. Color-coded heatmaps were generated marking anatomic danger zones. Results: 435 patients with a mean age of 39.5 were included. Most patients admitted on their own initiative (79%). Leisure and sport injuries were most frequent (75%). Digiti II–V were injured most commonly (43%), followed by metacarpals (19%) and the thumb (14%). Blunt trauma and cuts accounted for most injuries (74%). Hand-graphics depicted color-coded frequencies of the affected areas of the palmar and dorsal aspect of the hand for the most common types of injury, as well as the most frequent circumstances of accident. Elective surgery was recommended in 25% of cases, and hand surgical follow-up was proposed in over 50% of cases. Conclusions: The dorsal aspect of the hand including the 5th metacarpal, the radial wrist and thenar region, as well as the fingertips of Digiti II/III represent anatomic danger zones to injury of the hand. Due to the large variety of potentially injured structures, diagnosis and treatment is not trivial. Specific training is required for all surgical specialties in emergency care, to increase quality of diagnostic work-up and management of hand injuries. © 2022, The Author(s).",Emergency department; Hand surgery; Hand trauma center; Plastic surgery; Trauma registry; Trauma surgery,"Adult; Emergency Service, Hospital; Germany; Hand Injuries; Humans; Prospective Studies; Tertiary Healthcare; adult; Article; blunt trauma; clinical examination; controlled study; demographics; diagnostic procedure; disease assessment; elective surgery; emergency care; emergency ward; epidemiological data; female; follow up; Germany; groups by age; hand injury; health care quality; health care utilization; hospital admission; human; leisure; major clinical study; male; medical documentation; medical information; observational study; patient care; prospective study; sex ratio; sport injury; tertiary care center; thumb; hand injury; hospital emergency service; tertiary health care","""Pain Management and Musculoskeletal Health in Various Populations""",Chronic Pain Management and Treatment Studies,Management and Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

The clinical onset is mainly bulbar or spinal. Considering that there is no effective medical treatment, there is a need to understand the muscle activation patterns to design better physical exercise routines. The objective of this study was to determine muscle strength and fatigue in patients with ALS performing a unilateral exercise, and according to sex and type of ALS. A cross-sectional, analytical study was conducted with 23 patients. Five maximal unilateral isometric contractions were performed with the right and left biceps brachii. Muscle activation was calculated by surface electromyography bilaterally in the biceps brachii, triceps brachii, rectus femoris anterior, and tibialis anterior. The results showed more accentuated fatigue in men than in women, between the first and last contractions performed and especially on the dominant side (p = 0.016). In addition, there was evidence of a coactivation effect on the muscles around the work joint, which reflects a growing activation of synergists, regardless of sex or type of ALS. These findings support the use of systematic and extensive resistance exercise as a non-invasive option for maintaining the functional capacity of patients with ALS. © 2022 by the authors.",exercise; fatigue; muscle strength; muscular activity; surface electromyography,,"""Muscle Strength, Endurance, and Injury Risk in Upper-Extremity Sports Performance""",Muscular Strength and Injury Risk in Athletes,Muscle Strength and Recovery in Sports Performance

There is an increasing amount of evidence associating ACL rupture to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and SNPs in the collagen type I genes can change its expression and tissue mechanical features. This study aimed to investigate the association between SNPs in COL1A1 and COL1A2 with sports-related ACL tears. Methods: A total of 338 athletes from multiple sports modalities were analyzed: 146 were diagnosed with ACL rupture or underwent an ACL reconstruction surgery and 192 have no musculoskeletal injuries. SNPs were genotyped using validated TaqMan assays. The association of the polymorphisms with ACL rupture was evaluated by a multivariable logistic regression model, using odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: The age, sport modality, and training location were associated with an increased risk of a non-contact ACL tear. COL1A2 SNPs (rs42524 CC and rs2621215 GG) were associated with an increased risk of non-contact ACL injury (6 and 4-fold, respectively). However, no significant differences were detected in the distribution of COL1A1 rs1107946 and COL1A2 rs412777 SNPs between cases and controls. There was a protective association with ACL rupture (OR = 0.25; 95% CI = 0.07–0.96) between COL1A1 rs1107946 (GT or TT) and the wildtype genotypes of the three COL1A2 (rs412777, rs42524, rs2621215). COL1A2 rs42524 and rs2621215 SNPs were associated with non-contact ACL risk. Conclusion: The combined analysis of COL1A1-COL1A2 genotypes suggests a gene-gene interaction in ACL rupture susceptibility. © 2022, The Author(s).",ACL rupture; Athletes; Collagen; Polymorphisms,"Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Athletes; Case-Control Studies; Collagen Type I; Humans; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors; Rupture; collagen type 1; collagen type 1; adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; Article; athlete; Brazilian; case control study; COL1A1 gene; COL1A2 gene; controlled study; disease association; female; gene; genetic association; genotype; groups by age; human; major clinical study; male; reconstructive surgery; single nucleotide polymorphism; validation process; young adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament injury; diagnostic imaging; genetics; risk factor; rupture; single nucleotide polymorphism; surgery","""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction and Outcome Factors

One of the aspects of health most affected in patients infected by COVID-19 was mental health. Leading organizations worldwide have recommended physical activity as one of the main actions. Objective. To analyze the effect of a short-term aerobic training program on biological and mental health and quality of life indicators in post-Covid-19 patients. Methods. Symptomatology of depression, anxiety, stress, quality of life, vital signs, physical fitness and body composition were measured in 10 post COVID-19 patients. An aerobic physical exercise program was applied at 40-60% intensity, five days a week, 50 minutes per session for four weeks. Results. A 30% decrease in depression symptomatology, 58% in stress and 44% in anxiety was found during the intervention period (p<0.001). Regarding the perception of quality of life, the psychological area was the one that presented a positive effect during the intervention (p=0.035). An increase in leg strength (p=0.018) and a decrease in body fat (p=0.005) were found during the intervention. Conclusion.

Nevertheless, the activity of lower-leg muscles has never been compared to each other during functional tests performed with destabilization. The objectives were i) to compare the electromyographic activity between the lower-leg muscles during four functional tests performed with ankle destabilization, and ii) to determine sex-related differences in neuromuscular activation. Twenty-six healthy volunteers (13 males, 13 females) performed the modified Star Excursion Balance Test (mSEBT), unipedal balance and weight-bearing inversion and eversion tests with a destabilizing device, while recording electromyographic activity of the peroneus longus and brevis, tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius lateralis and gluteus medius. The activity of peroneal muscles was significantly greater than other muscles during all functional tests. Furthermore, the anterior direction of the mSEBT was the one implying the greatest activity of the peroneus longus muscle compared to the posteromedial (p=0.003) or posterolateral (p<0.001) directions. Finally, no significant sex-related differences in neuromuscular activity were reported. This study highlights the effectiveness of the destabilizing device to involve specifically the peroneal muscles when performing various functional tests. This device should be used by clinicians to be more specific to the stabilizers of the ankle joint during functional exercises.  © 2023. Thieme.

Some evidence even suggests that WBC has benefits on mental health (depression, anxiety disorders) and cognitive functions in both adults and older adults, due to increased circulating BDNF levels. Recently, some safety concerns have been expressed by influential public health authorities (e.g., FDA, INSERM) based on reports from patients who developed adverse events upon or following WBC treatment. However, part of the data used to support these claims involved individuals whose entire body (except head) was exposed to extreme cold vaporized liquid nitrogen while standing in a narrow bathtub. Such a procedure is known as partial-body cryotherapy (PBC), and is often erroneously mistaken to be whole-body cryotherapy. Although having similarities in terms of naming and pursued aims, these two approaches are fundamentally different. The present article reviews the available literature on the main safety concerns associated with the use of true whole-body cryotherapy. English- and French-language reports of empirical studies including case reports, case series, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified through searches of PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science electronic databases. Five case reports and two RCTs were included for a total of 16 documented adverse events (AEs). A critical in-depth evaluation of these AEs (type, severity, context of onset, participant’s medical background, follow-up) is proposed and used to illustrate that WBC-related safety risks are within acceptable limits and can be proactively prevented by adhering to existing recommendations, contraindications, and commonsense guidelines. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Adverse events; International consortium; Scoping review; Whole-Body Cryotherapy/Cryostimulation (WBC),Aged; Cryotherapy; Exercise; Humans; acetylsalicylic acid; antiinflammatory agent; brain derived neurotrophic factor; clonidine; liquid nitrogen; nimodipine; abdominal aortic dissection; analgesia; anxiety disorder; aortic dissection; arthritis; Article; brain hemorrhage; chronic pain; cognition; cold panniculitis; cryotherapy; depression; disease severity; dizziness; exercise recovery; fibromyalgia; follow up; Food and Drug Administration; headache; high intensity exercise; human; hypertension; information processing; mental health; moyamoya disease; partial body cryotherapy; patient safety; practice guideline; protocol compliance; public health service; randomized controlled trial (topic); rheumatic disease; risk assessment; shivering; sleep quality; systematic review; transient global amnesia; treatment indication; treatment outcome; urticaria; whole body cryostimulation; whole body cryotherapy; aged; exercise; procedures,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation in Osteoarthritis Patients

However, it remains unclear how these altered joint kinematics during jump landing negatively affect ankle joint health in the CAI population. Calculating joint energetics may offer an important method to estimate the magnitude of lower extremity joint loading during functional movements in participants with CAI. Objective: To determine differences in energy dissipation and generation by the lower extremity during maximal jump landing and cutting among groups with CAI, copers, and controls. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: Forty-four participants with CAI, 44 copers, and 44 controls. Main Outcome Measures(s): Kinematics and kinetics of the lower extremity and ground reaction force data were collected during a maximal jump-landing and cutting task. The product of angular velocity in the sagittal plane and joint moment data represented joint power. Energy dissipation and generation by the ankle, knee, and hip joints were calculated by integrating regions of the joint power curve. Results: Participants with CAI displayed reduced ankle energy dissipation (35.9% 6 10.1%) and generation (31.6% 6 12.8%; P, .01) compared with copers (dissipation ¼ 43.6% 6 11.1%; generation ¼ 40.4% 6 12.0%) and controls (dissipation ¼ 41.3% 6 11.1%; generation ¼ 39.6% 6 12.0%) during maximal jump landing and cutting. Participants with CAI also displayed greater energy dissipation at the knee (45.1% 6 9.1%) than copers (39.7% 6 9.5%) during the loading phase and greater energy generation at the hip than controls (36.6% 6 16.8% versus 28.3% 6 12.8%) during the cutting phase. However, copers displayed no differences in joint energetics compared with controls. Conclusions: Participants with CAI displayed differences in both energy dissipation and generation by the lower extremity during maximal jump landing and cutting. However, copers did not show altered joint energetics, which may represent a coping mechanism to avoid further injuries. © 2023 National Athletic Trainers' Association Inc..

However, there is a paucity of literature investigating midterm outcomes comparing athletes with Controls. Hypothesis: Athletes would have significant improvements at 5 years, with favorable outcomes compared with their control counterparts, and high return-to-sport (RTS) rate. Study Design: Propensity-matched retrospective comparative cohort study. Level of Evidence: Level 3. Methods: CAs who underwent primary HA for FAIS from January 1, 2012 to April 30, 2017 were identified and propensity matched on a 1:4 basis to Controls by age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were collected preoperatively and at 5 years. Minimal clinically important differences (MCID) and patient acceptable symptom states (PASS) rates were calculated using previously published thresholds. Rate and duration of RTS were collected retrospectively. Results: A total of 57 high-level CA (33 female, 24 male; age, 21.7 ± 4.2 years; BMI, 23.1 ± 2.8 kg/m2) were propensity matched to 228 Controls (132 female, 96 male; P > 0.99; age, 23.3 ± 5.8 years; P = 0.02; BMI, 23.8 ± 4.3 kg/m2, P = 0.24).

Both groups demonstrated significant postoperative improvements in all outcome scores measured (P ≤ 0.01). At 5 years postoperatively, there were significant differences between groups in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Pain (CA, 17.3 ± 17.6 vs Controls, 24.7 ± 25.9; P = 0.02). There were no significant differences in achieving MCID or PASS. Athletes RTS at a median of 25.2 weeks (Q1 22.4-Q3 30.7) with an overall RTS rate of 90%. Similar rates of revision were seen between CA patients (n = 3; 5.3%) and Control patients (n = 9; 3.9%) (P = 0.66). Conclusion: CAs demonstrated significant and durable improvements in PROs as well as high MCID and PASS achievement rates after primary HA, which were comparable with those of Controls. Clinicians should be aware that CA patients demonstrate higher preoperative mHHS and HOS-ADL scores than Controls and achieve lower average self-reported pain at 5 years postoperatively. In addition, CA patients demonstrate high rates of RTS at a median of 25 weeks postoperatively. Clinical Relevance: This study provides insight into CA versus Control PROs and rates of achieving MCID and PASS at a midterm follow-up of 5 years. Furthermore, this study offers perception into RTS rate, both in general as well as specified to individualized sports. © 2023 The Author(s).",athletes; femoroacetabular impingement; hip arthroscopy; return to sport,,"""Hip Arthroscopy: Procedures, Outcomes, and Associated Technologies""",Hip Arthroscopy and Outcomes Analysis,Hip Arthroscopy Outcomes and Rehabilitation

While BA3D is considered the gold standard, it requires substantial investments, whereas BA2D is cost-effective and increasingly employed in clinical settings. The primary aim of this study was to establish correlations between sagittal plane angles derived from BA2D and BA3D for the pelvis, hip, knee, and ankle during the initial contact phase of running. Methods: Twelve runners, consisting of six females (34.0 ± 5.0 years, 53.0±9.5 kg, and 162.0±6.0 cm) and six males (32.0±3.0 years, 70.0±6.2 kg, and 175.0±8.0 cm), underwent initial contact kinematics assessment using BA3D (Vicon Nexus 1.8 and Polygon 4 plug-in gait model) and BA2D (Kinovea, Version 0.9.3). Correlations between measurements were determined through linear regression (R2), mean differences, Bland & Altman analysis (B&A), Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between BA2D and BA3D, and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: The following results were obtained: Pelvis R2 = 0.67, B&A = 7.32°±3.69°, r = 0.818 (sufficient, p < 0.001); Hip: R2 = 0.48, B&A = 18.39°±5.56°, r = 0.690 (moderate, p = 0.123); Knee: R2 = 0.13, B&A = 2.54°±5.38°, r = 0.364 (insufficient, p < 0.001); Ankle R2 = 0.15, B&A = -4.89°±4.22°, r = 0.386 (insufficient, p < 0.001). ICC for pelvis = 0.470; hip = 0.286; knee = 0.322; ankle = 0.213 (all statistically considered poor). Conclusion: The setup used during data collection can be easily reproduced by other professionals in a clinical setting. A low difference between BA2D and BA3D methods was observed based on B&A analysis. A linear relationship with moderate variability was established according to the Pearson correlation coefficient and coefficient of determination. However, poor agreement between BA3D and BA2D was found, as indicated by ICC. Therefore, caution is warranted when interpreting BA2D results relative to BA3D. The present study does not recommend other researchers to compare their BA2D with BA3D results conducted by different software than those used in our methods, this type of data must be considered individually across studies. © 2023, Editura Universitatii din Pitesti.

Objective: To determine the efficacy of a theoretically driven, personalized health coaching program in participants 50 years and older with one or more chronic conditions using a randomized, controlled, pragmatic clinical trial methodology. Methods: Participants were randomly assigned to the HL (n = 59) or a usual care (n = 63) group. The HL group received health coaching from a trained nurse over eight weeks. Outcomes were measured at baseline, eight weeks, and 20 weeks (after the 12-week no-treatment phase). Regression modeling with fixed-effect repeated measures was used to account for the longitudinal data collection. Results: For the HL group, health habits increased at 8 weeks (3.1 units; SE = 1.0; p =.0005; effect size =.15). This difference was sustained at 20 weeks (2.4 units, SE = 0.2; p =.0005). Independent self-care agency improved at 8 weeks in individuals with high blood pressure (13.5 units; SE = 4.37; p =.0023; effect size =.3). However, that difference was not sustained at 20 weeks (p =.47). No significant improvements were shown in the usual care group at 8 weeks or 20 weeks. Conclusions: HL participants significantly improved their health habits at 8 weeks and sustained this improvement at week 20 (after a 12-week no-treatment phase) vs. the usual care group. Changing health habits alone has been shown to reduce all-cause morbidity and mortality in chronic disease. The high-functioning, community-dwelling older adults with chronic diseases we studied is an important target population for primary care practices to intervene early in aging to stave off the complications of chronic disease and functional decline.

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of multicomponent functional training with postural correction on functional balance in the elderly with a history of falling. Methods: This study was a randomized controlled, single-blind study. Subjects (n = 28, mean age = 70 years) with a history of falling were selected and randomly allocated to either a multicomponent functional training (n = 14) or a control group (n = 14). The experimental group exercised for 8 weeks, three days per week for 60 min per day. The training program with strength, endurance, and balance parts was conducted in the multi-task conditions to stimulate the physical and cognitive abilities focusing on the attentional-correct posture. The control group received conventional care. The Berg balance and short physical performance battery tests were used in the pre-test and post-test. The adjusted post-test means of experimental and control groups were analyzed using the ANCOVA test to eliminate any pretest effects. Results: This study found a significant effect of training on Berg balance test (P = 0.001), Timed Up and Go with D-T (P = 0.01), Timed Up and Go (P = 0.002), and Short Physical Performance Battery (P = 0.001). Conclusions: Eight weeks of multicomponent exercise training has beneficial effects on balance and physical function and results in improved equilibrium and a decreasing probability of falling. Therefore, practitioners can use this 8-week training program for older adults. © 2022, The Author(s).",Aging; Fall; Intervention; Physical activity,aged; aging; analysis of covariance; article; Berg Balance Scale; body position; clinical article; cognition; controlled study; endurance; exercise; female; functional training; human; human experiment; male; physical activity; physical capacity; physician; pretest posttest design; probability; randomized controlled trial; short physical performance battery; single blind procedure; timed up and go test; training,"""Balance, Mobility, and Fall Risks in Aging and Musculoskeletal Conditions""",Impact and Control of Chronic Low Back Pain and Balance in Older Adults,Fall Prevention and Balance Improvement in the Elderly

Methods Ten healthy men were assessed at baseline (∼14 wk before first lockdown) and 17.9 ± 0.3 months later (<1 wk after second lockdown). At both times, physical activity levels, body mass, and quadriceps strength were acquired using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, a force plate, and a dynamometer, respectively. Gait data were also acquired using a motion capture system and force plates during self-paced walking, from which spatiotemporal parameters, knee angles, and external moments were computed. Baseline and follow-up measurements were compared using two-tailed paired t-tests (α = 0.05). Results At follow-up, participants spent less time doing vigorous physical activity (Δ =-76 ± 157 min·wk-1, P = 0.048), exhibited a tendency toward increased sedentary time (Δ = +120 ± 162 min·d-1, P = 0.056), weighed more (Δ = +2.5 ± 2.8 kg, P = 0.021), and showed a trend toward reduced quadriceps strength (Δ =-0.29 ± 0.45 (N·m)·kg-1, P = 0.071) compared with baseline. At follow-up, participants walked slower (Δ =-0.09 ± 0.07 m·s-1, P = 0.005), had greater knee flexion angles at heel strike (Δ = +2.2° ± 1.8°, P = 0.004) and during late stance (Δ = +2.2° ± 1.8°, P = 0.004), had reduced knee extension moments (Δ =-0.09 ± 0.09 (N·m)·kg-1, P = 0.012) and knee internal rotation moments (Δ =-0.02 ± 0.02 (N·m)·kg-1, P = 0.012) during late stance.

A total of 45 people diagnosed with post-stroke were included as study subjects; they were randomized to an AGT training group provided with visual feedback (Group A), a Biorescue training group provided with visual feedback (Group B), and an AGT/Biorescue group that subsequently received AGT training and Biorescue training (Group C). A muscle strength-measuring device was used to evaluate muscle strength. Timed Up and Go and Bug Balance Scale assessment sheets were used to evaluate balance ability. Dartfish software was used to evaluate gait ability. The results of the study showed that Groups A and C had a significant increase in muscle strength compared with Group B; in terms of balance and gait abilities, Group C showed a significant increase in balance ability and gait speed and a significant change in knee joint angle compared with Groups A and B. In conclusion, this study suggests that including a method that applies multiple therapeutic interventions is desirable in the rehabilitation of stroke patients to improve their independence. © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.",feedback; overlapping effects; rehabilitation; stroke,aged; Article; central nervous system disease; cerebral palsy; cerebrovascular accident; clinical article; cognition; cognitive defect; comparative study; controlled study; exercise intensity; extensor muscle; female; gait; hemiplegia; human; informed consent; knee joint; lateral malleolus; male; motor dysfunction; muscle strength; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Parkinson disease; proprioception; rehabilitation care; sitting; standing; stroke patient; visual feedback; walking speed,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Impact of Visual and Virtual Reality Interventions in Sports and Rehabilitation

Only little is known about physiotherapists’ attitude towards digitalization. This study primarily aimed to analyze physiotherapists’ attitude towards digitalization and to what extend digital tools have been implemented into their daily work. In second analysis, participants’ characteristics such as age, working place, gender and mode of survey participation were assessed. Methods: A 12-main-item survey amongst voluntary course participants of one physiotherapeutic training center was conducted via paper-based as well as online questionnaires between July 2018 and June 2019 including questions on participants’ general as well as particular attitude towards digitalization, the use of (mobile) applications and possible advantages and disadvantages of the ongoing digital transformation. Sub-analysis was performed for age (≤40 years versus > 40 years), gender, mode of participation (paper vs. online) and working place (practice vs. hospital). Results: Overall, 488 physiotherapists participated in the survey. In comparison of the age groups, younger participants had more concerns about data security (p = 0.042) and insufficient financial remuneration (p < 0.001). Younger participants stated higher satisfaction with data literacy than their counterparts (p = 0.0001). Physiotherapists working in the outpatient sector, rather than in hospitals, expected digitalization to increase more in relevance (p < 0.001). The online respondents (OG) indicated that they had more knowledge about key aspects of the current legal situation regarding digitalization than participants completing the paper-based survey (p = 0.002). 50.4% of the considered digitalization as useful for their job. Conclusions: The majority of participants saw high potential for digitalization in the physiotherapy sector. Younger physiotherapists seem to be more concerned about data security and insufficient financial remuneration. Physiotherapists in the outpatient sector seem to see more potential in digital transformations. General concerns like missing reimbursement, lack of data security or knowledge on legal frameworks should be addressed in the future. Further studies should focus on identifying specific digital tools which can support physiotherapists. © 2022, The Author(s).",Attitude; Digitalization; Evaluation; Physiotherapy; Work,Adult; Attitude; Humans; Knowledge; Physical Therapists; Physical Therapy Modalities; Surveys and Questionnaires; adult; article; controlled study; female; gender; groups by age; human; information literacy; information security; male; mobile application; outpatient; physiotherapist; physiotherapy; questionnaire; reimbursement; remuneration; satisfaction; attitude; knowledge; physiotherapist; physiotherapy,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Management and Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

This study aims to explore the best exercise combination for diabetic patients and to provide scientific and practical personalized exercise guidance for diabetic patients. Subject and methods: Basic information about participants was obtained through questionnaires, physical measurements were performed, and fasting blood samples were collected. Polar area diagrams were used to analyze the relationship between different exercise habits and each index. The polar area graph showed the exercise duration with the best expected effect under a particular frequency and intensity. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to test whether there was a direct causal relationship between exercise and diabetes. Results: Polar area diagrams showed that diabetes patients who engaged in moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise > 60 minutes five times per week had better health indicators. The polar area graph showed that low-intensity exercise once or twice a week required more than 30 minutes to achieve the desired effect. There was no significant difference in any indicators among elderly diabetic patients with different exercise intensities. Conclusion: Moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise for more than 30 minutes five times a week was the most beneficial combination of exercise for diabetes. Low frequency needs to be matched with longer exercise time to achieve the desired effect at low intensity. The relationship between low frequency and long duration weakened when the exercise intensity increased. The levels of all indicators in elderly diabetic patients were unrelated to exercise intensity. © 2023, The Author(s).",Body composition; Diabetes mellitus; Exercise therapy; Glycemic control,,"""Effects of Exercise and Lifestyle Modification on Diabetes, Obesity, and Cardiovascular Health""",Effects of Exercise Programs on Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Health Outcomes,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

However, the decline in strength surpasses the decline in muscle mass, suggesting that factors in addition to muscle loss, such as neuroplasticity, contribute to the decrease in force production. However, little is known regarding immobilization-induced neural changes, although sensorimotor regions seem to be the most affected. The present study aimed to determine whether brain functional organization is altered following 14 days of unilateral elbow immobilization. Functional organization was quantified using resting-state functional connectivity, a measure of the synchronicity of the spontaneous discharge of different brain regions at rest. Data was obtained from twelve healthy young females before and after completing the immobilization period. A seed-to-voxel analysis was performed using seeds associated with cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar sensorimotor regions of the brain. The results showed changes predominantly involving cerebellar connectivity. For example, the immobilization period caused a decrease in connectivity between the motor cerebellar region of the immobilized arm and the left temporal lobe, and an increase between the same cerebellar region and the supplementary motor area. Overall, changes in connectivity occurred in regions typically associated with error detection and motor learning, suggesting a potential functional reorganization of the brain within 14 days of elbow immobilization. © 2024 IBRO",Female; Limb immobilization; Resting-state functional connectivity,Brain; Brain Mapping; Cerebellum; Elbow; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Motor Cortex; Neural Pathways; adult; article; brain; brain region; cerebellum; clinical article; elbow; female; functional connectivity; human; human experiment; immobilization; motor learning; muscle mass; muscle strength; nerve cell plasticity; normal human; plant seed; supplementary motor area; temporal lobe; brain; brain mapping; diagnostic imaging; elbow; motor cortex; nerve tract; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology,"""Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion: Studies on Impacts, Recovery, and Influences""",Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion Studies in Young Athletes,Muscle Strength and Recovery in Sports Performance

We studied whether depression screenings/psychotherapy visits within 3 months before 1- to 2-level lumbar fusion were associated with lower medical complications, emergency department utilization, readmissions, and health care costs. Methods: The PearlDiver database from 2010 to 2020 was queried for depressive disorder (DD) patients undergoing primary 1- to 2-level lumbar fusion. Two cohorts were 1:5 ratio matched and included DD patients with (n = 2,622) and DD patients without (n = 13,058) a preoperative depression screen/psychotherapy visit within 3 months of lumbar fusion. A 90-day surveillance period was used to compare outcomes. Logistic regression models computed odds ratio (OR) of complications and readmissions. P value < 0.003 was significant. Results: DD patients without depression screening had significantly greater incidence and odds of experiencing medical complications (40.57% vs. 16.00%; OR 2.71, P < 0.0001). Rates of emergency department utilization were increased in patients without screening versus screening (15.78% vs. 4.23%; OR 4.25, P < 0.0001), despite no difference in readmissions (9.31% vs. 9.53%; OR 0.97, P = 0.721). Finally, 90-day reimbursements ($51,160 vs. $54,731) were significantly lower in the screened cohort (all P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Patients who underwent a preoperative depression screening within 3 months of lumbar fusion had decreased medical complications, emergency department utilization, and health care costs.

The aim of this study was to describe and compare factors that could affect well-being among students across Europe. Methods: In this descriptive cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire survey, students of bachelor’s physiotherapy programs from 23 European faculties, from 8 countries, were interviewed on mental health and stress burden, sleep quality, dietary habits, and physical activity. Results: Although 75% of students rated their quality of life positively and 47% were satisfied with their mental health, 65% showed higher levels of stress and 51% described impaired sleep quality. The minimum physical activity of 150 min weekly was described by 79% of students, within which 67% engaged in strengthening twice a week. Students with a higher stress load/worse psychological health also showed worse sleep quality and lower amount of physical activity, women were significantly worse off. In terms of physical activity and sleep quality, students from Finland and Kosovo achieved the best results, while students from Italy, Greece, and Portugal achieved the worst. Students from Italy indicated the greatest dissatisfaction with the organisation of the study system and communication with teachers, while in Kosovo students rated the communication and study organisation the highest. All students had a problem with adhering to nutritional habits. Students from Italy and Spain, with the lowest body mass indexes and weight averages, were closest to the nutrition recommendations. Conclusion: We demonstrated that physiotherapy students are burdened with stress, suffer from sleep disorders, and do not follow the recommendations regarding nutrition nor physical activity. There are significant differences between universities and countries in some aspects.

This systematic review aimed to investigate the risk of digestive events in RA patients treated with UPA. Methods: Systematic searches of electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE) from inception to September 2022 were conducted to locate randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared UPA with control treatment and reported digestive events in RA patients. We pooled data using the random-effects model and meta-analysis was conducted by Stata software. Results: Ten RCTs met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed, with a total of 6103 patients. Compared with conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), pooled analysis of 8 trials revealed no statistical difference in hepatic disorder (HD) risk and gastrointestinal (GI) perforation (GIP) risk ((OR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.56, I2 = 0.00%); OR = 4.49, 95% CI 0.56 to 35.93, I2 = 0.00%)). When we considered the influence of UPA on the grade of liver enzymes, the data indicated that grade 3 and 4 elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were infrequent. Additionally, a dose-dependent impact of UPA on the risks of HD was not observed. The results suggested no interaction by dose of drug, or indication for treatment of GIP risk. Conclusion: Our results showed that RA patients receiving UPA compared with csDMARDs had no significant increased risk associated with digestive events. Further long-term research of emerging data is urgently needed to gain a better understanding of the association between UPA and digestive events in the RA population. © 2023",Gastrointestinal perforation; Hepatic disorder; Rheumatoid arthritis; Upadacitinib,,"""Balance, Mobility, and Fall Risks in Aging and Musculoskeletal Conditions""",Impact and Control of Chronic Low Back Pain and Balance in Older Adults,Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation in Osteoarthritis Patients

Players with a suspected concussion were referred to a study sport medicine physician for diagnosis and management. Multilevel Poisson regression analysis including multiple imputation of missing covariates estimated incidence rate ratios (IRRs).Main Results:A total of 554 game and 63 practice-related concussions were sustained over the 5 years. Female players (IRRFemale/Male = 1.79; 95% CI: 1.26-2.53), playing in lower levels of play (IRR = 1.40; 95% CI: 1.10-1.77), and those with a previous injury (IRR = 1.46; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.88) or lifetime concussion history (IRR = 1.64; 95% CI: 1.34-2.00) had higher rates of game-related concussion.

Female sex was also associated with a higher practice-related concussion rate (IRRFemale/Male = 2.63; 95% CI: 1.24-5.59).Conclusions:In the largest Canadian youth ice hockey longitudinal cohort to date, female players (despite policy disallowing bodychecking), players participating in lower levels of play, and those with an injury or concussion history had higher rates of concussion. Goalies and players in leagues that disallowed bodychecking had lower rates.

Providing appropriate and validated feedback during tackling training in American football may be a mechanism for athletes to learn safe tackling performance. Objective: To determine the effect of video feedback in the instruction of tackling form. Design: Controlled laboratory study. Setting: Laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 32 youth football athletes (28 boys, 4 girls; age ¼ 11.8 6 0.8 years) participated in 1 day of training. Of those, 14 participants completed 2 additional days of training and a 48-hour retention and transfer test. Intervention(s): Video feedback using self as model, expert as model, combined self and expert model, and oral feedback to promote safe tackling performance in a laboratory environment. Main Outcome Measure(s): Shoulder extension, cervical extension, trunk angle, pelvis height, and step length by training block and over time. Results: For the 1-day training group, main effects for time were observed for shoulder extension (P, .01), cervical extension (P ¼ .01), pelvis height (P, .01), and step length (P, .01), with better performance for pelvis height and step length after combined feedback. For the 3-day training group, main effects of time were identified in pelvis height (P, .01) and step length (P, .01), with combined feedback showing better performance than other methods in shoulder extension and pelvis height. Combined feedback resulted in better performance compared with its component parts and oral feedback alone. In the combined model, participants viewed both their performance and the expert model, enabling them to see the difference between current and required performance. Conclusions: Combined feedback may be superior to other forms of feedback in improving movement performance. This effect can be generalized across disciplines that provide instruction and feedback in movement. © by the National Athletic Trainers’ Association, Inc.",concussion; injury prevention; motor learning,Adolescent; Athletes; Child; Feedback; Female; Football; Humans; Male; adolescent; athlete; child; feedback system; female; football; human; male,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Effects of different training methods on athletic performance and injury prevention

There are many resources that people can engage with to help them learn about pain. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the resources with which people with persistent pain engage, to learn about pain. Secondary aims included investigating the helpfulness of those resources, whether people assess the quality of the resources with which they engage and whether the resources sought differed according to whether or not they had a diagnosis for their pain. Design: Cross-sectional descriptive study. Setting: Online and paper-based surveys. Methods: People with persistent pain were recruited through advertising on social media and through local university health clinics. Participants completed a survey providing details about their pain condition, the resources with which they engaged to learn about pain, how useful they found these resources and whether they assessed the quality of the resources used. Results: Data were collected from 127 online surveys (80% female; age [±SD] was 41 [±16] years). Healthcare professionals were the most common resource with which participants engaged (85.0%), followed by the Internet (68.5%) and scientific articles (52.8%). Books and scientific articles had the highest helpfulness rating; healthcare professionals and pamphlets had the lowest. Most respondents (85.3%) reported assessing the quality of the resources they engaged with.

Methods: Eight databases were searched for studies published between 2012 and 2023, and 14 studies were included in this systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA). The NMA was performed using R and Metainsight. Results: Results showed that tai chi and yoga were effective in alleviating chronic pain, but their effects were not superior to traditional physical exercises and other MBEs. In addition, none of the MBEs were shown to be effective in mitigating chronic pain-related disabilities. Conclusion: Tai chi and yoga can be used for relieving chronic pain in older adults; however, MBE programs alone were not sufficient to mitigate chronic pain-related disabilities. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Chronic pain; Mind-body exercises; Network meta-analysis; Older adults; Pain-associated disability,Aged; Chronic Pain; Exercise; Humans; Network Meta-Analysis; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Tai Ji; Yoga; aged; chronic pain; exercise; human; meta analysis; network meta-analysis; randomized controlled trial (topic); Tai Chi; yoga,"""Pain Management and Musculoskeletal Health in Various Populations""",Chronic Pain Management and Treatment Studies,Exercise and Cognitive Function in Aging Adults

Objectives: The aim of this prospective study was to characterize the cardiovascular sequelae of asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic COVID-19 among high/elite-level athletes. Methods: 950 athletes (779 professional French National Rugby League (F-NRL) players; 171 student athletes) were included. SARS-Cov-2 testing was performed at inclusion, and F-NRL athletes were intensely followed-up for incident COVID-19. Athletes underwent ECG and biomarker profiling (D-Dimer, troponin, C-reactive protein). COVID(+) athletes underwent additional exercise testing, echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). Results: 285/950 athletes (30.0%) had mild/asymptomatic COVID-19 [79 (8.3%) at inclusion (COVID(+)prevalent); 206 (28.3%) during follow-up (COVID(+)incident)]. 2.6% COVID(+) athletes had abnormal ECGs, while 0.4% had an abnormal echocardiogram. During stress testing (following 7-day rest), COVID(+) athletes had a functional capacity of 12.8 ± 2.7 METS with only stress-induced premature ventricular ectopy in 10 (4.3%). Prevalence of CMR scar was comparable between COVID(+) athletes and controls [COVID(+) vs. COVID(−); 1/102 (1.0%) vs 1/28 (3.6%)]. During 289 ± 56 days follow-up, one athlete had ventricular tachycardia, with no obvious link with a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The proportion with troponin I and CRP values above the upper-limit threshold was comparable between pre- and post-infection (5.9% vs 5.9%, and 5.6% vs 8.7%, respectively). The proportion with D-Dimer values above the upper-limit threshold increased when comparing pre- and post-infection (7.9% vs 17.3%, P = 0.01). Conclusion: The absence of cardiac sequelae in pauci/asymptomatic COVID(+) athletes is reassuring and argues against the need for systematic cardiac assessment prior to resumption of training (clinicaltrials.gov; NCT04936503). © 2022, The Author(s).",Cardiac MRI; ECG; Echocardiography; SARS-CoV-2; Sport; Stress test,,"""Impacts of COVID-19 on Physical and Mental Health, Exercise Habits, and Rehabilitation Strategies""","Impact of COVID-19 on Health, Physical Activity and Quality of Life",Post-COVID-19 Syndrome and Rehabilitation Strategies

This study compared eccentric and concentric cycling at matched perceived effort and torque for the mental demand and related-cortical activation patterns. Nineteen men (30 ± 6 years) performed four different 5-min cycling conditions at 30 RPM on a semi-recumbent isokinetic cycle ergometer: (1) concentric at a moderate perceived effort (23 on the CR100® scale) without torque feedback; (2) concentric and (3) eccentric at the same average torque produced in the first condition; and (4) eccentric at the same moderate perceived effort than the first concentric condition. The conditions two to four were randomized. After each condition, mental demand was monitored using the NASA Task Load Index scale. Changes in oxy-(O2Hb) and deoxy-(HHb) hemoglobin during exercise were measured over both prefrontal cortices and the right parietal lobe from a 15-probe layout using a continuous-wave NIRS system. Mental demand was significantly higher during eccentric compared to concentric cycling (+52%, p = 0.012) and when the exercise intensity was fixed by the torque rather than the perceived effort (+70%, p < 0.001). For both torque- or perceived effort-matched exercises, O2Hb increased significantly (p < 0.001) in the left and right prefrontal cortices, and right parietal lobe, and HHb decreased in the left, and right, prefrontal cortices during eccentric compared to concentric cycling. This study supports that acute eccentric cycling, compared to concentric cycling, involves a higher mental demand, and frontoparietal network activation. © 2023 The Authors.

Data for twenty individuals with motor complete SCI who completed twice weekly NMES-RT lasting 12–16 weeks as part of their participation in one of two separate clinical trials were pooled and retrospectively analyzed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to measure muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) of the whole thigh and knee extensor muscle before and after NMES-RT. Muscle biopsies and fasting biomarkers were also measured. Following the completion of the respective NMES-RT trials, participants were classified into either high-responders (n = 8; muscle CSA > 20%) or low-responders (n = 12; muscle CSA < 20%) based on whole thigh muscle CSA hypertrophy. Whole thigh muscle and knee extensors CSAs were significantly greater (P < 0.0001) in high-responders (29 ± 7% and 47 ± 15%, respectively) compared to low-responders (12 ± 3% and 19 ± 6%, respectively). There were no differences in total caloric intake or macronutrient intake between groups. Extensor spasticity was lower in the high-responders compared to the low-responders as was the dosage of baclofen. Prior to the intervention, the high-responders had greater body mass compared to the low-responders with SCI (87.8 ± 13.7 vs. 70.4 ± 15.8 kg; P = 0.012), body mass index (BMI: 27.6 ± 2.7 vs. 22.9 ± 6.0 kg/m2; P = 0.04), as well as greater percentage in whole body and regional fat mass (P < 0.05). Furthermore, high-responders had a 69% greater increase (P = 0.086) in total Akt protein expression than low-responders. High-responders also exhibited reduced circulating IGF-1 with a concomitant increase in IGFBP-3. Exploratory analyses revealed upregulation of mRNAs for muscle hypertrophy markers [IRS-1, Akt, mTOR] and downregulation of protein degradation markers [myostatin, MurF-1, and PDK4] in the high-responders compared to low-responders. The findings indicate that body composition, spasticity, baclofen usage, and multiple signaling pathways (anabolic and catabolic) are involved in the differential muscle hypertrophy response to NMES-RT in persons with chronic SCI. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",High-responders; Low-responders; Neuromuscular electrical stimulation resistance training; Skeletal muscle hypertrophy; Spinal cord injury,"Baclofen; Electric Stimulation Therapy; Humans; Hypertrophy; Muscle Spasticity; Muscle, Skeletal; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Resistance Training; Retrospective Studies; Spinal Cord Injuries; baclofen; protein kinase B; electrotherapy; human; hypertrophy; metabolism; pathology; physiology; procedures; resistance training; retrospective study; skeletal muscle; spasticity; spinal cord injury","""Effects of Different Therapeutic Interventions on Muscular and Neural Health""",Muscle Rehabilitation and Training Effects in Injury Recovery,Spinal Cord Injury and Exercise Rehabilitation

Although steroid injection is often used if the conservative treatment fails, Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) injection is gaining popularity due to its safety and long-lasting effect. However, the effect of PRP versus steroid injection in PF has not been studied yet in Nepal. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effect of PRP compared with steroid injection in the treatment of PF. Methods: This study was a single-center, hospital-based, open-label, parallel-group randomized clinical trial to compare the effect of PRP injection with steroid injection in plantar fasciitis between August 2020 and March 2022. A total of 90 randomly selected participants aged 18 to 60 years suffering from plantar fasciitis with failed conservative treatment were intervened. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) and the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scoring system were used to evaluate functional mobility and pain before and after the intervention for three and six months, respectively. Statistical analyses were performed using a Student’s two-sample t-test. P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The PRP injection showed a better outcome than the steroid injection in six months follow-up. The mean (± SD) VAS score was significantly decreased in the PRP group (1.97 + 1.13) than in the steroid group (2.71 ± 0.94) with the group difference of -0.73 (95% CI: -1.18 to -0.28) at six months. Similarly, there was a significant increase in the AOFAS scores in the PRP group (86.04 ± 7.45) compared to the steroid group (81.23 ± 9.60) at six months of follow-up with a group difference of 4.80 (95% CI: 1.15 to 8.45). There was also a significant reduction of plantar fascia thickness in the PRP group compared to that of the steroid group (3.53 ± 0.81 versus 4.58 ± 1.02) at six months of follow-up with the group difference of -1.04 (95% CI: -1.44 to -0.65). Conclusion: The PRP injection showed better outcomes than steroid injection in plantar fasciitis treatment over the course of six months. Further research with a larger population and longer follow-up than six months is needed to generalize the findings and their long-term efficacy. Trial registration: NCT04985396.

Resistance training is considered as an effective approach to reduce the risk of muscle weakness in patients with KOA. Blood flow restriction (BFR) with low-load resistance training has better clinical outcomes than low-load resistance training alone. However, the degree of BFR which works more effectively with low-load resistance training has not been determined. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of different degrees of BFR with low-load resistance training in patients with KOA on pain, self-reported function, physical function performance, muscle strength, muscle thickness, and quality of life. Methods: This is a study protocol for a randomized, controlled trial with blinded participants. One hundred individuals will be indiscriminately assigned into the following groups: two training groups with a BFR at 40% and 80% limb occlusion pressure (LOP), a training group without BFR, and a health education group. The three intervention groups will perform strength training for the quadriceps muscles twice a week for 12 weeks, while the health education group will attend sessions once a week for 12 weeks. The primary outcome is pain. The secondary outcomes include self-reported function, physical function performance, muscle strength of the knee extensors, muscle mass of the quadriceps, quality of life, and adverse events. Intention-to-treat analysis will be conducted for individuals who withdraw during the trial. Discussion: Previous studies have shown that BFR with low-load resistance training is more effective than low-load resistance training alone; however, a high degree of BFR may cause discomfort during training. If a 40% LOP for BFR could produce similar clinical outcomes as an 80% LOP for BFR, resistance training with a low degree of BFR can be chosen for patients with KOA who are unbearable for a high degree of BFR.

Methods A randomized controlled trial, concealed allocation, blinded assessments, and intention-to-treat analysis will be carried out. Altogether, 34 individuals with PD (age ≥ 50 years old, with maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) <80cmH2O or maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) <90cmH2O) will be recruited. Patients will be randomly assigned to either (1) high-intensity respiratory muscle training (experimental group, 60% of MIP and MEP) or (2) sham training (control group, 0cmH2O). Individuals will perform a home-based intervention, with indirect home supervision, consisting of two daily 20-min sessions (morning and afternoon), seven times a week, during eight weeks. Primary outcomes are MIP and MEP. Secondary outcomes are inspiratory muscle endurance, peak cough flow, dyspnea, fatigue, exercise capacity, and quality of life. The effects of the training will be analyzed from the collected data using intention-to-treat. Between-group differences will be measured using a two-way ANOVA with repeated measures (2*3), considering baseline, post-intervention, and 12-week follow-up. Impact The results of this trial will provide valuable new information on the efficacy of high-intensity respiratory muscle training in improving muscle strength, functional outcomes, and quality of life in individuals with PD. Performing combined inspiratory and expiratory muscle training using a single equipment is cheaper and feasible, takes less time and is easy to use. In addition, this intervention will be carried out in the home environment that increases accessibility, reduces time, and costs of transport, which increases the feasibility to reproduce their findings in clinical practice. © 2023 Brito et al.

The aim of this study was to (1) get an insight into the variability of what is considered important to report in the surgical report following shoulder instability surgery and (2) determine which elements should be included in the surgical report following shoulder instability surgery according to Dutch surgeons using a Delphi method. Methods: Dutch orthopedic shoulder surgeons were included in a panel for a Delphi study consisting of 3 rounds. Importance of the elements was rated on a 9-point Likert scale. High variability was defined as an element that received at least 1 score between 1 and 3 and 1 score between 7 and 9 in round 3. Consensus was defined as ≥80% of the panel giving a score of 7 or more. Results: Seventeen shoulder specialists completed all 3 rounds and identified a total of 82 elements for the arthroscopic Bankart repair and 60 for the open Latarjet. High variability was observed in 57 (70%) and 52 (87%) of the elements, respectively. After round 3, the panel reached consensus on 27 and 11 elements that should be mentioned in the surgical report following arthroscopic Bankart repair and open Latarjet. Conclusion: There is high variability in what shoulder specialists regard essential to report. Consensus was reached on 27 and 11 elements to be reported following arthroscopic Bankart repair and open Latarjet, respectively. Future studies on an international scale can further improve data collection and communication between specialists. © 2023 The Author(s)",Consensus; Delphi; Delphi Approach; Instability; Shoulder; Standardized Reporting; Surgery; Surgical report; Survey Study,arthroscopic Bankart repair; article; consensus; Delphi study; human; Likert scale; shoulder stabilization surgery; surgeon,"""Shoulder Joint Health and Rehabilitation: Arthroscopic Surgeries, Treatments and Outcomes""",Clinical Outcomes and Treatments in Shoulder Care,Shoulder Surgery Outcomes and Measures

In this study, we investigated the effect of paroxetine, an SSRI, on thyroid hormone levels in rats. We also examined the role of irisin, a newly discovered potential regulatory hormone for metabolism, on paroxetine-induced changes. A total of 64 Sprague–Dawley female and male rats were randomly divided into four subgroups for each gender and treated as follows: sham-operated control (vehicle), paroxetine (treated with 20 mg/kg paroxetine by oral gavage), irisin (100 ng/kg/day for 28 days with mini-osmotic pumps), and paroxetine + irisin group (n = 8). Serum fasting free triiodothyronine (fT3) and free thyroxine (fT4) levels were measured by automated chemiluminescence method. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level was determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent analysis (ELISA). Compared to the sham control group (p < 0.05), the significantly reduced fT4 and TSH serum levels in paroxetine-treated male animals were markedly increased by subcutaneous irisin perfusion. fT3 levels significantly increased in both irisin (4.35 ± 0.17 pq/mL) and paroxetine + irisin groups (4.51 ± 0.19 pq/mL) compared to sham control (3.60 ± 0.23 pq/mL) and paroxetine groups (3.57 ± 0.12 pq/mL) (p < 0.05). It was observed that serum fT3, fT4, and TSH levels decreased in female animals receiving paroxetine compared to the sham control group. Subcutaneous administration of irisin increased these hormone levels. However, these changes were not statistically significant. These results suggested that irisin may play a role in the mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of exercise in preventing SSRI-related side effects by increasing thyroid hormone levels, which were decreased by paroxetine. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Irisin; Paroxetine; Thyroid-stimulating hormone; Thyroxin; Triiodothyronine,"Animals; Female; Fibronectins; Male; Paroxetine; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Thyroid Gland; Thyroid Hormones; Thyrotropin; Thyroxine; Triiodothyronine; irisin; liothyronine; paroxetine; thyroid hormone; thyrotropin; thyroxine; fibronectin; liothyronine; paroxetine; thyroid hormone; thyrotropin; thyroxine; animal experiment; Article; chemiluminescence immunoassay; controlled study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; exercise; fasting; female; free liothyronine index; free thyroxine index; hypothyroidism; liothyronine blood level; male; nonhuman; rat; sham procedure; thyrotropin blood level; thyroxine blood level; animal; metabolism; Sprague Dawley rat; thyroid gland","""Cognitive Decline Prevention and Improvement through Exercise and Therapeutic Interventions""",Exercise Interventions and Cognitive Function in Older Adults,Effects of Exercise and Supplementation on Performance and Health

Purpose: To identify which factors predicted return to work at any level and return to preinjury levels of work 6 months after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Multiple logistic regression analysis of prospectively collected descriptive, preinjury, preoperative, and intraoperative data from 1502 consecutive primary arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs, performed by a single surgeon, was performed to identify independent predictors of return to work at 6 months postoperatively. Results: Six months after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, 76% of patients had returned to work, and 40% had returned to preinjury levels of work. Return to work at 6 months was likely if patients were still working after their injuries but before surgery (Wald statistic [W] = 55, P <.0001), were stronger in internal rotation preoperatively (W = 8, P =.004), had full-thickness tears (W = 9, P =.002), and were female (W = 5, P =.030). Patients who continued working postinjury but presurgery were 1.6 times more likely to return to work at any level at 6 months compared to patients who were not working (P <.0001). Patients who had a less strenuous preinjury level of work (W = 173, P <.0001), worked at a mild to moderate level post injury but presurgery, had greater preoperative behind-the-back lift-off strength (W = 8, P =.004), and had less preoperative passive external rotation range of motion (W = 5, P =.034) were more likely to return to preinjury levels of work at 6 months postoperatively. Specifically, patients who worked at a mild to moderate level postinjury but presurgery were 2.5 times more likely to return to work than patients who were not working, or who were working strenuously postinjury but presurgery (p < 0.0001). Patients who nominated their preinjury level of work as “light” were 11 times more likely to return to preinjury levels of work at 6 months compared to those who nominated it as “strenuous” (P <.0001). Conclusion: Six months after rotator cuff repair, patients who continued to work after injury but presurgery were the most likely to return to work at any level, and patients who had less strenuous preinjury levels of work were the most likely to return to their preinjury levels of work. Greater preoperative subscapularis strength independently predicted return to work at any level and to preinjury levels. © 2023 The Author(s).",determinants; predictors; return to work; rotator cuff repair; rotator cuff tear,"Arthroscopy; Case-Control Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Range of Motion, Articular; Retrospective Studies; Return to Work; Rotator Cuff; Rotator Cuff Injuries; Treatment Outcome; arthroscopy; case control study; female; human; joint characteristics and functions; male; retrospective study; return to work; rotator cuff; rotator cuff injury; treatment outcome","""Shoulder Joint Health and Rehabilitation: Arthroscopic Surgeries, Treatments and Outcomes""",Clinical Outcomes and Treatments in Shoulder Care,Shoulder Surgery Outcomes and Measures

Knee pain in several studies have been seen to be more prevalent in active adolescents compared to inactive, although common in both groups. Nevertheless, few studies with large sample size have been published reporting the difference of the prevalence of knee pain for each sport among young sports players. This study investigated the point prevalence of knee pain among young sports players aged 6–15 years old according to age, sex, and sports discipline. Furthermore, this study investigated the association between knee pain and sports discipline among young sports players. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a self-reported questionnaire on young sports players aged 6–15 years from the Miyagi Amateur Sports Association. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the association between knee pain and sports discipline and were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), training days per week, and training hours per weekday and weekend. Results: A total of 7234 young sports players were included. The point prevalence of knee pain was 10.9%. Females (13.3%) had more knee pain than males (9.8%). Young, 13-year-old sports players had the highest prevalence of knee pain (19.1%). The multivariable analysis showed that the highest odds ratio [95% confidence interval] was observed for handball players (2.42 [1.01–5.81]). In addition, hand ball, mini-basketball (odds ratio 1.85; 95% CI 1.38–2.47), and basketball (odds ratio 1.66; 95% CI 1.23–2.26) were significantly associated with knee pain, compared with football. The lowest odds ratio was observed for swimming (0.34 [0.05–2.54]), followed by karate (odds ratio 0.38; 95% CI 0.16–0.89) and baseball (odds ratio 0.47; 95% CI 0.35–0.64). Conclusion: The prevalence of knee pain among young athletes differed according to age, sex, and sports discipline.

It is unclear whether accurate injections for capsulitis of the shoulder are more effective than inaccurate injections. OBJECTIVE: It has been hypothesized that a squishing sound following an intra-articular injection with a mixture of air and fluid means that the injection was accurately placed and that the efficacy of accurately placed injections is greater than that of inaccurate injections. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that a squishing sound following an injection predicts a better clinical result. METHODS: Files were selected of patients with capsulitis of the shoulder, who were treated with an intra-articular injection containing a mixture of triamcinolone, lidocaine, and air. After the injection, the shoulder was moved to determine whether a squishing sound could be produced. Efficacy was measured after two weeks according to the Patient Global Impression of Change scale. Differences in efficacy between injections with and without a squishing sound were expressed as an odds ratio. RESULTS: Sixty-one patients were selected. Squishing was heard after 47 injections (77%). Two weeks after the injection, a positive outcome was reported by 49 patients (80%). When squishing was heard, the effect was positive in 42 of the 47 patients (89%) and when no squishing was heard, the effect was positive in 7 of the 14 patients (50%). The odds ratio was 8.4 (95% CI 2.1–34.0; p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Efficacy of injections with a mixture of triamcinolone, lidocaine, and air for capsulitis of the shoulder is significantly greater when a squishing sound was heard after the injection. We hypothesize that squishing is related to accuracy and accuracy to efficacy. A future study with X-ray arthrography is needed to verify both hypotheses. © 2023 – The authors.

Method: Participants were 504 men aged 50–79 who were recruited using an online labor market. Participants completed a survey assessing demographics, medication history, concussion history, recent memory problems, and additional aspects of recent cognitive, mental, and physical health. Results: Men with a lifetime history of ≥3 concussions also reported a lifetime history of being prescribed medication for anxiety (46.8%), depression (43.5%), chronic pain (79.0%), and high blood pressure (66.1%). When asked about symptoms experienced over the past year and the past week, they endorsed higher rates of cognitive and mental health problems, migraines, and difficulties with sleep and fatigue. The multivariable logistic regression model for predicting mild or greater memory problems was significant, χ2(8) = 168.97, p <.001.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Eligible participants were recruited as part of a larger study. The 3D clavicular and scapular orientations were analyzed on the more painful side of the neck using a hierarchical cluster analysis. Clinical characteristics were neck pain location, intensity, duration, disability and presence of headache. Responses to scapular repositioning were classified as “yes and no”. Results: Fifty-eight participants (29 responsive; 29 non-responsive to scapular repositioning) participated in the study. Analysis identified two distinct subgroups: subgroup1 had greater clavicular retraction and scapular downward rotation (n = 26) and subgroup2 had greater clavicular elevation and scapular internal rotation and anterior tilt (n = 32). Headache and dominant pain in the upper neck were more frequent in subgroup 1 while dominant pain in the lower neck was frequent in subgroup 2 (p < 0.01). Most participants who responded positively to scapular repositioning (88.5%) were in subgroup1 and most non-responsive participants (81.2%) in subgroup2. Conclusions: The 3D clavicular and scapular orientations identified two subgroups of neck pain patients. Participants with predominantly downward scapular rotation were distinguished by pain in the upper neck, presence of headache and a positive response to scapular repositioning. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Clavicle; Cluster analysis; Neck pain; Posture; Scapula,Biomechanical Phenomena; Cross-Sectional Studies; Headache; Humans; Neck Pain; Scapula; biomechanics; cross-sectional study; headache; human; neck pain; physiology; scapula,"""Balance, Mobility, and Fall Risks in Aging and Musculoskeletal Conditions""",Impact and Control of Chronic Low Back Pain and Balance in Older Adults,Management and Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

However, there are fewer studies addressing the association between WHtR and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). Deriving an optimal WHtR would play an important role in promoting CRF in children and adolescents. Our aim was to analyze the association between WHtR and CRF and determine the optimal value of WHtR. Methods: In this study, 37,081 (19,125 boys, 51.6%) children and adolescents aged 7–18 years in five regions of China were tested for WHtR and 20-m shuttle run test (20 m SRT). One-way ANOVA was used to compare maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) among children and adolescents with different WHtRs and effect sizes were used to analyze differences between groups. Curvilinear regression was used to analyse the curvilinear relationship that exists between WHtR and VO2max. Results: In Chinese children and adolescents, the WHtR of boys was higher than that of girls by 0.01, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Overall, in the age groups of 7–9, 10–12, 13–15, and 16–18 years old, the differences in VO2max comparisons between different WHtR groups were statistically significant (P < 0.001). In Chinese children and adolescents in the age groups of 7–9, 10–12, 13–15, and 16–18 years old, VO2max levels were highest when the WHtR was 0.34, 0.32, 0.39, and 0.41, respectively. Conclusions: There is a curvilinear association between WHtR and CRF in Chinese children and adolescents. Both lower and higher WHtR led to a decrease in VO2max in children and adolescents. © The Author(s) 2024.",Associations; Cardiorespiratory Fitness; Children and adolescents; Cross-sectional analyses; Waist-to-height ratio,adolescent; adult; Article; cardiorespiratory fitness; child; China; Chinese; comparative study; cross-sectional study; female; fitness; groups by age; human; major clinical study; male; maximal oxygen uptake; preschool child; school child; waist to height ratio; young adult,"""Effects of Exercise and Lifestyle Modification on Diabetes, Obesity, and Cardiovascular Health""",Effects of Exercise Programs on Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Health Outcomes,Physical Fitness in Children and Adolescents

Methods: Patients were retrospectively identified using the International Classification of Diseases–10 codes for RCT pathology, and PROMIS outcomes were assessed at multiple visits between November 2017 and February 2020. Generalized linear mixed effects models were fitted with PROMIS sleep score as the predictor variable and other PROMIS scores as the response variable. Additionally, models were fit using a clinically significant dichotomization of PROMIS sleep scores to assess differences in average PROMIS scores. Results: The study cohort included 481 patients, 201 (41.8 ​%) of whom had disrupted sleep at first visit. A higher percentage of those with disrupted sleep at first visit were female, nonwhite, and not married compared to those with normal sleep. PROMIS scores at first visit differed by sleep category. Higher PROMIS sleep scores were associated with higher anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain intensity, and pain interference scores and lower physical function, social participation, and upper extremity scores. Relationships were similar when dichotomous PROMIS sleep scores were considered. Conclusion: There was a high prevalence of sleep dysfunction in patients with RCT. Sleep disturbance is associated with increased anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain intensity, pain interference and decreased physical function, social participation, and upper extremity function in patients with RCTs.

Orthopedic journals require a high follow-up percentage in prospective studies to ensure reproducibility, generalizability of the data, and to limit bias. This study's primary aim was to report the true follow-up rates after total shoulder arthroplasty among a multicenter cohort at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years and to explore various demographic factors associated with follow-up rates. Methods: A retrospective review of patients undergoing anatomic and reverse total shoulder arthroplasties at five U.S. centers from 2000 to 2020 was performed. The presence or absence of follow-up at 1-, 2-, 5-, and 10-year follow-up intervals was recorded as well as associated patient demographics and history variables. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were employed to examine the factors associated with patient follow-up. Results: 4700 shoulder arthroplasties were identified across five centers for review. Eligible follow-up rates were 66% at 1 year, 47% at 2 years, 26% at 5 years, and 9% at 10 years. When compared with the majority baseline groups at 1 year in multivariable analysis, the follow-up rate was significantly less for male patients (odds ratio [OR] = 0.83, P = .004), those over age 80 (OR = 0.66; P < .001), black patients (OR = 0.76, P = .035), Hispanic patients (OR = 0.54, P = .041), self-paying patients (OR = 0.5, P < .001), disabled patients (OR = 0.69, P = .021), those with psychiatric history (OR = 0.76, P < .001), and those with preoperative opioid use (OR = 0.81, P = .016). At 2 years, significantly lower follow-up rates were identified with patients ages 35 to 49.9 years (OR = 0.62, P = .013), over age 80 (OR = 0.67, P < .001), Hispanic (OR = 0.42, P = .010), unemployed (OR = 0.65, P = .014), psychiatric history (OR = 0.82, P = .017), and smoking history (OR = 0.71, P = .010). Conclusion: True clinical follow-up rates following shoulder arthroplasty are much lower than the 80% 2-year follow-up rate expected by most orthopedic journals. Many factors contribute to differences among follow-up rates. Promoting follow-up at all time points would limit bias in orthopedic literature and potentially allow for early intervention of complications, but would need to be balanced with the additional burden and resources needed from patients and providers. © 2023 American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons",Clinical follow-up; Level IV; Postoperative; Retrospective Case Series; Telehealth; Total shoulder arthroplasty,narcotic analgesic agent; adult; African American; aged; American Indian; anamnesis; anatomy; Article; Asian; body mass; Caucasian; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; controlled study; demographics; disabled person; female; follow up; Hispanic; human; major clinical study; male; medical history; mental disease; middle aged; osteoarthritis; preoperative period; retrospective study; reverse shoulder arthroplasty; rotator cuff rupture; rotator cuff tear arthropathy; shoulder arthroplasty; shoulder fracture; smoking; total shoulder arthroplasty; treatment failure; unemployment; young adult,"""Shoulder Joint Health and Rehabilitation: Arthroscopic Surgeries, Treatments and Outcomes""",Clinical Outcomes and Treatments in Shoulder Care,Shoulder Surgery Outcomes and Measures

The combination of an early practice (before growth peak) with high training loads could further increase the occurrence of musculoskeletal injuries. The aim of this study was to comparing the morphological and positional parameters of the acetabular and lower limbs of golfers with early or late involvement in the golf practice. Two populations: golfers with early involvement in golf practice (before adolescent growth peak, 12 y.o.), golfers with late involvement (after adolescent growth peak). Subjects underwent a low-dose biplanar radiograph in standard standing position allowing the 3D reconstruction of bones. Morphological parameters were automatically computed from it. Thirty-five male golf players were included: 13 in early group (mean age 27 y.o.), 22 in late group (mean age 56 y.o.). The index of cumulative torsions (sum of the tibial and femoral torsions) was different between sides in early: 7° on the lead-side; 20° on the trail-side (p < 0.01). This index was different between the lead-side of the early group compared to late (22°; p < 0.001). It could be explained by the mechanical stresses applied on lead knee and ankle during the follow-through. Intensive golf involvement by young players could lead to bone morphology modifications. © The Author(s) 2022.",Asymmetrical movement; bone morphology; femur; pelvis; tibia; torsion; training load,,"""Analysis of Biomechanics, Exercise Techniques, and Physiological Adaptations in Various Physical Activities""",Lower Limb Muscle Strength and Biomechanics Studies,Injury Risk and Performance in Athletes

Objectives: This study aimed to examine the knowledge about and attitude towards SRC among Jordanian sports coaches. Method: Our study was based on a cross-sectional survey. An Arabic version of the questionnaire from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was used to collect data. The survey identified participants’ demographics and knowledge about (0–10 points with higher scores indicating a higher knowledge) and attitude towards (8–40 with lower scores indicating favourable attitudes) SRC. Descriptive statistics and the Kruskal–Wallis test were used to examine knowledge and attitude differences by demographic factors. Spearman’s correlation examined the correlation between the total knowledge and attitude scores. Results: Participants included 193 coaches (62 basketball, 66 martial arts, 30 soccer, and 35 swimming). The median total knowledge and attitude scores were 4 and 30, respectively. The total knowledge score was the highest in martial arts coaches (median = 4) and those with graduate degrees (median = 5). The total attitude score was the lowest among basketball coaches (median = 28) and those who were 40–50 years old (median = 28). No significant correlation between knowledge and attitude scores was observed. Conclusion: Jordanian coaches have a deficiency in knowledge about SRC and hold attitudes that are not consistent with current practice recommendations. Clinical implications: Knowledge and attitude about SRC can be improved through education, access to healthcare providers, and adherence to SRC management guidelines. © 2024. The Authors.

There is limited data on other physical functioning domains in perinatally HIV-infected adolescents (PHIVA) thus the aim of this study was to establish the physical sequelae of perinatal HIV in adolescents. This South African cross-sectional study compared PHIVA with HIV-negative adolescents, assessing anthropometry, muscle strength, endurance and motor performance. All ethical considerations were adhered to. The study included 147 PHIVA and 102 HIV-negative adolescents, aged 10–16 years. The majority (87.1%) of PHIVA were virally suppressed however, they still showed significant deficits in height (p < 0.001), weight (p < 0.001) and BMI (p = 0.004). Both groups performed poorly in muscle strength and endurance but did not differ significantly. In motor performance, the PHIVA scored significantly lower for manual dexterity and balance, with significantly more PHIVA with motor difficulty. A regression analysis showed that viral suppression predicted muscle strength (p = 0.032) and age positively predicted endurance (p = 0.044) and negatively predicated aiming and catching (p = 0.009). In conclusion, PHIVA face growth deficits and challenges with motor performance, especially with manual dexterity and balance. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",adolescence; endurance; growth; HIV; muscle strength; physical functioning,Adolescent; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Progression; Exercise; Female; HIV; HIV Infections; Humans; Pregnancy; anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; adolescent; anthropometry; Article; body equilibrium; body height; body mass; body weight; CD4 lymphocyte count; CD4+ T lymphocyte; child; clinical study; controlled study; cross-sectional study; demographics; endurance; face growth; female; growth acceleration; health care access; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; major clinical study; male; motor performance; Movement Assessment Battery for Children; muscle strength; perinatal infection; physical activity; regression analysis; South African; virus load; disease exacerbation; exercise; Human immunodeficiency virus; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; pregnancy,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Physical Fitness in Children and Adolescents

Several psychological factors influence the return to sport after a sports injury. The traditional tools to assess the return to sport do not take into account psychological factors. The ankle ligament reconstruction-return to sport injury (ALR-RSI), validated for ankle instability, is a score to evaluate psychological readiness to return to sport. The goal of this study was to validate the ALR-RSI score for the assessment of the readiness to return to sport after Achilles tendon repair. Methods: The ALR-RSI score, adapted from the anterior cruciate ligament-return to sport injury (ACL-RSI) score used following knee ligament reconstruction, was validated according to the international COSMIN methodology. Patients operated for Achilles tendon repair responded to the questionnaire during the rehabilitation period. The EFAS, FAAM and VISA-A scores were used as reference questionnaires. Results: A total of 50 patients were included. The ALR-RSI score was strongly (r > 0.5) correlated to the EFAS score: r = 0.68 [0.50–0.80] the FAMM sport score: r = 0.7 [0.52–0.84] the FAAM AVQ score (r = 0.6 [0.35–0.78]), and the VISA-A score (r = 0.54 [0.26–0.76]). The discriminant validity was good with the ALR-RSI, which was significantly lower in the patients that did not return to sport: 60.7 (40–81.4) compared to those that did: 83.2 (64.3–100) p = 0.001. Reproducibility was excellent with an intra-class correlation coefficient ρ of 0.99 [097–1.00]. The internal consistency was excellent (alpha coefficient = 0.95).

METHODS: Design: Retrospective review. Setting: Level I trauma center. Patient Selection Criteria: Patients with a hip fracture treated with cephalomedullary nailing or hemiarthroplasty (CPT codes 27245 or 27236). Outcome Measures and Comparisons: Adherence to a protocol for FICB, time intervals between emergency department arrival, FICB, and surgery stratified by time of admission. RESULTS: Three hundred eighty patients were studied (average age 78 years, 70% female). Approximately 53.2% of patients received an FICB, which was less than a predefined acceptable adherence rate of 75% (P, 0.001). Approximately 5.0% received an FICB within 4 hours and 17.3% within 6 hours from admission. Admission during daylight hours (7AM–7pM) when compared with evening hours (7PM–7AM) was associated with improved timeliness ([8.3% vs. 0% within 4 hours, P, 0.001] [27.5% vs. 2.4% within 6 hours, P, 0.001]). Improved adherence to the protocol was observed over time (odds ratio: 1.0013, 95% confidence interval, 1.0001–1.0025, P = 0.0388). CONCLUSIONS: FICB implementation was poor but gradually improved over time. Few patients received an FICB promptly, especially during night hours. Overall, this study demonstrates that implementation of an FICB program at a Level I academic trauma center can be difficult; however, many hurdles can be overcome with institutional support and dedication of resources such as staff, space, and additional training.

Investigators continue to learn more about how faculty can assist students throughout recovery, yet we must also strive to determine whether such evidence is isolated or is in fact exhibited by faculty elsewhere. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine if successive faculty cohorts demonstrate similar perspectives and RTL decision-making profiles as those from initial investigations. METHODS: Two universities in New York State were recruited to participate in a two-stage cross-sectional study. College faculty with teaching responsibilities were given the opportunity to complete an online Qualtrics survey followed by a private interview discussing their thoughts, perspectives, and/or experiences with managing students with concussion. RESULTS: Accommodations for students were allowed more often when some form of documentation was present (disability services note = 100%; multiple types of proof = 91%; doctor/medical notes = 90%; and no note = 75%). Three factors consistently scored as influential to faculty RTL decision-making: documentation, teacher-student relationship, and empathy. No significant differences in scoring were seen between male and female faculty participants. Follow-up interviews revealed two themes: legitimacy and empathy. Legitimacy outlines why faculty seek verification of concussion prior to allowing accommodations and includes two subthemes: i) note/documentation, and ii) fairness/protecting integrity. Empathy discusses how and why faculty empathetically assist students with concussion, and includes two subthemes: i) personality, and ii) past experiences/understanding of concussion. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that faculty from different universities display similar RTL decision-making tendencies and perspectives towards students with concussion as those from initial investigations. These data allow RTL stakeholders to better understand and appreciate the potential for faculty to act as facilitators to concussion support. As gatekeepers of the classroom environment, understanding how to produce faculty cooperation will ensure a reproducible and positive outcome for students recovering from concussion. © 2023 - IOS Press.

We investigated the hierarchical relationship of multiple modifiable correlates favoring or diminishing cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness in youth. Design: Cross-sectional investigation. Methods: In a sample of 5174 children and adolescents, 31 correlates were hierarchized according to their impact on cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness assessed using the FITESCOLA® fitness battery. A Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection approach was employed and measures of correlation and association were used to investigate the relationship between physical fitness and correlates. Results: In children, body mass index was the most relevant factor to discriminate between high and low cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness of the upper, middle, and lower body. While body mass index was more important than any other correlate to differentiate levels of upper and lower body muscular fitness during adolescence, specific characteristics of sports participation emerged as key factors to discriminate between high and low cardiorespiratory fitness and middle body muscular fitness. Other correlates, including the self-report of active recess time, active commuting to school, favorable neighborhood conditions, and limited time on screens and cellphones, were demonstrative of favorable physical fitness levels. Conclusions: Both body composition and sports-related characteristics emerged as the two most relevant factors of physical fitness in youth. Additional health benefits may be obtained from building supportive environments for sports and healthy exercise habits within the household and at different school education levels. © 2024 The Authors",Cardiorespiratory fitness; Correlates; Decision tree analysis; Muscular fitness; Physical education and training; Youth,,"""Effects of Exercise and Lifestyle Modification on Diabetes, Obesity, and Cardiovascular Health""",Effects of Exercise Programs on Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Health Outcomes,Physical Fitness in Children and Adolescents

However, these types of pain management strategies have been shown to inhibit signalling pathways (e.g., cyclooxygenase-2) that may hinder muscular adaptations such as hypertrophy and strength. Nutraceuticals such as palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) have analgesic properties that act via different mechanisms to NSAIDS/analgesics. Furthermore, PEA has been shown to have a positive effect on sleep and may contribute positively to muscle hypertrophy via PKB activation. Although PEA has not been widely studied in the athletic or recreationally active population, it may provide an alternative solution for pain management if it is found not to interfere with, or enhance training adaptations. Therefore, the study aim is to investigate the effects of daily PEA supplementation (Levagen + ®) with resistance training on lean body mass, strength, power and physical performance and outcomes of recovery (e.g., sleep) compared to placebo. Methods: This double-blind, randomised controlled study will take place over an 11-week period (including 8-weeks of progressive resistance training). Participants for this study will be 18–35 years old, healthy active adults that are not resistance trained. Participants will attend a familiarisation (week 0), pre-testing (week 1) and final-testing (week 11). At the pre-testing and final-testing weeks, total lean body mass (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry; DXA), total mid-thigh cross sectional area (pQCT), maximal muscular strength (1 repetition maximum bench press, isometric mid-thigh pull) and power (countermovement jump and bench throw) will be assessed. Additionally, circulating inflammatory cytokines and anabolic hormones, sleep quality and quantity (ActiGraph), pain and subjective wellbeing (questionnaires) will also be examined. Discussion: This study is designed to investigate the effects that PEA may have on pre-to post intervention changes in total body and regional lean muscle mass, strength, power, sleep, subjective wellbeing, and pain associated with resistance training and menstruation compared with the placebo condition. Unlike other NSAIDs and analgesics, which may inhibit muscle protein synthesis and training adaptations, PEA which provides analgesia via alternative mechanisms may provide an alternative pain management solution. It is therefore important to determine if this analgesic compound interferes with or enhances training adaptations so that athletes and active individuals can make an informed decision on their pain management strategies.

The incidence of COVID-19 with social isolation and technological development in recent years strongly contributed to a progressive increase in obesity. Assess the pattern of the 3 divisions of physical activity and sedentary behaviors in obese patients. Physical inactivity is a significant concern, especially among individuals with obesity and certain demographic characteristics. Addressing these factors and promoting physical activity interventions tailored to specific populations is essential in combating sedentary behavior and its associated health implications.This case-control study included 350 adult obese patients (BMI ≥ 30) and 75 people with normal BMI (18.5-24.9). Their sociodemographic data were analyzed and their pattern of physical activity related to work, movement to and from places for 10 minutes, and pattern of recreational activity were assessed, in addition to the assessment of the sedentary behaviors. The mean age of the study group was 34 years, the majority were females, educated, and working. Forty five percent of the total sample were physically inactive; the pattern of activity during travel to and from places (10 min) was lower in obese patients. Recreational activities were low in the studied population, in the present study the time spent sitting or reclining (except sleeping) was significantly higher among obese participants than controls (P ≤.001).

Methods: Two randomized controlled trials were conducted. All patients were stable for more than 48 h and less than 1 week after revascularization for acute coronary syndrome and were randomly assigned to Group A (home-based rehabilitation group) or Group B (center guided home-based rehabilitation group). The cardiopulmonary exercise test was mainly performed before and 3 months after cardiac rehabilitation (at the end of intervention). The primary endpoints of the study were peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), and the secondary endpoints were maximum metabolic equivalents (METs), anaerobic threshold exercise load (Load AT), maximal workload (Load max), and anaerobic threshold oxygen uptake (VO2 AT). Results: A total of 106 patients were included in the study, with 47 patients in Group A (with 6 losses) and 50 patients in Group B (with 3 losses). There were no significant difference between the two groups in terms of age, gender, body mass index (BMI), left ventricular ejection fraction(LVEF), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol(LDL-C),cardiovascular risk factors. In Group A, no significant differences in CPET indices were observed before and after the intervention. In Group B, values of maximum metabolic equivalents (METs), peak heart rate (PHR), anaerobic threshold exercise load (Load AT), maximal workload (Load max), maximum ventilation per minute (VE max), peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), anaerobic threshold oxygen uptake (VO2 AT) and maximum oxygen pulse (VO2/HRmax) were higher than those before the intervention (P < 0.05). In addition, METs (max), Load AT, Load max, VO2 AT, and VO2peak in Group B were higher than those in group A (P < 0.05). The change rates of VO2peak, METs(max), PHR, Load max, VO2 AT, VE max, VO2/HR(max) in the two groups were significantly different before and after intervention (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Cardiac exercise rehabilitation is helpful for improving patients’ cardiopulmonary endurance and quality of life. Moreover, rehabilitation modalities with regular hospital guidance can improve cardiopulmonary function in a shorter period,which seems to be more effective than a complete home-based rehabilitation model.

Sedentary behaviour (SB) is an important risk factor for several health-related outcomes. The prevalence of SB is alarmingly high in older adults, who spend on average 9.4 h being sedentary each day, making them the most sedentary of all age groups. Objectives. The primary objective of this review is to assess the impact of interventions aimed at reducing SB in older adults (aged 60 years and older) living in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). The research question for this systematic review is as follows: in older people living in LTCFs, do interventions aimed at reducing SB, compared to usual care, result in a decrease in SB daily time or a reduction in the length of prolonged and uninterrupted sitting bouts? Data sources. Only peer-reviewed articles will be included in this systematic review, articles will be identified using the PICO method in seven different databases. Participants and interventions. Any primary intervention study (including randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, and cohort studies) with the aim to reduce SB daily time or shorten the length of prolonged and uninterrupted sitting bouts in older adults living in LTCFs will be included. After searching databases, abstracts of the studies will be screened, and, after retrieving full text articles, data extraction will be conducted by two independent reviewers. Study appraisal and synthesis methods. The review will adhere to PRISMA reporting guidelines. Risk of bias (RoB) will be assessed using ROBINS-I or the RoB 2.0 tool and will be discussed with a third reviewer. The data will be grouped according to study design, with separate analysis for randomised and non-randomised designs. Results. The primary outcomes will be SB or time spent sedentary, assessed before and after the intervention. For the outcomes with the same measurement units, the pooled mean differences will be calculated. Standardised mean differences will be calculated for the outcomes with different measurement units. The data not suitable in numbers will be synthesised narratively. The strength of evidence of the outcomes will be assessed using GRADE assessment. If the data are suitable for quantitative analysis, we plan to use the Revman software to conduct a meta-analysis. Conclusions and implications of key findings. This protocol can serve as a valuable resource for other researchers interested in conducting similar systematic reviews or meta-analyses in the field of SB and older adult health. © 2023 by the authors.",aged; cohort studies; risk factors; sitting position,,"""Physical Activity and Health Outcomes in Aging Populations""",Physical Activity and Health in Older Adults,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Place and Duration of Study: Orthopedic Department, Combined Military Hospital, Lahore Pakistan, from Jul 2020 to Jun 2021. Methodology: We included all the patients who underwent ipsilateral peroneus longus autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Fixation was achieved with a bio-absorbable screw on the tibial side and an endobutton on the femoral side. Lateral or medial menisectomy was performed according to the requirement. Post-op X-rays were done to assess the position of the endobutton and tibial tunnel. Eight millimetres tunnels were drilled, and the tendon was tailored accordingly. Results were assessed for pain, infection, range of motion and instability after three months of surgical procedure. Results: A total of 52 patients were included in the final analysis. The mean age of the study participants was 33.36±6.353 years. At the end of three months, pain 6(11.5%) and restricted range of motion 6(11.5%) were the common untoward outcomes reported by the patients. High body mass index and lack of engagement in physiotherapy had a statistically significant relationship with the presence of untoward outcomes in our study (p-value<0.05). Conclusion: Peroneus longus is a strong, robust autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with excellent functional results. Very few patients had untoward effects, and those, too, were of mild intensity. Patients with high body mass index and those not engaging in physiotherapy emerged as high-risk patients for having untoward effects after the surgery. © 2023, Army Medical College.

Epidemiological evidence shows that the incidence rate of CNLBP in young and middle-aged people who are demanded rapidly recovery and social contribution is rising. Recent guidelines indicate a reduced role for medicines in the management of CNLBP. Objective: The present study investigates the short-term effects of cupping and scraping therapy using a medicated balm, compared to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with a capsaicin plaster, in the treatment of CNLBP. Design, setting, participants and interventions: We designed a prospective multicenter randomized clinical trial enrolling patients from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022. A total of 156 patients with CNLBP were randomized into two parallel groups. Diclofenac sodium-sustained release tablets were administered orally to participants in the control group for one week while a capsaicin plaster was applied externally. Patients in the test group were treated with cupping and scraping using a medical device and medicated balm. Main outcome measures: Primary outcome was pain recorded using the visual analogue scale (VAS). Two secondary outcomes were recorded using the Japanese Orthopedic Association low-back pain scale (JOA) and the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome integral scale (TCMS) as assessment tools. Results: Between baseline and postintervention, all changes in outcome metric scales were statistically significant (P < 0.001). Compared to the control group, patients in the test group had a significantly greater treatment effect in all outcome variables, as indicated by lower VAS and TCMS scores and higher JOA scores, after the one-week intervention period (P < 0.001). Further, according to the findings of multivariate linear regression analysis, the participants’ pain (VAS score) was related to their marital status, age, smoking habits and body mass index. No adverse reactions were reported for any participants in this trial. Conclusion: The effectiveness of TCM combined with the new physiotherapy tool is superior to that of NSAID combined with topical plasters, regarding to pain intensity, TCM symptoms and quality of life. The TCM plus physiotherapy also showed more stable and long-lasting therapeutic effects. Trial registration: This study was registered at Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2200055655).

Deux types de chirurgie se distinguent aujourd'hui; les techniques de stimulation médullaire et les techniques de greffe ostéochondrale. La taille de la lésion orientant le geste chirurgical vers une stimulation médullaire a récemment été réévaluée à la baisse (< 1 cm). L'objectif principal de cette étude était donc d’évaluer la reprise du sport après chirurgie des LODT. Notre hypothèse est que la chirurgie des LODT permet la reprise des activités sportives dans la majorité des cas. Matériel et méthodes: Une étude prospective multicentrique a été menée dans dix centres français spécialisés en chirurgie du pied et de la cheville. Tous les patients âgés, de 18 à 65 ans, présentant une LODT symptomatique et résistante au traitement médical bien conduit d'au moins 6 mois justifiant une chirurgie, ont été inclus de juin 2018 à septembre 2019. Outre les données démographiques usuelles, la pratique du sport et le niveau (professionnel, compétition, loisir) étaient systématiquement recherchés en préopératoire. Un protocole commun de prise en charge chirurgical et de suites postopératoires avait été préalablement établi selon le stade arthroscannographique de la lésion. Les recommandations les plus récentes basées sur la taille, mais également la profondeur, ont été prises en compte. Le principal critère d’évaluation était la reprise du sport. Résultats: Une évaluation fonctionnelle finale avec le score American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) a été réalisée à 12 mois minimum. Résultats : sur 58 patients sportifs, 70,6% ont repris le sport (41/58) avec un délai moyen de 4,3 mois. Un score fonctionnel AOFAS important (p = 0,02) et une lésion de stade 1 (p = 0,006) étaient les seuls critères préopératoires significativement associés à une reprise du sport. Aucun autre facteur n’était prédictif d'une reprise de sport. Conclusion: Notre étude prospective permet de mettre en évidence que 70, 6 % des patients sportifs ont repris le sport après chirurgie d'une LODT selon un protocole chirurgical et des suites standardisées.

Methods: A randomized-controlled trial was conducted including patients scheduled to undergo arthroscopic meniscectomy for meniscal injury by 1 of 5 fellowship-trained sports medicine surgeons between September 2020 and October 2021. Patients were randomized to receive telerehab, defined as exercises and stretches provided by trained physical therapists over a synchronous face-to-face video visit or in-person rehabilitation for their postoperative course. International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC) score and satisfaction metrics were collected at baseline and 3 months postoperatively. Results: Analysis was conducted on 60 patients with 3-month follow-up outcomes. There were no significant differences in IKDC scores between groups at baseline (P = .211) and 3 months’ postoperatively (P = .065). Patients were more likely to report being satisfied with their rehabilitation group 73% vs. 100% (P = .044) if there were in the in-person group. Satisfaction differed significantly between the 2 groups at the end of their rehabilitation course, and only 64% of those in the telerehab group would elect to undergo telerehab again for future indications. Furthermore, they believed that future rehabilitation would benefit from a hybrid model. Conclusions: Telerehab showed no difference versus traditional in-person rehabilitation in terms of functional outcomes up to 3 months after arthroscopic meniscectomy. However, patients were less satisfied with telerehab.

Purpose: This study examined the relationship between exercise-induced muscle pain, symptom severity, and PA in 28 women with FM. Methods: Muscle pain rating (MPR) was assessed during 3 minutes of submaximal isometric handgrip exercise, whereas PA and symptom severity were evaluated via self-report questionnaires. The analysis examined the relationship between the variables, with the specific interest in the mediating role of PA in the relationship between exercise-induced muscle pain and symptom severity. Results: MPR was positively associated with symptom severity (b = 1.89; 95% CI = 0.01, 3.76; P = .048) and inversely associated with PA levels (b = −0.16; 95% CI = −0.30, −0.03; P = .021). PA levels were inversely associated with symptom severity (b = −7.94; 95% CI = −12.46, −3.42; P = .001). After statistically controlling for PA levels, the relationship between MPR and symptom severity was no longer significant (b = 0.60; Wald 95% CI = −1.05, 2.25; P = .474). Conclusion: Results show the link between the variables, and specifically demonstrate that PA mediates the relationship between exercise-induced muscle pain and symptom severity. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",fibromyalgia; muscle pain; pain processing; Physical activity; symptom management,Exercise; Female; Fibromyalgia; Hand Strength; Humans; Myalgia; Pain Measurement; complication; exercise; female; fibromyalgia; hand strength; human; myalgia; pain measurement; physiology; procedures,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Management and Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

However, evidence of the effectiveness of active physiotherapy on physical activity level in stroke survivors is scarce. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement, covering electronic searches from inception to March 16, 2022. Participants: Stroke survivors living in the community. Intervention: Any active physiotherapy, that is, involving exercises that require voluntary effort. Outcome measure: Objective and subjective physical activity level. RESULTS: Of 5590 identified references, 25 randomized controlled trials were eligible, and 21 had available data. The random-effects meta-analysis resulted in a small, significant effect size in favor of active physiotherapy measured using objective or subjective tools (21 studies, 1834 participants, standardized mean difference, 0.22 [95% CI, 0.04-0.40]; heterogeneity I2=65%), and a medium significant effect when objective tools were used (9 studies, 424 participants, standardized mean differences, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.03-0.92]; I2=73%). Meta-regression showed that 35% of the variance in trial outcome was explained by the measurement tool (objective or subjective) and 23% by age. None of the variances were associated with a specific dosage in terms of frequency, time, exercise duration, or the severity of the disability. CONCLUSIONS: Active physiotherapy seems to increase objective physical activity in community-dwelling stroke survivors. However, the evidence is of very low certainty.

The construct validity was assessed using reference instruments: the fatigue items of the Brunel Mood Scale (BRUMS) and the Short Recovery and Stress Scale (SRSS). A secondary aim was to explore the respondent interpretation of these 2 items using a concept identification approach. Methods: Two hundred forty-three (N = 243) dancers completed single-item fatigue and recovery (unipolar and bipolar), BRUMS, and SRSS once for construct validity. For reliability, 49 dancers completed the questionnaires twice, 1 week apart. Using a concept identification approach, 49 dancers were also asked comprehension and interpretation of fatigue and recovery. Results: The fatigue item correlated with SRSS stress items (rs = .37-.51) and BRUMs fatigue items (rs = .63-.66). The recovery item was only partially confirmed in terms of construct validity, when using the SRSS recovery items as reference (rs = .39-.43). Reliability was confirmed for the single items of fatigue (κ = .77-.78) and recovery (κ = .71-.78). Main responses for the concept of fatigue were tiredness (34.7%), muscle soreness (17.3%), and energy (13.0%). Main responses for the concept of recovery were muscle soreness (43.0%), tiredness (27.9%), and fatigue (24.0%). Conclusion: We provide preliminary confirmation of the validity and reliability of the single item fatigue in dancers. The recovery item was only partially confirmed in terms of construct validity, when using the SRSS recovery items as reference, but did display acceptable reliability and agreement.

Studies were selected and appraised using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tools. Data was extracted from the included studies and qualitatively synthesized. Results: Eleven studies were included in the synthesis. There was variability in the methods used to measure ANS function between studies, and sample populations and time to assessment following concussion varied considerably. There was also variability in the direction of change of ANS function between some studies. Conclusion: This systematic review identifies that concussion is associated with dysregulation of ANS function in pediatric athletes. We identified some weaknesses in the extant literature which may be due to existing logistical and financial barriers to implementing valid ANS measurements in clinical and sports settings. © JCCA 2023.

The limited range of motions reached could be due to iliofemoral ligament tightness, but no study has assessed capsular ligament strain during this test. The main objective of this study is to report strains within the iliofemoral ligament during the FABER test using a segmental approach. Methods: 9 hips were harvested, and all muscles were removed. Hemispherical markers (∅ 2.6 mm) were glued on the lateral and medial borders of both the medial and lateral iliofemoral bands, separating each border into proximal, mid, and distal portions. The lower limb was placed in a FABER test position. A laser scanner allowed to digitize the 3D surface of the capsule. A Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to assess the effect of ligaments, borders, and portions. Findings: The lateral band of the iliofemoral ligament showed greater strains (14.6 ± 11.4%) compared to the medial band (−8.7 ± 14.2%) (p < 0.001). The greatest strains were observed in the distal portion of the lateral border of the lateral band (51.1 ± 21.5%). A decrease in strain was observed in the mid-portion of the medial border of the medial iliofemoral ligament (−27.9 ± 8.9%). Interpretation: The FABER test is used to assess pain at the hip. Our results show that the limited range of motion at the hip during this test might be caused by increased strains in the lateral band. These results demonstrate that a limitation of joint range of motion during the FABER could be due to an excessive tension of the lateral band of the iliofemoral ligament. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Clinical assessment; FABER; Hip joint; Ligament strains,"Biomechanical Phenomena; Cadaver; Hip; Hip Joint; Humans; Ligaments, Articular; Range of Motion, Articular; Hip prostheses; Joints (anatomy); 3D surface; Clinical assessments; External rotation; Flexion-abduction-external-rotation; Hip joints; Laserscanners; Ligament strain; Lower limb; Range-of-motion; Rotations tests; abduction; Article; clinical assessment; controlled study; flexion abduction external rotation; hip pain; human; joint ligament; joint mobility; Kruskal Wallis test; lower limb; microcapsule; muscle; range of motion; rotation; tension; biomechanics; cadaver; hip; joint characteristics and functions; joint ligament; physiology; Strain","""Application of Machine Learning and Biomechanics in Musculoskeletal Health and Wearable Devices""","Knee Assessment and Recovery: Validity, Reliability, and Clinical Trials",Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the role of sensory information in these patients. Methods: Stabilogram-diffusion analysis was utilized to categorize the balance into local and central control modes based on the center of pressure (CoP) data acquired from quiet standing tests of 36 patients with T2DM and 20 healthy individuals. Local control was considered the efforts of muscles to stiffen the joints. Central control was the mode in which sensory information is used. Open- and closed-eye conditions were added to detect other sensory sources during the standing. Traditional linear measures of stability were also calculated for anterior–posterior and mediolateral directions. Results: Results showed that sway area, pathlength, and maximum velocity of the CoP are higher in the T2DM group (p < 0.001) in open-eye condition, but they did not change in eyes closed (p > 0.158). Both the local and central control mechanisms can cause postural instability in AP direction in patients with T2DM (p < 0.017). Contrarily, diabetes had no effect on the ML direction (p > 0.051). Patients with T2DM had a significant delay (about 225 ms greater than the controls) in the use of sensory information reflected in the AP direction outputs (p < 0.009). Conclusion: The patients with T2DM had poorer stability due to the delayed use of the sensory information. Diabetic postural stability was not fully provided in comparison with the healthy people even with using the sensory information. Elimination of the visual feedback led to reduced postural balance in these patients. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Research Society for Study of Diabetes in India 2023.",Diabetes mellitus; Peripheral neuropathy; Postural control; Sensory feedback; Stabilogram-diffusion analysis,adult; aged; Article; body equilibrium; clinical article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diabetic neuropathy; diabetic patient; eye; female; force; human; joint; male; muscle; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; observational study; pressure; rest; stabilography; standing; visual feedback; visual information,"""Balance, Mobility, and Fall Risks in Aging and Musculoskeletal Conditions""",Impact and Control of Chronic Low Back Pain and Balance in Older Adults,Evaluation and Improvement of Postural Balance and Muscle Strength

Objective: This study assessed the efficacy of the exercise regimen on various health metrics for elderly community dwellers. Methods: Forty-four participants were divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental group adhered to a 9-step core exercise regimen for fall prevention, practicing three times a week for 30 minutes across 10 weeks, while the control group maintained their regular daily activities without any specific exercise program. Before and after the intervention, participants underwent the timed up-and-go t est to evaluate the physical function, the berg balance scale (BBS) and one-legged stance test (OLST) for balance assessment, the activity-specific balance confidence scale for fall-related self-efficacy, and measures for health-related quality of life. Results: Participants in the experimental group showed significant improvements in physical function (p =.04, Cohen’s effect size (d) = 0.2). and balance ability on BBS (p <.01, d = 0.2) and OLST (p <.01, d = 1.3) compared to the control group.

Methods: Patients undergoing primary hip arthroscopy for FAIS from August 2021 to December 2022 were prospectively enrolled. Patients downloaded the iPhone app, rHip, at ∼6 months postoperatively, enabling retroactive access to Apple Health data. Gait metrics included step count, step length, and walking speed. Each patient's preoperative baseline was compared to that individual's successive postoperative week metrics. All patients underwent a standard 4-stage rehabilitation protocol. We compared metrics from beginning to end of each phase (i.e., week 1 to 6 for phase 1) and evaluated correlations with patient outcomes. Results: Fifty patients (40 women; age: 31.9 ± 14.5 years) were included. Patients had significantly reduced step count from postoperative weeks 1 to 5 and improved upon baseline at weeks 13 and 16 to 26. Patients had significantly reduced step length from postoperative weeks 1 to 4 and improved upon baseline at weeks 16 and 20. Patients had significantly lower walking speed from postoperative weeks 1 to 6 and improved upon baseline at week 20 (P < .05). Step count significantly improved over phase 1 rehabilitation (P < .05). Step length and walking speed significantly improved over each of phases 1 to 3 (P < .05 for all). Preoperatively, weak correlations were noted between step length and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) for Physical Function (PF)/Pain, as well as walking speed and Hip Outcome Score–Activities of Daily Living (HOS-ADL)/PROMIS-Pain. At 3 months, moderate correlations were noted between step count and HOS-ADL/12-item international Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-12), step length and HOS-ADL/PROMIS-PF, and walking speed and HOS-ADL/iHOT-12/PROMIS-PF/PROMIS-Pain. At 6 months, weak to moderate correlations were noted between all 3 gait metrics and HOS-ADL. Conclusions: A smartphone app was capable of capturing health data gait metrics. Patients undergoing hip arthroscopy for FAIS returned to baseline levels in step count, step length, and walking speed after phase 1 (6 weeks) of rehabilitation. The most consistent correlations between gait metrics and step count were seen at 3 months, although only weak to moderate. Gait metrics similarly had weak to moderate correlations with HOS-ADL at 6 months.

However, IF can decrease performance. This study aimed to investigate the effect of IF on total body mass (TBM) and Taekwondo performance. Nine athletes (seven male, two female; 18.4 ± 3.3 years) underwent 4 weeks of 12 h IF. TBM, countermovement jump (CMJ), mean kicks (MK), and total number of kicks (TNK) were compared weekly. Performance was measured in the fed state (FED) and fast state (FAST). Results showed decreased TBM in week 1 (62.20 ± 6.56 kg; p = 0.001) and week 2 (62.38 ± 6.83 kg; p = 0.022) compared to pre-intervention (63.58 ± 6.57 kg), stabilizing in week 3 (62.42 ± 6.12 kg), and no significant change in week 4 (63.36 ± 6.20 kg). CMJ performance in week 1 was lower in FED (35.26 ± 7.15 cm) than FAST (37.36 ± 6.77 cm; p = 0.003), but in week 3, FED (38.24 ± 6.45 cm) was higher than FAST (35.96 ± 5.05 cm; p = 0.047). No significant differences were found in MK and TNK in FSKTmult. RPE, KDI, and HR were similar between FED and FAST (p < 0.05). [LAC] was higher post-test compared to pre-test (p = 0.001), with higher concentrations in FED than FAST (p = 0.020). BG was higher in FED than FAST (p < 0.05) before physical tests.

This study aims to analyse the effect of rotation play training with HIIT Protocol on the anaerobic abilities of amateur futsal players. This research uses an experimental method with a two-group pre-test and post-test design. The sample in this study consisted of 30 amateur futsal players with an age of 19.23 ± 0.57 years, height of 165.60 ± 5.63 cm, body mass of 59.17 ± 5.24 kg, and BMI of 21.60 ± 1.93. Samples were divided randomly into an experimental group (EG) and a control group (CG). Data analysis used a Paired Sample T-test and an Independent T-test with a significance level of.05 and used Cohen’s ES to measure the magnitude of differences between groups. This study used the running anaerobic sprint test (RAST). The variables in RAST that will be analysed are Peak Power (W); Mean Power (W); Peak Power per Weight (W.kg-1); Mean Power per Weight (W.kg-1); Fatigue Index (%); Total effort time (s). The paired sample t-test resulted in a significant difference in EG with significance values of Peak Power p =.010, Mean Power p =.007, Peak Power per Weight p =.011, Mean Power per Weight p =.008, Fatigue Index p =.045, and total effort time p =.011, while in CG all variables do not have significant differences. The Independent T-test found that there was a significant difference between EG and CG with a significance value of p <.05. This research concludes that the rotation play training model with HIIT Protocol has a positive effect on the anaerobic endurance of amateur futsal players. © Faculty of Education.

It is unclear whether there are specific symptom clusters affecting protocol durations. Purpose: To describe the endorsement of specific concussion symptom clusters at GRTA protocol initiation and examine the association between symptom cluster endorsement and GRTA protocol duration. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: This study was conducted among cadets enrolled at 3 US service academies. Participants completed an evaluation upon GRTA protocol initiation. Participants endorsing symptoms were binarized based on 6 symptom clusters (cognitive, emotional, insomnia, physical, sensitivity, and ungrouped). The primary outcome of interest was GRTA protocol duration based on symptom cluster endorsement severity. Prevalence rates were calculated to describe symptom cluster endorsement. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were calculated for all 6 symptom clusters to estimate GRTA protocol duration while controlling for significant covariates. Results: Data from 961 concussed participants were analyzed. Of these, 636 participants were asymptomatic upon GRTA protocol initiation. Among the 325 symptomatic participants, the physical symptom cluster (80%) was most endorsed, followed by the cognitive (29%), insomnia (23%), ungrouped (19%), sensitivity (15%), and emotional (9%) clusters. Univariate results revealed a significant association between endorsing cognitive (hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; p =.001), physical (HR, 0.84; p <.001), insomnia (HR, 0.83; p =.013), sensitivity (HR, 0.70; p <.001), and ungrouped (HR, 0.75; p =.005) symptom clusters and GRTA protocol duration. Endorsing physical (HR, 0.84; p <.001) and sensitivity (HR, 0.81; p =.036) clusters maintained a significant association with GRTA protocol duration in the multivariable models. Conclusion: Participants endorsing physical or sensitivity symptom clusters displayed GRTA protocols prolonged by 16% to 19% compared with participants not endorsing that respective cluster after controlling for significant covariates. © 2023 The Author(s).",asymptomatic; concussion; military; recovery; symptom clusters,Athletic Injuries; Brain Concussion; Cognition; Cohort Studies; Humans; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Syndrome; United States; brain concussion; cognition; cohort analysis; complication; epidemiology; human; insomnia; sport injury; syndrome; United States,"""Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion: Studies on Impacts, Recovery, and Influences""",Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion Studies in Young Athletes,Post-Concussion Symptoms and Recovery in Adolescents

IMT has not been applied to fit child athletes, who are more likely to develop inspiratory muscle fatigue, and, consequently, to benefit from IMT. Methods: Thirty children (mean age: 10.7 ± 1.2 years) were recruited and randomly assigned to a high-intensity (HG), a low-intensity (LG), or a control group (CG). For both training groups, a double-blind procedure was applied. In the HG, 80% of maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) was used as the level of training intensity. The LG used 30% MIP. Training groups were trained at 6 breaths a set, 4 sets a day, totaling 24 breaths a day for 6 weeks. Exercise capacity outcomes include maximal and submaximal aerobic capacity, as measured as VO2max and distance from six-minute walk test (6MWD). Results show improvement in MIP, VO2max, and 6MWD only in the HG. MIP in the HG significantly increases from 108.7 (100.8–143.3) to 144.4 (130.0–175.6) cmH2O. VO2max in the HG increases from 43.0 (40.5–45) to 53.0 (46–63) mL·kg−1·min−1. The 6MWD increases from 792.0 (737.5–818.0) to 862.0 (798.5–953.5) m. Data are presented as median (interquartile range). No difference is found in the LG or CG. Conclusion: high-intensity IMT increases MIP, maximal, and submaximal exercise capacity in the HG, but no difference is found in the LG or CG. Therefore, high-intensity type of IMT improves aerobic fitness in fit children by appropriately applying inspiratory muscle strength training. © 2022 by the authors.",aerobic fitness; inspiratory muscle training; maximal inspiratory pressure; six-minute walk distance; VO<sub>2</sub>max,Breathing Exercises; Child; Exercise; Exercise Tolerance; Humans; Respiratory Muscles; Respiratory Therapy; child health; fitness; muscle; oxic conditions; public health; aerobic capacity; article; breathing; child; clinical article; controlled study; double blind procedure; exercise; female; human; male; maximal inspiratory pressure; muscle strength; muscle training; randomized controlled trial; school child; six minute walk test; breathing exercise; breathing muscle; exercise tolerance; physiology; procedures; respiratory care,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Physiological and Biomechanical Responses in Sports Performance

Physical activity can be assessed by self-reporting or objectively by accelerometery. Aim: To investigate the agreement between self-reported and objectively assessed physical activity among OHCA survivors. Hypothesis: Self-reported levels of physical activity will show moderate agreement with objectively assessed levels of physical activity. Method: Cross-sectional study including OHCA survivors in Sweden, Denmark, and the United Kingdom. Two questions about moderate and vigorous intensity physical activity during the last week were used as self-reports. Moderate and vigorous intensity physical activity were objectively assessed with accelerometers (ActiGraph GT3X-BT) worn upon the right hip for 7 consecutive days. Results: Forty-nine of 106 OHCA survivors answered the two questions for self-reporting and had 7 valid days of accelerometer assessment. More physically active days were registered by self-report compared with accelerometery for both moderate intensity (median 5 [3:7] vs. 3 [0:5] days; p < 0.001) and vigorous intensity (1 [0:3] vs. 0 [0:0] days; p < 0.001). Correlations between self-reported and accelerometer assessed physical activity were sufficient (moderate intensity: rs = 0.336, p = 0.018; vigorous intensity: rs = 0.375, p = 0.008), and agreements were fair and none to slight (moderate intensity: k = 0.269, p = 0.001; vigorous intensity: k = 0.148, p = 0.015). The categorization of self-reported versus objectively assessed physical activity showed that 26% versus 65% had a low level of physical activity.

Design: Retrospective chart review. Methods: Medical charts of collegiate athletes (n = 196 [70.9% female]) diagnosed with SRC were reviewed to extract: biological sex, dedicated AT exposure for their sport (yes/no), and time (days) to reaching clinical milestones (diagnosis, symptom resolution, unrestricted return to sport [RTS]). Mann–Whitney U tests were used to determine whether time to clinical milestones differed by sex, AT exposure, or their interaction. Proportions of same-day diagnoses and times to diagnosis, symptom resolution, and unrestricted RTS were evaluated with chi-squared and spearman’s rank correlations, respectively. Results: There were no significant differences in times to reaching any clinical milestone by sex, AT exposure, or their interaction (ps > 0.05). Forty-three percent of participants were diagnosed on the day of their SRC. This did not differ by sex or AT exposure (ps > 0.29). Longer times to SRC diagnosis were associated with more days to symptom resolution (ρ = 0.236, p = 0.001) and unrestricted RTS (ρ = 0.223, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Athlete sex and AT exposure were not associated with times to reach any clinical milestone; however, delayed diagnosis was associated with longer times to reach clinical recovery. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",gender differences; health iniquities; healthcare disparities; mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI); Sex differences; social determinants of health,,"""Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion: Studies on Impacts, Recovery, and Influences""",Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion Studies in Young Athletes,"Concussion in Sports: Detection, Effects, and Management"

Methods: Sixty-six upper extremities were included in the study. The distance between the tip of the GT and the distal tip of the lateral humeral epicondyle (LE) was evaluated as the humeral length (HL). The interval between the tip of the GT and the entry point of the coracobrachialis muscle by the MCN was measured. The distance between the proximal border of the tip of the CP and the distal portion of the medial humeral epicondyle (ME) and the entry point of the MCN into the coracobrachialis were evaluated. Proportions were used to project the entry point of the coracobrachialis by the MCN along the HL, respectively, the interval between the proximal border of the tip of the CP and the distal tip of the ME. Results: The entry point of the MCN into the coracobrachialis muscle can be expected at an interval between 14.9 and 33.9% of the HL (between the tip of the GT and the LE), starting from the tip of the GT. Regarding the reference line between the proximal border of the CP and the ME, the nerve’s entry point was located between 14.2 and 34.4%, starting from the CP.

One of the most important risk factors for sports-related injuries, especially non-collision injuries, is fatigue. It seems that poor proprioception may play an essential role to impose athletes to further injuries. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the effectiveness of fatigue on the repositioning sense of the lower extremity joints. Method: The electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar were systematically searched from inception to 11January 2024. The obtained records were exported to the EndNote Software version 8. Then, two investigators examined the records independently to find eligible studies based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria. In the case of disagreements, a consequence method was utilized. The quality of the eligible studies was evaluated using the Downs and Black checklist. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software ver. 3 software was used for statistical analysis. Q-test and I2 were employed to examine the data homogeneity. In addition, considering the risk of bias, the Funnel Plot and trim-and-fill method were used. Results: After reviewing the titles and abstracts of 3883 studies found in the selected databases, 43 articles were found to be eligible to include in meta-analyses. The results showed that fatigue led to a significant increase in the active absolute error of the knee (SDM = 0.524, 95% CI = 0.406–0.841), ankle in the horizontal plane (SDM = 0.541, 95% CI = 0.367–0.715), ankle in the sagittal plane (SDM = 0.443, 95% CI = 0.088–0.798), and hip (SDM = 0.988, 95% CI = 0.135–1.841). However, fatigue had no significant effects on the passive absolute error of the knee and ankle in horizontal plane and relative angular error of the knee. Conclusion: Fatigue can diminish the active joint position sense of the lower extremities and thus may increase the risk of injury by reducing proprioception. Therefore, future research could be conducted to investigate the potential impact of integrated fatigue-mitigating exercises into athletes’ training programs, with the aim of reducing the incidence of sports-related injuries. © The Author(s) 2024.",Fatigue; Knee; Proprioception; Sense of position,ankle joint; Article; athlete; body position; clinical effectiveness; data extraction; fatigue; hip joint; human; knee joint; lower limb; mean absolute error; Medline; meta analysis; photogrammetry; plyometrics; proprioception; quality control; risk factor; Scopus; search engine; systematic review; Web of Science,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Effects of Training Protocols on Injury Prevention and Performance in Soccer and Futsal Players

Thirteen participants (28.2 ± 5.7 years, 76.2 ± 9.6 kg, 178.2 ± 9.2 cm) performed the exercise under three velocity conditions and isometrically. Each condition involved three sets of exercise. Mean (Fmean) and peak (Fpeak) force values from both sensors were collected and compared.Suiff Pro exhibited excellent reliability for Fmean and Fpeak (ICCs = 0.99). When compared to the criterion measures, Suiff Pro showed trivial standardized bias for Fmean (Mean = 0.00 [CI 95% = 0.00 to 0.01]) and Fpeak (-0.02 [-0.04 to 0.00]). The standardized typical error was also trivial for Fmean (0.03 [0.02 to 0.03]) and Fpeak (0.07 [0.05 to 0.09]). Correlations with the MuscleLab force platform were nearly perfect: Fmean (0.97 [0.94 to 0.98]; p<0.001); Fpeak (0.96 [0.92 to 0.97]; p<0.001).The findings demonstrate that the Suiff Pro sensor is reliable and valid device for measuring force during isometric and dynamic resistance training exercises. Therefore, practitioners can confidently use this device to monitor kinematic variables of resistance training exercises and to obtain real-time augmented feedback during a training session.  © 2024 Illera-Domínguez et al.",,Biomechanical Phenomena; Exercise; Humans; Mobile Applications; Muscle Strength; Reproducibility of Results; Resistance Training; adult; Article; controlled study; correlation coefficient; female; ground reaction force; human; human experiment; isometric exercise; male; measurement accuracy; muscle strength; normal human; reliability; reproducibility; resistance training; training; validity; velocity; biomechanics; exercise; muscle strength; procedures; reproducibility; resistance training,"""Application of Machine Learning and Biomechanics in Musculoskeletal Health and Wearable Devices""","Knee Assessment and Recovery: Validity, Reliability, and Clinical Trials",Wearable Devices and Techniques in Gait Analysis and Mobility Rehabilitation

Methods: We conducted an individual participant harmonised meta-analysis of 12,095 adults (mean ± SD age 54.5±9.6 years; female participants 54.8%) from six cohorts with thigh-worn accelerometry data from the Prospective Physical Activity, Sitting and Sleep (ProPASS) Consortium. Associations of daily walking, stair climbing, running, standing and sitting time with a composite cardiometabolic health score (based on standardised z scores) and individual cardiometabolic markers (BMI, waist circumference, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, HbA1c and total cholesterol) were examined cross-sectionally using generalised linear modelling and cubic splines. Results: We observed more favourable composite cardiometabolic health (i.e. z score <0) with approximately 64 min/day walking (z score [95% CI] −0.14 [−0.25, −0.02]) and 5 min/day stair climbing (−0.14 [−0.24, −0.03]). We observed an equivalent magnitude of association at 2.6 h/day standing. Any amount of running was associated with better composite cardiometabolic health. We did not observe an upper limit to the magnitude of the dose–response associations for any activity type or standing. There was an inverse dose–response association between sitting time and composite cardiometabolic health that became markedly less favourable when daily durations exceeded 12.1 h/day. Associations for sitting time were no longer significant after excluding participants with prevalent CVD or medication use. The dose–response pattern was generally consistent between activity and posture types and individual cardiometabolic health markers. Conclusions/interpretation: In this first activity type-specific analysis of device-based physical activity, ~64 min/day of walking and ~5.0 min/day of stair climbing were associated with a favourable cardiometabolic risk profile. The deleterious associations of sitting time were fully attenuated after exclusion of participants with prevalent CVD and medication use. Our findings on cardiometabolic health and durations of different activities of daily living and posture may guide future interventions involving lifestyle modification.

However, these forces are usually measured indirectly with non-interpretable “black box” models. Here we report an interpretable model with a function approximation algorithm. The model uses time series of plantar pressure from instrumented insoles to estimate vertical ground reaction forces. The study included data from 16 persons moving at different speeds on a two-belt treadmill equipped with force plates. The introduced regression model, based on a high-dimensional approximation, using only low-dimensional variable interactions, demonstrated its ability to estimate vertical ground reaction forces. The normalized mean square error for velocities between 3 and 9kmh-1 ranged from 10.6 to 24.4% . The accuracy of the presented approach, which can be used to analyze and interpret the learned model, was comparable to that reported in the literature. Furthermore, the evaluation of the learned model is particularly suitable for embedded and portable systems and, after a one-time calibration measurement, allows permanent and laboratory-independent measurement of vertical ground reaction forces. © 2024, The Author(s).",ANOVA decomposition; Biomechanics; Bipedal locomotion; Gait analysis; Ground reaction force; Instrumented insole; Instrumented treadmill; Prediction model; Running; Wavelets; Wearable technology,Approximation algorithms; Embedded systems; Gait analysis; Mean square error; Regression analysis; Sporting goods; ANOVA decomposition; Bipedal-locomotion; Ground reaction forces; High-dimensional; Instrumented insole; Instrumented treadmill; Plantar pressures; Prediction modelling; Running; Wavelet; Wearable technology,"""Application of Machine Learning and Biomechanics in Musculoskeletal Health and Wearable Devices""","Knee Assessment and Recovery: Validity, Reliability, and Clinical Trials",Wearable Devices and Techniques in Gait Analysis and Mobility Rehabilitation

While non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are often used to treat pain in osteoarthritis, they are not a suitable long-term solution because of their associated adverse events. Slow-acting symptom-modifying or structure/disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs have demonstrated safety with minimal side effects, but their efficacy remains controversial. We hypothesize that differences in physical activity patterns among patients with knee or hip osteoarthritis could partly explain the large heterogeneity in response to oral glucosamine/chondroitin. Our hypothesis suggests that stagnant synovial fluid may restrict the diffusion of these drugs into the joint cartilage cells, leading to variable clinical outcomes. In this study, we provide evidence to support this hypothesis and propose a simple post-intake physical therapy procedure to enhance the effectiveness of chondroprotective agents. If validated, this approach could be a valuable addition to non-operative osteoarthritis management, potentially resulting in remarkable improvements in patient outcomes. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Cartilage drug delivery; Glucosamine/chondroitin sulfate; Knee/hip osteoarthritis; Physical activity; Sedentary behaviour; Unstirred diffusion barrier,chondroitin sulfate; chondroprotective agent; glucosamine; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; paracetamol; Article; articular cartilage; chondroprotection; clinical effectiveness; diffusion; disease severity; drug delivery system; drug efficacy; drug formulation; drug safety; hip osteoarthritis; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; isometric exercise; knee osteoarthritis; muscle strength; nonhuman; osteoarthritis; outcome assessment; physical activity; physiotherapy; prediction; resistance training; sedentary lifestyle; stretching exercise; synovial fluid; treatment outcome,Advancements in Therapies and Technologies for Osteoarthritis and Joint Disorders,Therapeutic Interventions and Their Efficacy in Osteoarthritis Treatment,Efficacy and Safety of Different Treatments for Osteoarthritis

However, the use of ANNs to match sport initiation (SI) standards and to assist during the selection and mentoring of young sports talent has not yet been tested. Objective: To use artificial multilayer neural networks (MLPs) to perform a combination of the morphological and neuromuscular patterns of SI youth with those of young athletes. Methods: 75 young men (13.3 ± 1.65-years), 87% of whom were athletes from different sports (volleyball, rowing, soccer, tennis, Brazilian-jiu-jitsu (BJJ), swimming) and 13% were SI practitioners were included. Their morphology was verified by anthropometry and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Neuromuscular performance was verified by neuromotor tests (handgrip, vertical jump, countermovement, and medicine-ball throw). MLPs were programmed to verify the percentage of similarity between the morphological and neuromuscular patterns of youngsters in SI with those of young athletes of different sports. Results: SI indicated similarity with the morphological patterns of 90% with tennis, 87% with soccer, 80% with swimming and 79% with BJJ. SI indicated similarity with neuromuscular patterns of 87% with soccer, 81% with swimming and 75% with BJJ. When combining the morphological and neuromuscular patterns SI showed similarity of 88% with soccer, 79% with swimming, 77% with BJJ and 70% with tennis. For rowing, there were no significant similarities. Conclusion: It was possible to conclude that using MLPs is a strategy that helps direct young people from SI to a specific sport. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag Italia S.r.l., part of Springer Nature.",Athletes; Neural network; Performance; Puberty; Sport,,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

One component of this is a shift in our skeletal muscle biology towards a predominance of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) I isoforms (i.e. slow fibers) across our pelvis and lower limbs, which distinguishes us from chimpanzees. Here, new MyHC data from 35 pelvis and hind limb muscles of a Western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) are presented. These data are combined with a similar chimpanzee dataset to assess the MyHC I content of humans in comparison to African apes (chimpanzees and gorillas) and other terrestrial mammals. The responsiveness of human skeletal muscle to behavioral interventions is also compared to the human-African ape differential. Humans are distinct from African apes and among a small group of terrestrial mammals whose pelvis and lower limb muscle is slow fiber dominant, on average. Behavioral interventions, including immobilization, bed rest, spaceflight and exercise, can induce modest decreases and increases in human MyHC I content (i.e. -9.3% to 2.3%, n = 2033 subjects), but these shifts are much smaller than the mean human-African ape differential (i.e. 31%). Taken together, these results indicate muscle fiber content is likely an evolvable trait under selection in the hominin lineage. As such, we highlight potential targets of selection in the genome (e.g. regions that regulate MyHC content) that may play an important role in hominin skeletal muscle evolution. © 2023",Chimpanzee; Enhancers; Fiber type; Gorilla; Hind limb; Lower limb; Myosin heavy chain I,"Animals; Hominidae; Humans; Mammals; Muscle Fibers, Skeletal; Muscle, Skeletal; Myosin Heavy Chains; Pan troglodytes; Protein Isoforms; myosin heavy chain; myosin heavy chain I; unclassified drug; isoprotein; myosin heavy chain; adult; animal cell; animal tissue; Article; bed rest; chimpanzee; controlled study; evolution; exercise; female; fossil hominin; genome; Gorilla gorilla; hindlimb muscle; human; immobilization; muscle cell; nonhuman; pelvic muscle; protein content; skeletal muscle; space flight; terrestrial species; animal; genetics; hominid; mammal; Pan troglodytes; skeletal muscle; skeletal muscle cell","""Effects of Different Factors on Muscle Performance and Metabolism""",Exercise and Muscle Performance in Different Individuals,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

We sought to determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a multi-component physical literacy program for children with neurodevelopmental, emotional, or behavioural challenges. Thirty children and 28 parents were recruited to participate in the 10-week single-group non-randomised feasibility trial. Thriving Families was designed to promote children's physical literacy through (a) providing programmed opportunities for PA, (b) incorporating parents, (c) supporting motivation and engagement, and (d) utilising behaviour change techniques. Program feasibility was determined using qualitative and quantitative feedback. Preliminary efficacy was determined through pre-and post-intervention assessments of children's physical literacy. Results indicate that the program is acceptable and was well received. Effect size estimates for parent knowledge (d = 0.78) and confidence (d = 0.57) were moderate to large; however, little change was observed for parents' motivation to support PA and children's perceptions of PA support. Moderate or large effects were observed for pre-to-post-program change on children's domains of physical competence. The Thriving Families program appears to be feasible and acceptable for community-based implementation and may provide benefits for physical and psychological outcomes. © 2023 The Authors",Behaviour change; Exercise; Fitness; Motivation; Parents; Physical activity,adult; Article; behavior change; body height; body mass; body weight; child; Child Behavior Checklist; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; demographics; descriptive research; emotional disorder; externalizing disorder; feedback system; female; health literacy; human; internalizing disorder; knowledge; male; mental disease; motivation; muscle strength; parenting education; patient autonomy; physical activity; problem behavior; program feasibility; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; questionnaire; social interaction; thematic analysis; workshop,"""Physical Activity Interventions and Motor Competence in Children with Disabilities""",Motor Skills Development and Intervention in Children with Disabilities,Physical Fitness in Children and Adolescents

Thus, reliable, valid, and easily applied measurement tools are needed to quantify trunk muscle strength and monitor changes in response to interventions. Objectives: To determine within-day and between-day test re-test reliability and criterion validity of a handheld dynamometer (HHD) to evaluate maximum isometric trunk strength in people with chronic LBP and asymptomatic individuals. Design: Reliability and criterion validity study. Methods: Twenty adult participants with chronic, non-specific LBP and 35 asymptomatic individuals participated. Isometric trunk flexion, extension, and rotation strength were evaluated with the HHD (Active force 2) and the within-day and between-day reliability were determined with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC2,1) and the standard error of the measurements (SEM), minimal detectable change (MDC), and the limits of agreement (LOA) using Bland-Altman plots. Criterion validity was evaluated using Pearson correlation coefficients to compare HHD measurements to isokinetic dynamometry for both isometric trunk flexion and extension strength. Results: Good to excellent within-day and between-day reliability was observed for people with LBP and asymptomatic individuals with (ICC2,1) of 0.73–0.93 and 0.62–0.92 respectively. A moderate to strong correlation was found between measurements with the HHD and the isokinetic dynamometer with a correlation of r = 0.68–0.78 and r = 0.56–0.59 for people with LBP and asymptomatic participants respectively. Conclusion: A HHD is a reliable, valid, and clinically applicable tool for the measurement of trunk strength in adults with and without chronic LBP. © 2023 The Authors",Handheld dynamometer; Low back pain; Psychometric properties; Trunk muscle strength,Adult; Humans; Isometric Contraction; Low Back Pain; Muscle Strength; Muscle Strength Dynamometer; Reproducibility of Results; adult; ankle brachial index; Article; backache; body mass; clinical article; correlation coefficient; criterion related validity; dynamometry; exercise; female; goniometry; human; impedance; interrater reliability; lifestyle modification; limit of agreement; low back pain; male; measurement repeatability; minimum detectable change; muscle strength; muscle training; numeric rating scale; Oswestry Disability Index; pain intensity; questionnaire; range of motion; reliability; resistance training; Short Form 36; skeletal muscle; test retest reliability; validity; low back pain; muscle isometric contraction; muscle strength; physiology; reproducibility,"""Balance, Mobility, and Fall Risks in Aging and Musculoskeletal Conditions""",Impact and Control of Chronic Low Back Pain and Balance in Older Adults,Evaluation and Improvement of Postural Balance and Muscle Strength

However, validation to date has been limited to single-leg configurations, discrete flexion angles, and in vitro (phantom-based) experiments. In this work, we take a major step forward to explore the bilateral monitoring of knee flexion angles, in a continuous manner, in vivo. The manuscript provides the theoretical framework of bilateral sensor operation and reports a detailed error analysis that has not been previously reported for wearable loop sensors. This includes the flatness of calibration curves that limits resolution at small angles (such as during walking) as well as the presence of motional electromotive force (EMF) noise at high angular velocities (such as during running). A novel fabrication method for flexible and mechanically robust loops is also introduced. Electromagnetic simulations and phantom-based experimental studies optimize the setup and evaluate feasibility. Proof-of-concept in vivo validation is then conducted for a human subject performing three activities (walking, brisk walking, and running), each lasting 30 s and repeated three times. The results demonstrate a promising root mean square error (RMSE) of less than 3° in most cases. © 2024 by the authors.",bioelectromagnetic; e-textiles; electromotive force; Faraday’s law; joint flexion; wearable sensor,"Biomechanical Phenomena; Humans; Knee Joint; Motion; Range of Motion, Articular; Walking; Wearable Electronic Devices; Electromagnetic simulation; Electromotive force; Mean square error; Phantoms; Physiological models; Bio-electromagnetics; E-textile; Faraday’s law; In-vitro; In-vivo; Joint flexion; Knee flexions; Loop sensors; Phantoms; State of the art; biomechanics; human; knee; motion; range of motion; walking; Wearable sensors","""Application of Machine Learning and Biomechanics in Musculoskeletal Health and Wearable Devices""","Knee Assessment and Recovery: Validity, Reliability, and Clinical Trials",Wearable Devices and Techniques in Gait Analysis and Mobility Rehabilitation

However, the role of these variables is not well documented in teams with intellectual impairments (II). This study aimed to explore ball possession and game rhythm differences between II and non-II basketball games. Methods: Data were obtained through video observations (53 II games) and the International Basketball Federation records (53 non-II games). Results: Independent t-tests (P ≤ 0.05) revealed that the number of ball possessions was higher and game rhythm was faster in II games. Two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (P ≤ 0.05) showed that ball possessions and game rhythm developed differently throughout the II games compared with the non-II games. Conclusions: The differences may be due to the decision-making, tactical and self-regulatory limitations of players with II. These limitations adequately explain why players with II respond differently to the environmental cues and monitor insufficiently their actions compared with players without II. Additionally, the higher number of ball possessions and the faster game rhythm in II games could be an indicator of more intuitive, and thus faster, game-related decision-making. In conclusion, the study provides further understanding of the role of cognition in basketball and contributes to better explain the differences between II and non-II games. © 2023 The Authors.

Methods: A web-based online survey was conducted among students in Poland and Portugal (398 respondents—229 from Poland and 169 from Portugal) aged between 17 and 26 in October 2022. The level of depression was assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) in Polish and in Portuguese. The level of physical activity was measured by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) in Polish and in Portuguese. Results: Overall, 20–35% of respondents suffered from moderate depression, with a lower proportion among men. There were no differences in the percentage distribution of depression classification between Polish and Portuguese students. A decrease in the severity of depression was observed with increasing physical activity. In both countries, walking more often had the strongest effect on reducing depression scores. Conclusions: The continued and alarming prevalence of depressive disorders among university students in the year after the pandemic began had a significant impact on this population—further research on the impact of physical activity on mental health in different populations should be conducted to adjust the optimal level of physical activity for alleviating negative psychiatric symptoms. © 2023 by the authors.",COVID-19; depression; physical activity; Poland; Portugal; students,adolescent; adult; Article; Beck Depression Inventory; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; depression; depression assessment; disease association; disease severity; female; health survey; human; international physical activity questionnaire; major clinical study; male; mental disease; mental health; pandemic; physical activity; pilot study; Poland; population research; Portugal; Portuguese (citizen); prevalence; social media; university student; virtual learning environment; walking,"""Impacts of COVID-19 on Physical and Mental Health, Exercise Habits, and Rehabilitation Strategies""","Impact of COVID-19 on Health, Physical Activity and Quality of Life",Mental Health and Physical Activity in Times of COVID-19

However, the strategy adopted can influence match-running performance. This study aimed to verify the relationship between the key indicators of offensive performance and match running performance in FIFA Women´s World Cup 2023 (2023-WC). Thirteen key offensive performance indicators were collected from 64 matches (from 32 national teams) with a multi-camera optical tracking system (TRACAB Gen5, ChyronHego). Possession, line breaks completed, receptions in the final third and ball progressions were negatively related to distance covered. On the other hand, goals, total passes, and defensive line breaks were positively associated. K-means cluster analysis indicates that the team that outperformed the above variables was the one that was successful in the 2023-WC. Therefore, the superior performance of some variables, such as ball possession and progression, may prevent athletes from covering greater distances. Teams that make larger pass exchanges and make more breaks in defensive lines may be asked to run more. There are specific key offensive indicators that are related to match running performance. This information can be useful for coaches in choosing the strategy adopted. © 2024 The Author(s).

Studies found that about 50% of patients with a recent SCI are affected by malnutrition when they enter a rehabilitation institution. However, there is a lack of data during the course and at discharge of initial rehabilitation as well as missing knowledge about the factors promoting such a risk. The aim of this study was to assess the risk of malnutrition in individuals with SCI 3 months post injury and at the end of inpatient rehabilitation and to identify factors associated with a high risk of malnutrition. Methods: Retrospective, monocentric, longitudinal cohort study, using the data set of the Swiss Spinal Cord Injury Cohort Study and additional data from the patients’ medical records. Individuals with SCI were assessed for the risk of malnutrition using the Spinal Nutrition Screening Tool 3 months post injury and at discharge from initial inpatient rehabilitation. Odds ratios (OR) for potential risk parameters were calculated. Results: Of the 252 participants included, 62% were at risk for malnutrition 3 months post injury and 40% at discharge (p = 0.000). Moderate to high risk of malnutrition was found regardless of age and BMI. The highest odds for an increased risk at 3 months post injury was identified in ventilator-dependent persons (OR 10.2). At discharge from inpatient rehabilitation, pressure injury (OR 16.3) was the most prominent risk factor. Conclusion: In the population with SCI the risk of malnutrition is widespread during inpatient rehabilitation, but also at discharge. Ventilated persons and persons with pressure injuries are clear risk groups and need special attention. Based on these findings and the known negative impact of malnutrition on clinical outcomes, the awareness of malnutrition should be increased in the population with SCI. Therefore, a regular and standardized screening of the malnutrition risk is highly recommended.

Background: We previously established a well-tolerated preoperative exercise program after finding a high frequency of sarcopenia and frailty in patients with pancreatic cancer. Methods: In this randomized, controlled trial (NCT03187951), patients with pancreatic cancer were randomized to Arm A: enhanced usual care or Arm B: prescribed aerobic and resistance exercise during neoadjuvant therapy. Patients received nutrition counseling and activity trackers. The primary endpoint was a 6-minute walk distance (6MWD; ≥14 meters improvement was clinically meaningful). Secondary endpoints included additional physical function tests, health-related quality of life, and clinical outcomes. Results: One hundred fifty-one patients were randomized. Objectively measured weekly activity (153.2±135.6 and 159.8±122.8 min in Arm A and B, respectively, P=0.62) and self-reported weekly moderate-to-strenuous physical activity (107.4±160.4 and 129.6±161.6 min in Arm A and Arm B, respectively, P=0.49) were similar, but weekly strength training sessions increased more in Arm B (by 1.8±1.8 vs 0.1±2.4 sessions, P<0.001). 6MWD improved in both Arm A (mean change 18.6±56.8 m, P=0.01) and Arm B (27.3±68.1 m, P=0.002). Quality of life and clinical outcomes did not significantly differ between arms. Pooling patients in both study groups, exercise, and physical activity was favorably associated with physical performance and clinical outcomes. Conclusions: In this randomized trial of prescribed exercise versus enhanced usual care during neoadjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer, a high volume of physical activity and increased exercise capacity were observed in both arms, highlighting the importance of activity among patients preparing for surgery.

Given the lack of level I evidence favoring a specific CMN length to prevent adverse surgical outcomes, we investigated if CMN length impacts acute postoperative pain and opioid use. The authors hypothesize that the use of longer CMNs results in increased pain scores and morphine milligram equivalents (MME) intake during the 0–24 h (h) and 24–36 h postoperative period. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed from 2010 to 2020 of patients ≥ 65 years-old who underwent CMN for IT fractures and fractures with subtrochanteric extension (STE). We compared patients who received short and long CMNs using numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scores and MME intake at 0–24 h and 24–36 h postoperatively. Results: 330 patients receiving short (n = 155) and long (n = 175) CMNs met criteria. CMN length was found to not be associated with higher pain scores in the early postoperative phase. However, patients with long CMNs received higher MME from 0–24 h (25.4% estimated mean increase, p value = 0.02) and 24–36 h (22.3% estimated mean increase, p value = 0.04) postoperatively, even after adjusting for covariates, gender, and age. Conclusion: Patients with long CMNs received greater MME postoperatively. Additionally, differences in pain and MME were not significantly different between patients with and without STE, suggesting our findings were not influenced by this pattern. These results suggest longer CMNs are associated with higher acute postoperative opioid intake among patients with IT fractures.

This study aims to determine the potential of plyometric training to improve leg muscle explosiveness and athlete performance in swimming. Pre and post control groups were employed in this experimental investigation. Purposive sampling was used to choose the research volunteers, after which they were split into two groups. namely G1 which only followed swimming training without being given a land training program or plyometrics, and G2 was given plyometric training treatment. The research subjects were 30 male athletes aged 18-19 years who were active in participating in training camps. There was plyometric training for eighteen meetings, four times a week. The individual completed the vertical jump test to collect pre-test data prior to receiving therapy. In this study's statistical analysis, the descriptive tests were used to determine the mean, standard deviation, and standard error using IBM SPSS version 26. Additionally, the Shapiro-Wilk method was used to test the normality of the data; if the results were normal, the paired t-test was used for the subsequent test. In comparison to the group that did not get the plyometric training treatment, the results indicated a substantial increase (p<0.05) in the leg muscular explosive power among the participants who received the plyometric training approach. For swimmers who want to increase their performance in the water, plyometric training is essential since it offers several key advantages. For swimmers, the major objective of plyometric training is to improve muscular strength and explosiveness, particularly in the lower body parts like the legs and pelvis. © JPES.",leg muscle explosive power; Plyometric; Swimming; untrained,,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Effects of different training methods on athletic performance and injury prevention

Cognitive change can be statistically examined using standardized regression-based (SRB) formulas, which yield a z-score indicating amount of change compared to a normative group. Objective: To use SRB z-scores to quantify cognitive change in a sample of patients classified as MCI at baseline, and to compare cognitive change in those who remained MCI on follow-up (MCI-Stable) and those who progressed to dementia (MCI-Decline). Methods: Using 283 MCI patients from a cognitive disorders clinic who were re-assessed after approximately one- and one-half years, SRB z-scores were calculated for each test in a comprehensive neuropsychological battery for each participant. Results: There was a significant decline between timepoints across all cognitive tests, with the greatest amount of decline on tests of learning and memory. Group differences were seen on nearly all cognitive tests, with the MCI-Decline group showing more decline (i.e., significantly larger and negative z-scores) than the MCI-Stable participants. Notable cognitive decline was also observed in the MCI-Stable group, with z-scores ranging from -0.01 - -2.24 compared to normative data. Conclusion: This study highlights the amount of cognitive decline that occurs in MCI, including for those who remain 'stable' and those who progress to dementia. It also demonstrates the value of the SRB method in more clearly quantifying cognitive decline, which may help identify individuals most vulnerable to MCI progression.  © 2023 - IOS Press.

One of the biggest challenges in designing VR Rehabilitation exercises is in choosing feedback strategies that guide the patient and give the appropriate success/failure indicators, without breaking their sense of immersion. A new strategy for feedback is proposed, using non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) to highlight important parts of the exercise the patient needs to focus on and fade out parts of the scene that are not relevant. This strategy is implemented into an authoring tool that allows rehabilitators specifying feedback strategies while creating exercise profiles. The NPR feedback can be configured in many ways, using different NPR schemes for different layers of the exercise environment such as the background environment, the non-interactive exercise objects, and the interactive exercise objects. The main features of the system including the support for universal render pipeline, camera stacking, and stereoscopic rendering are evaluated in a testing scenario. Performance tests regarding memory usage and supported frames per second are also considered. In addition, a group of rehabilitators evaluated the system usability. The proposed system meets all the requirements to apply NPR effect in VR scenarios and solves all the limitations with regard to technical function and image quality. In addition, the system performance has been shown to meet the targets for low-cost hardware. Regarding authoring tool usability rehabilitators agree that is easy to use and a valuable tool for rehabilitation scenarios. NPR schemes can be integrated into VR rehabilitation scenarios achieving the same image quality as non-VR visualizations with only a small impact on the frame rate. NPR schemes are a good visual feedback alternative. © The Author(s) 2024.",Feedback strategies; Non-photorealistic rendering; Rehabilitation; Virtual reality,Image quality; Patient rehabilitation; Rendering (computer graphics); Stereo image processing; Three dimensional computer graphics; Visual communication; Authoring tool; Background environment; Breakings; Different layers; Feedback strategies; Interactive exercise; NPR (nonphotorealistic rendering); Rehabilitation exercise; Render pipeline; Virtual worlds; Virtual reality,"""Virtual Reality and Exergames in Rehabilitation and Exercise""",Virtual Reality Interventions in Motor Rehabilitation and Sports for Older Adults,Impact of Visual and Virtual Reality Interventions in Sports and Rehabilitation

It is associated with weight gain, decreased fitness, increased cardiovascular risks, and increased risks for mental illnesses, like depression and anxiety. This article examines the relationships between sports activity and health developments among prisoners. We analyze data from the Hessian Prison Sports Study, conducted in 12 prisons of the federal state of Hesse, Germany. Results: Based on quantitative survey data of 568 prisoners in regular custody, our empirical findings show that inmates perceive substantial health declines since incarceration. They report substantial decreases in general health (d=-0.52) and life satisfaction (d=-0.84) as well as an increased number of health problems (d = 0.71). However, sport has a potential to buffer this decline of health. Prisoners engaged in sports report a less negative development of their health compared to inactive prisoners. The greater the amount of time spent with sports activities, the better are the health trajectories found. Conclusion: Findings add to the public health and prison sport literature by demonstrating health benefits of sporting activities in a vulnerable population group that almost inevitably is exposed to manifold strains and burdens. © 2023, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Exercise; Health care; Incarceration; Life satisfaction; Physical activity,,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Mental Health and Physical Activity in Times of COVID-19

Methods:: hFCPCs were stimulated with various cytokines and their combinations and expression of paracrine factors was examined to find an optimal priming factor. Human chondrocytes or SW982 synoviocytes were treated with interleukin-1β (IL-1β) to produce OA phenotype, and co-cultured with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I-C))-primed hFCPCs to address their anti-inflammatory effect by measuring the expression of OA-related genes. The effect of poly(I-C) on the surface marker expression and differentiation of hFCPCs into 3 mesodermal lineages was also examined. Results:: Among the priming factors tested, poly(I-C) (1 µg/mL) most significantly induced the expression of paracrine factors such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, histocompatibility antigen, class I, G, tumor necrosis factor- stimulated gene-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, transforming growth factor-β1 and hepatocyte growth factor from hFCPCs. In the OA model in vitro, co-treatment of poly(I-C)-primed hFCPCs significantly alleviated IL-1β-induced expression of inflammatory factors such as IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and IL-1β, and matrix metalloproteinases in SW982, while it increased the expression of cartilage extracellular matrix such as aggrecan and collagen type II in human chondrocytes. We also found that treatment of poly(I-C) did not cause significant changes in the surface marker profile of hFCPCs, while showed some changes in the 3 lineages differentiation.

Methods: Ten endurance-trained eumenorrheic women performed a submaximal test followed by an incremental test until exhaustion three times during one MC, early follicular phase (EFP), late follicular phase (LFP), and midluteal phase (MLP). During the submaximal test, the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) and utilization of fat and carbohydrates were analyzed; and, during the incremental test, VO2 peak, maximal heart rate, utilization of fat and carbohydrates, and RER were analyzed. Lactate levels were analyzed at rest, during the submaximal test, and after the incremental test. The anaerobic threshold was determined at RER = 1. Results: No significant differences (p <.05) between the MC phases were seen in a maximal heart rate or VO2peak. Similarly, VO2, heart rate, RER, fatty acid oxidation, and carbohydrate oxidation at 70, 80, 90, and 100% of VO2peak did not differ significantly between MC phases. There were no significant differences between these phases in resting lactate before the test or during the submaximal tests, though there was a significant difference in lactate concentration 3 minutes after the incremental test between the EFP and the LFP (p =.043). Conclusion: This study did not display variations in physiological parameters between EFP, LFP, and MLP, indicating similar aerobic capacity despite hormonal variations. This knowledge may be useful when planning for competition in aerobic events. © 2023 The Author(s).

VO is a contributing factor in running economy and injury risk, therefore VO feedback can have a positive impact on running performance. The validity and reliability of the VO measurements from wearable devices is crucial for them to be an effective training tool. The aims of this study were to test the validity and reliability of VO measurements from wearable devices against video analysis of a single trunk marker. Four wearable devices were compared: the INCUS NOVA, Garmin Heart Rate Monitor-Pro (HRM), Garmin Running Dynamics Pod (RDP), and Stryd Running Power Meter Footpod (Footpod). Fifteen participants completed treadmill running at five different self-selected speeds for one minute at each speed. Each speed interval was completed twice. VO was recorded simultaneously by video and the wearables devices. There was significant effect of measurement method on VO (p < 0.001), with the NOVA and Footpod underestimating VO compared to video analysis, while the HRM and RDP overestimated. Although there were significant differences in the average VO values, all devices were significantly correlated with the video analysis (R > = 0.51, p < 0.001). Significant agreement between repeated VO measurements for all devices, revealed the devices to be reliable (ICC > = 0.948, p < 0.001). There was also significant agreement for VO measurements between each device and the video analysis (ICC > = 0.731, p < = 0.001), therefore validating the devices for VO measurement during running. These results demonstrate that wearable devices are valid and reliable tools to detect changes in VO during running. However, VO measurements varied significantly between the different wearables tested and this should be considered when comparing VO values between devices. © 2022 Smith et al.

Design Systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Data sources AMED, MEDLINE, PEDro, Cochrane, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, EMBASE and PsycINFO without language or date restrictions up to 3 February 2023. Eligibility criteria RCTs that evaluated the efficacy of any pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies compared with control (placebo, sham, waiting list or no intervention) on pain intensity and disability in people with plantar fasciitis. Two reviewers independently screened eligible trials, extracted data, assessed the methodological quality of included trials and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations framework. Mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs were reported. Results Seventeen different therapies investigated in 28 trials were included in the quantitative analysis. For non-pharmacological therapies, moderate certainty evidence showed short-term effects of customised orthoses on pain intensity when compared with control (MD of -12.0 points (95% CI -17.1 to -7.0) on a 0-100 scale). Low certainty evidence showed short-term effects of taping on pain intensity (-21.3 (95% CI -38.6 to -4.0)). Long-term effects and effects on disability are still uncertain. For pharmacological therapies, low to very low quality evidence from few trials with small samples was inconclusive and supports that high-quality trials are needed. Conclusions Moderate-quality and low-quality evidence demonstrates customised orthoses and taping, respectively, reduce pain intensity in the short term in patients with plantar fasciitis.

While existing literature primarily focuses on upper limb muscles, revealing a task-dependent nature in eliciting corticospinal responses, our aim was to investigate such responses after a single session of lower limb motor skill and resistance training. Twelve participants engaged in a visuomotor force tracking task, self-paced knee extensions, and a control task. Corticospinal, spinal, and neuromuscular responses were measured using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS). Assessments occurred at baseline, immediately post, and at 30-min intervals over two hours. Force steadiness significantly improved in the visuomotor task (P < 0.001). Significant fixed-effects emerged between conditions for corticospinal excitability, corticospinal inhibition, and spinal excitability (all P < 0.001). Lower limb motor skill training resulted in a greater corticospinal excitability compared to resistance training (mean difference [MD] = 35%, P < 0.001) and control (MD; 37%, P < 0.001). Motor skill training resulted in a lower corticospinal inhibition compared to control (MD; – 10%, P < 0.001) and resistance training (MD; – 9%, P < 0.001). Spinal excitability was lower following motor skill training compared to control (MD; – 28%, P < 0.001). No significant fixed effect of Time or Time*Condition interactions were observed. Our findings highlight task-dependent corticospinal responses in lower limb motor skill training, offering insights for neurorehabilitation program design. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.",Corticospinal excitability; Lower limb; Motor skill training; Resistance training; Transcranial magnetic stimulation,,"""Effects of Different Therapeutic Interventions on Muscular and Neural Health""",Muscle Rehabilitation and Training Effects in Injury Recovery,Muscle Strength and Recovery in Sports Performance

Influence of body composition, load-velocity profiles, and sex-related differences on army combat fitness test performance. J Strength Cond Res 37(12): 2467-2476, 2023 - The Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT) became the U.S. Army's mandatory physical fitness test in April of 2022. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between ACFT performance and both body composition and velocity profiles and to determine sex differences for these variables. Data were collected at 2 timepoints 4 months apart, from male (n = 55) and female (n = 17) Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) cadets. Body composition was assessed with a bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy device, and cadets completed a hex bar deadlift load-velocity profile (LVP) and ACFT on separate days. Stepwise multiple regressions were used to explain the amount of variance in ACFT total score and individual event performance. Significance for statistical tests was defined as an alpha level of p ≤ 0.05. Muscle mass and body fat percentage accounted for 49% of shared variance of total ACFT score, and deadlift maximal power and maximal velocity accounted for 67% of shared variance of total ACFT score. The 3 repetition maximum deadlift, standing power throw, hand-release push-up, and sprint-drag-carry events favored cadets with more muscle mass, whereas the leg tuck was influenced by the body fat percentage and the 2-mile run was affected by fat mass. Sex had greater predictive capability for the 2-mile run than body composition. Men outperformed women on all individual events, with the greatest differences on standing power throw and sprint-drag-carry. It is recommended that Army ROTC cadets taking the ACFT maximize lower-body power production and increase muscle mass. © 2023 NSCA National Strength and Conditioning Association.

These remote sessions include therapeutic exercises that can be done at home, potentially extending the reach of rehabilitation services to underserved areas, prolonging the duration of care and providing improved supervision. The study’s main purpose is to determine if the Knee Care at Home (KC@H) programme is more effective than conventional CR alone in improving patient-reported, clinician-reported and physical functional performance outcome measures after ACLR. Additionally, the trial assesses the significance of changes in outcome measures for clinical practice. This protocol outlines a randomised controlled trial for postoperative recovery following ACLR. Adult participants of both sexes who meet specific criteria will be randomly assigned to either the CR group or the KC@H group. Only the latter group will receive internet-based sessions of therapeutic exercises at home and CR sessions. A follow-up evaluation will be conducted for both groups 12 weeks after the intervention ends. The trial protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Universidade de Évora and complies with the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association. All recordings will be stored on a secure server with limited access and deleted as soon as they are no longer needed. The KC@H programme is expected to be superior to conventional CR for patients recovering from ACLR across multiple outcome measures.

There are premises that a combination of these two modalities brings additional benefits, particularly in improving insulin sensitivity. The retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) may inhibit signaling from insulin metabolic pathways in skeletal muscles, thus developing insulin resistance. This study aimed to evaluate whether moderate intensity circuit training combining strength and endurance exercise induces changes in tissue insulin sensitivity, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and serum RBP4 levels in insulin-resistant women. Methods: In this clinical controlled trial women diagnosed with insulin-resistance were randomly divided into two groups. The training group (T) performed circuit training combining strength (50%-80%1RM) and endurance (50%-75%HRR) exercise on five weight and two cardio machines, for 33 minutes, three times per week, for 3 months. Women from the control non-training group (NT) did not change their previous physical activity. At the beginning of the study and after the intervention period, a one-repetition maximum, body mass, and composition, resting heart rate (HR), blood pressure, glucose, insulin, blood lipids, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), RBP4, and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were measured. The results of 27 patients were analyzed using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. Results: Significant differences in the pattern of change over time between the groups for resting HR (p < 0.010) and total lean mass (p < 0.039) were found. No differences in HOMA-IR, and RBP4 were observed post-study compared to pre-study in the T group. A significant correlation between RBP4 and TSH concentration was found. Conclusion: Twelve-week circuit training combining strength and endurance exercise has minor effects on HOMA-IR, glucose and lipid metabolism, IGF-1, TSH, and RBP4. Although moderate-intensity circuit training is considered safe, its effectiveness in patients with overweight and mild obesity may be insufficient to reduce insulin resistance.

Methods: Data of 83 consecutive patients undergoing primary unilateral total hip arthroplasty were assessed. Using a pin inserted into the iliac crest to define the cup placement angle under anesthesia before and after total hip arthroplasty, the posterior pelvic tilt angle was determined as the change in pin tilt from the supine position to maximum hip flexion. Flexion range of motion under anesthesia was calculated as the difference in the angle between the trunk and thigh at maximum flexion and the posterior pelvic tilt angle. Flexion range of motion with a fixed pelvis measured preoperatively by a physical therapist was compared to that under anesthesia. A goniometer was used for all measurements and the number of measurements was one. Findings: Mean posterior pelvic tilt angle of the pin inserted into the pelvis under anesthesia was 15.8° ± 5.3° (3°–26°) preoperatively and 12.1° ± 4.9° (3°–26°) postoperatively. Mean flexion range of motion under anesthesia was 109.4° ± 6.9° (88°–126°) and that measured by a physical therapist was 101.1° ± 8.2° (80°–120°); the difference was significant (9.7°; p < 0.01). Interpretation: These results highlight the difficulty in accurately determining hip flexion angles without the use of special devices and may help surgeons and physical therapists recognize and address this issue. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Hip flexion angle; Hip range of motion; Pelvic tilt compensation; Total hip arthroplasty,"Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip; Hip Joint; Humans; Pelvis; Posture; Range of Motion, Articular; Thigh; Anesthesiology; Arthroplasty; Physical therapy; Hip flexion; Hip flexion angle; Hip range of motion; Measurements of; Pelvic tilt; Pelvic tilt compensation; Range-of-motion; Tilt angle; Tilt compensation; Total hip arthroplasty; adult; Article; controlled study; female; femur head necrosis; general anesthesia; greater trochanter; hip flexion angle; human; iliac crest; limit of agreement; major clinical study; male; observational study; osteoarthritis; pelvic tilt; physiotherapist; posterior pelvic tilt; range of motion; retrospective study; supine position; thigh; total hip replacement; trunk; visual analog scale; body position; diagnostic imaging; hip; hip replacement; pelvis; procedures; surgery; Orthopedics","""Hip Arthroscopy: Procedures, Outcomes, and Associated Technologies""",Hip Arthroscopy and Outcomes Analysis,Hip Arthroscopy Outcomes and Rehabilitation

In these patients, rehabilitation can improve functional capacity, reduce deconditioning after a prolonged stay in the intensive care unit, and facilitate the return to work. Thus, the present study verified the effects of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation consisting of continuous aerobic and resistance training of moderate-intensity on pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, maximum and submaximal tolerance to exercise, fatigue, and quality of life in post-COVID-19 patients. Methods: Quasi-experimental study with a protocol of 12 sessions of an outpatient intervention. Adults over 18 years of age (N = 26) with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and hospital discharge at least 15 days before the first evaluation were included. Participants performed moderate-intensity continuous aerobic and resistance training twice a week. Maximal and submaximal exercise tolerance, lung function, respiratory muscle strength, fatigue and quality of life were evaluated before and after the intervention protocol. Results: Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation improved maximal exercise tolerance, with 18.62% increase in peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) and 29.05% in time to reach VO2peak. VE/VCO2slope reduced 5.21% after intervention. We also observed increased submaximal exercise tolerance (increase of 70.57 m in the 6-min walk test, p = 0.001), improved quality of life, and reduced perceived fatigue after intervention. Discussion: Patients recovered from COVID-19 can develop persistent dysfunctions in almost all organ systems and present different signs and symptoms. The complexity and variability of the damage caused by this disease can make it difficult to target rehabilitation programs, making it necessary to establish specific protocols. In this work, cardiopulmonary rehabilitation improved lung function, respiratory muscle strength, maximal and submaximal exercise tolerance, fatigue and quality of life.

During these impacts, the head experiences rapid acceleration similar to what occurs during a concussion, but without the clinical implications. The physical mechanism and response to repetitive impacts are not completely understood. The objective of this work was to examine the immediate functional outcomes of sub-concussive level impacts from soccer heading in a natural, non-laboratory environment. Methods: Twenty university level soccer athletes were instrumented with sensor-mounted bite bars to record impacts from 10 consecutive soccer headers. Pre- and post-header measurements were collected to determine hyper-acute changes, i.e., within minutes after exposure. This included measuring blood flow velocity using transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound, oxyhemoglobin concentration using functional near infrared spectroscopy imaging (fNIRS), and upper extremity dual-task (UEF) neurocognitive testing. Results: On average, the athletes experienced 30.7 ± 8.9 g peak linear acceleration and 7.2 ± 3.1 rad/s peak angular velocity, respectively. Results from fNIRS measurements showed an increase in the brain oxygenation for the left prefrontal cortex (PC) (p = 0.002), and the left motor cortex (MC) (p = 0.007) following the soccer headers. Additional analysis of the fNIRS time series demonstrates increased sample entropy of the signal after the headers in the right PC (p = 0.02), right MC (p = 0.004), and left MC (p = 0.04). Discussion: These combined results reveal some variations in brain oxygenation immediately detected after repetitive headers. Significant changes in balance and neurocognitive function were not observed in this study, indicating a mild level of head impacts. This is the first study to observe hemodynamic changes immediately after sub-concussive impacts using non-invasive portable imaging technology. In combination with head kinematic measurements, this information can give new insights and a framework for immediate monitoring of sub-concussive impacts on the head.

Evidence is lacking on the quantified inequality measures (e.g., how big the inequality is, and the distribution) in order to identify the most vulnerable groups of a population. This study measured PA inequality among Thai adults by using three parameters to construct an inequality index: (1) Proportion of the population with sufficient MVPA; (2) Cumulative minutes of MVPA; and (3) The Gini coefficient. Methods: This study employed three rounds of data from Thailand’s Surveillance on Physical Activity (SPA) 2019–2021. In each round, over 6,000 individuals age 18–64 years were selected as nationally-representative samples, and were included in the analysis. PA inequality was constructed by using three parameters, with a combination of the three as the final measure, to identify the sub-groups of the Thai adults who are most vulnerable: groups with the least MVPA, highest insufficiency, and highest inequality index (Gini). Results: Covid-19 containment measures have widened the gap in PA inequality, as shown by a declining proportion of the population meeting the recommended guidelines, from 74.3% in 2019 to 56.7% in 2020 and 65.5% in 2021. PA inequality existed in all sub-populations. However, by combining three parameters, the most vulnerable groups during the Covid-19 epidemic were identified as follows: (1) Those with no income; (2) The unemployed; (3) Those who have no access to PA facilities; (4) Older adults aged 60 + years; and (5) Those earning < 3,500 baht per month. Further, residents of Bangkok, young adults aged 18–24, individuals who attained primary level education or less, those who had no exposure to a PA awareness campaign and those who have a debilitating chronic disease also had elevated risk of PA insufficiency. Conclusion: A concerning level of PA inequality existed in all sub-populations. The use of combined indicators in measuring PA inequality should aid in determining the most vulnerable groups of the population with a refined procedure. This method can be applied in many settings since the baseline data used to measure inequality (i.e., percent sufficient and cumulative minutes of MVPA) are widely available. © 2022, The Author(s).",Covid-19 epidemic; MVPA; PA inequality; Vulnerable population,Aged; COVID-19; Exercise; Humans; Thailand; Young Adult; Bangkok; Central Region [Thailand]; Krung Thep Mahanakhon; Thailand; COVID-19; disease; epidemic; equity; health risk; risk factor; vulnerability; adult; aerobic exercise; Article; awareness; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; correlation analysis; curfew; educational status; female; global physical activity questionnaire; health disparity; high intensity exercise; human; income; infection prevention; international physical activity questionnaire; internet access; male; moderate intensity exercise; pandemic; physical activity; practice guideline; primary education; public health message; rapid assessment of physical activity; refining index; rural population; social status; Thai (people); travel restriction; unemployment; urban population; virus transmission; vulnerable population; young adult; aged; epidemiology; exercise; Thailand,"""Physical Activity and Health Outcomes in Aging Populations""",Physical Activity and Health in Older Adults,Physical Activity and Health Risks

In this context, predictors of UM athletes' physical performance are in high demand; however, data on the predictive capabilities of hematological variables are still sparse. In the present paper, we retrospectively took into consideration the pre-race blood biomarker levels (including basic blood count, leukocyte subpopulations, markers of inflammation and organ function, metabolic profile, and electrolytes) of 50 UM athletes (M = 33, F = 17) who completed a 24-h competition in order to identify a combination of analytes capable of predicting the athletic performance in terms of distance covered during the 24-h run. The multiple regression analysis produced a model that explained a significant portion of the variance in the dependent variable, with an adjusted R-squared value of 0.783 (F(13, 36) = 14.58, p < 0.001). A greater race distance was correlated with higher pre-race values of hematocrit, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total cholesterol, HDL/LDL ratio, and triglycerides and lower levels of monocytes, eosinophils, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), total proteins, and sodium. This study represents the first of its kind conducted on 24-h UM athletes that investigated the association between blood markers and endurance performance. Our model, given its promising predictive power, would serve as a starting point that will require refinement and integration with other traditional performance prediction measures, in order to support athletes and coaches in better managing the training loads during the race-approaching phases. © 2024 The Authors.

Correlational evidence on the relationships between physical activity, sedentary behavior, and cognition has been mixed and limited to a few activity measures. The collinearity of accelerometry-based metrics has precluded an assessment of the full activity spectrum. Here, we aimed to examine the rich set of activity measures using analytic approaches suitable for collinear metrics. We investigated the combination of physical activity, sedentary, and clinicodemographic measures that explain the most variance in composite scores of working memory/processing speed, visual memory, and verbal memory. Methods: We analyzed baseline accelerometry and neuropsychological data (n = 80) from a randomized controlled trial of pedometer tracking. Using partial least squares regression (PLSR), we built three models to predict latent scores on the three domains of cognition using 12 activity metrics, sex, education, and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores. Significance was assessed using linear regression models with model component scores as predictors and cognitive composites as outcomes. Results: The latent component was significant for working memory/processing speed but was not significant for visual memory and verbal memory after Bonferroni correction. Working memory/processing speed was positively associated with average kilocalories, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), steps, and sex (i.e., higher scores in males) and negatively related to duration of long sedentary bouts and EDSS. Conclusions: These findings suggest that increasing overall energy expenditure through walking and MVPA, while decreasing prolonged sedentary time may positively benefit working memory/processing speed in people with MS.

Heterogeneity in the outcome variables varied mainly between low to moderate. Large inter-individual variations were observed in physical training volume, including decrements especially in endurance training frequency and volume.

However, there is a lack of effective interventions that address sensory facilitation to improve walking balance. Stochastic Resonance (SR) stimulation involves delivering sub threshold noise to improve balance in patients with sensory deficits by enhancing the detection of sensory input. Research question: To investigate the immediate effects of SR on walking balance in individuals with and without CP. Methods: Thirty-four participants (17 CP, 17 age-and sex-matched typically developing controls or TD) between 8 and 24 years of age were recruited. SR stimulation was applied to the muscles and ligaments of ankle and hip joint. An optimal SR intensity during walking was determined for each subject. Participants walked on a self-paced treadmill for three trials of two minutes each using a random order of SR stimulation (SR) and no stimulation (noSR) control conditions. Our primary outcome measure was minimum lateral margin of stability (MOS). Secondary outcome measures include anterior MOS before heelstrike and spatiotemporal gait parameters. We performed two-way mixed ANOVAs with group (CP, TD) as between-subject and condition (noSR, SR) as within subject factors. Results: Compared to walking without SR, there was a small but significant increase in the lateral and anterior MOS with SR stimulation, implying that a larger impulse was needed to become unstable, in turn implying higher stability. Step width and step ength decreased with SR for the CP group with SR stimulation. There were no significant effects for other spatiotemporal variables. Significance: Sub threshold electrical noise can slightly improve walking balance control in individuals with CP. SR stimulation, through enhanced proprioception, may have improved the CP group's awareness of body motion during walking, thus leading them to adopt a more conservative stability strategy to prevent a potential fall. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Fall risk; Gait; Locomotion; Postural control; Stochastic resonance,Adolescent; Adult; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Gait; Humans; Postural Balance; Vibration; Walking; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; ankle; Article; body equilibrium; cerebral palsy; child; clinical article; controlled study; female; hip; human; ligament; male; muscle; outcome assessment; step length; step width; stimulation; stochastic model; walking; body equilibrium; complication; gait; physiology; vibration; young adult,"""Effects of Various Interventions on Postural Stability and Balance Control""",Postural Stability and Lower Limb Motor Control Studies,Wearable Devices and Techniques in Gait Analysis and Mobility Rehabilitation

This narrative review summarizes various numerical methods used to calculate vertical jump height. In force plate technology, the jump height is most commonly calculated using the flight time (FT) or the takeoff velocity (TOV), which provide only the distance traveled in the air and neglect the center of mass (CoM) elevation before the jump. However, CoM is already elevated before the takeoff, mainly due to plantar flexion of the ankles. Double integration methods can be used to circumvent this issue. In field-based testing, the “heel lift constant” can be added to flight height to more accurately determine the jump height according to the biomechanical definition (the vertical difference in body’s CoM between standing position and the apex of the jump). A high degree of caution should be used when comparing the data from previous studies. © 2023 The Author(s).

Recently, links between GJH, anxiety, emotional and mental wellbeing have been established. The experiences of GJH in professional dance artists (five male, four female; mean age = 32.3 yrs; range = 25–40 yrs) and Ballet masters (3 female & 1 male, mean experience 30.8 yrs.) were exploredthrough semi-structured interviews (45-60 min). A biopsychosocial filter and qualitative reflective thematic approach were appliedto the analysis. Emerging themes include; hypermobile aesthetic, professional values and preconceptions, choreographic trends, company strategies, intellectual curiosity, pedagogy and leadership. Participants agreed dancers with GJH characteristics met the direction and desired aesthetic for today’s dance companies and choreographers. They showed a good understanding of the strengths and challenges of GJH but did not directly associate any psychosocial traits. The findings demonstrate that whilst commonly exploited for choreographic gains, the health risks and experience of GJH are not understood in the professional dance environment. Finally, we translate the practical implications of our findings for teaching dance in developmental environments. © 2021 The Author(s).

METHODOLOGIC APPROACH: Following a qualitative descriptive approach, four in-person focus groups were conducted and discussions were analyzed using inductive content analysis. FINDINGS: Participants described four considerations for peer matching: (a) personal characteristics, (b) physical activity characteristics, (c) cancer characteristics, and (d) finding a peer. Similarities in age, life phase, location, history of physical activity, type of cancer, severity of cancer, and personality were integral. An online or mobile application and the ability to create multiple partnerships were preferred.

However, there is no research examining the effect of throwing-related pain on this relationship. This study investigated the relationship between scapular position and range of motion (ROM) and compared the difference in this relationship between with and without throwing-related pain. Methods: Forty male baseball players in high school were recruited for this study. The existence and degree of throwing-related pain were obtained from a questionnaire. Participants were divided into 2 groups according to the presence or absence of the pain. Glenohumeral internal and external rotation ROM (abduction internal rotation angle and abduction external rotation angle [ABER], respectively) were measured using a digital inclinometer. The pectoralis minor muscle length was measured using a vernier caliper and scapula index, which indicated the scapular position, measured using a measuring tape. All these measurements were taken on both dominant and nondominant sides. The GIRD and total motion arc (TMA) deficit were calculated from the ROM measurements. Groups were compared using a mixed-model analysis of variance. Results: There was a significant interaction between group and ABER dominance. Other variables were not seen as the interaction effect. There was a significant positive correlation between the scapula index and TMA (r = 0.47, P =.02) and a negative correlation between the scapula index and GIRD (r = −0.65, P <.01) in the dominant side of the pain group. In addition, in the nondominant side of the pain group, the scapula index and ABER were significantly correlated (r = 0.43, P =.04). Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that the scapular position is associated with the glenohumeral ROM in high school baseball players. In addition, this study demonstrated that the scapular internally rotated position was correlated with the GIRD and TMA deficit in high school baseball players who had throwing-related pain. On the other hand, the scapular externally rotated position was correlated with increased ABER, mainly in the pain-free baseball players or on the nondominant side. These results indicated that the scapular position might affect the glenohumeral rotational ROM in high school baseball players. © 2022 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees",baseball players; Case-Control Design; Epidemology Study; glenohumeral range of motion; high school; Level Ⅲ; Scapular position,"Baseball; Humans; Male; Range of Motion, Articular; Scapula; Schools; Shoulder Joint; abduction external rotation angle; abduction internal rotation angle; acromion; adolescent; anatomic landmark; anatomical location; Article; baseball player; case control study; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; glenohumeral internal rotation deficit; high school; human; male; muscle length; musculoskeletal system parameters; pectoralis minor muscle; questionnaire; range of motion; scapula; scapular index; shoulder disease; shoulder injury; shoulder joint; shoulder pain; total motion arc; baseball; joint characteristics and functions; physiology; scapula; school; shoulder","""Muscle Strength, Endurance, and Injury Risk in Upper-Extremity Sports Performance""",Muscular Strength and Injury Risk in Athletes,Injury Risk and Performance in Athletes

Methods: This was a secondary analysis of data collected in a previous randomised controlled trial (RCT). Video images of US-guided subacromial corticosteroid injections delivered in the RCT were reviewed to categorise injection accuracy into three groups: definitely/probably not in the subacromial bursa (Group 1); probably in the subacromial bursa (Group 2); and definitely in the subacromial bursa (Group 3). The primary outcome was the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) total score. Secondary outcomes included SPADI pain and function subscales and participants' self-reported global impression of change. Outcomes were compared between the accuracy groups after adjusting for pre-selected baseline characteristics. Results: US-guided injection accuracy data were available for 114 participants: 22 categorised into Group 1, 21 into Group 2 and 71 into Group 3. There were no significant differences in mean total SPADI scores between the three injection accuracy groups at 6 weeks (Group 2 vs. 1: 8.22 (95% CI −4.01, 20.50); Group 3 versus 1: −0.57 (95% CI −10.27, 9.13) or 6 months (Group 2 vs. 1: 12.38 (95% CI −5.34, 30.10); Group 3 versus 1: 3.10 (95% CI −11.04, 17.23). Conclusions: The accuracy of injection placement in SAPS did not influence pain and function, suggesting that improvements in patients' outcomes using subacromial corticosteroid injections can be achieved without US guidance. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",corticosteroid injection; shoulder pain; subacromial pain syndrome; ultrasound,,Advancements in Therapies and Technologies for Osteoarthritis and Joint Disorders,Therapeutic Interventions and Their Efficacy in Osteoarthritis Treatment,Shoulder Surgery Outcomes and Measures

It remains uncertain whether adding extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) or low-level laser therapy (LLLT) to conventional treatment benefits CTS patients. Purpose: This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of ESWT and LLLT in conjunction with conventional treatments (including carpal mobilization, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and ultrasound) on the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve and pain in mild-to-moderate CTS patients. Study Design: This was a single-blinded randomized clinical trial with registration number IRCT20220504054734N1. Methods: Thirty-six patients were randomly assigned using block balanced randomization to receive either four sessions of ESWT or 10 sessions of LLLT in addition to 10 sessions of conventional treatments over 2 weeks. Patients received numbered closed envelopes indicating their treatment group. CSA (primary) and pain (secondary) in 18 patients who completed the treatment were assessed at baseline and after 2 weeks by a blinded assessor. Paired and independent sample t-tests were used for analyses due to the normal distribution of data was checked by Kolmogorov-Smirnoff. Cohen's d effect size was used to assess the intervention's magnitude. Results: Both ESWT and LLLT groups showed significant improvements in CSA (p = 0.002) and pain (p < 0.001) from baseline to posttreatment. CSA improvement was moderate for ESWT (mean difference: 1.2, 95% CI 0.51-1.9) and mild for LLLT (mean difference: 0.76, 95% CI 0.4-1.14). Conversely, pain improvement was substantial in both groups (ESWT: mean difference 4.4, 95% CI 3.6-5.3; LLLT: mean difference 4.4, 95% CI 3.7-5.2). No substantial differences between ESWT and LLLT were observed, highlighting their comparable efficacy. Conclusion: The addition of either LLLT or ESWT to conventional treatment effectively reduced pain and median nerve CSA in mild-to-moderate CTS. The absence of significant differences between ESWT and LLLT indicates their comparable efficacy in pain relief and CSA reduction. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",Carpal tunnel syndrome; Cross-sectional area; Extracorporeal shock wave therapy; Low-power laser; Visual analog scale,,"""Advancements and Efficacy of Therapies in Orthopedics and Sports Medicine""",Clinical Analysis and Trials in Therapy Treatments,Management and Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

Methods: Eight adolescents with cerebral palsy, Gross Motor Function Classification System levels I-II, 11–16 years, participated in 24 community-based group HLMP sessions across 12 weeks. Participants set attendance, involvement, and physical performance goals, completed activity diaries over 58 weeks and undertook physical capacity tests. Measures of activity frequency and diversity (attendance) and involvement level were collected weekly across baseline (4–6 weeks), intervention (12 weeks), and nine months follow-up (including Covid lockdown). Results: Median attendance was 23 of 24 HLMP sessions. Attendance goal/s attainment was highest during COVID lockdown. Involvement goals were consistently attained throughout all phases. Physical performance goal/s attainment was highest during intervention phase but reduced during nine months follow-up. Frequency of participation in physical activities varied greatly across study phases (range 0–33 episodes/week) with stable variety of activities and generally high ‘involvement.’ During the intervention, seven participants improved physical capacity and six maintained, or increased, the gains six months later.

The objective of this study was to analyze the outcome following traumatic first-time shoulder dislocation and subsequent surgical treatment in this population. Methods: In a retrospective study, climbers who experienced a traumatic shoulder dislocation were treated with an arthroscopic repair of the labrum-ligament complex (LLC). The functional outcome was assessed with a standardized questionnaire and clinical examination, including the Constant Murley and Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation scores. The sport-specific outcome was analyzed using the Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme (UIAA) scale of difficulty and a sport-specific outcome score. Results: The functional and sport-specific outcome for 27 climbers (20 men; 7 women; 3 with bilateral injuries; age, 34±11 [17–61] y; data presented as mean±SD [range]) was assessed 53±29 (12–103) mo after surgery. The postoperative Constant Murley score was 95±8 (67–100) points. At follow-up, 93% (n=25) of patients had started climbing again. Twenty-one climbers (78%) reached a climbing level within the range of ±0.33 UIAA grades of their initial capability or even exceeded their preinjury grade. Only 7% (n=2) of the patients had a recurrent shoulder dislocation, leading to a secondary surgery, and, therefore, required ongoing postoperative treatment at the time of follow-up.

This is a cross-sectional study with 1,298 community-dwelling older adults (≥60 years). SB was assessed by self-reporting daily time spent watching TV or using computer/internet (categorized into <2, 3–4, and ≥5 hr/day). Outcomes were handgrip strength, lower limb strength, gait speed, and balance limitations considering referenced cutoff points. Older adults in SB TV ≥5 hr/day had 1.75 (95% confidence interval [CI] [1.07, 2.86]) and 1.88 (95% CI [1.02, 3.46]) times more chances of handgrip strength and gait speed limitations, respectively. On the other hand, those who spent 3–4 and ≥5 hr/day in SB computer/internet had 0.45 (95% CI [0.20, 0.99]) and 0.37 (95% CI [0.15, 0.93]) had less chances of lower limb strength and balance limitations, respectively.

This study aims to investigate the relationship between fear of falling and frailty in older adults in Bushehr, Iran. Methods & Materials This descriptive-analytical study with a cross-sectional design was conducted on 215 older adults aged ≥60 years referred to urban comprehensive health centers in Bushehr, Iran in 2021 who were selected by a cluster sampling method. A demographic/clinical form, falls efficacy scale international (FES-I), and Fried’s frailty scale were used for collecting data. Data were analyzed using chisquare test, and logistic regression analysis in SPSS software, version 24. Results The mean age of the participants was 68.81±8.31 years. They included 56.7% female (n=122) and 43.3% male (n=93). The chance of developing frailty syndrome in people with high level of fear of falling was 6 times that of people with low fear of falling (OR=6.37, 95% CI, 1.44%-28.08%). The fear of falling was significantly higher in those with younger age, low education level, low income, those who were widower/widow, housekeeper or retired, and those with a history of falling in the last year, and frailty (P<0.001).

Objectives: We examined whether an online mentoring health intervention (OMHI) would strengthen characteristics that can prevent risky behaviors: resilience, perceived social support, psychological distress, and crisis concerns. Methods: Fifty-six secondary-school students participated, 27 in the intervention group and 29 in the control group (mean age 16.18, SD 0.83 vs. 16.62, SD 0.82, respectively). The study took place between March and August 2020. Results: The intervention group was less resilient pre-test, with similar resilience levels as the control group post-test. Intervention group participants presented a significantly higher crisis level pre- and post-test than the control group, as well as an increase in resilience (effect size = 1.88) and social support (effect size = 1.22), while psychological distress significantly decreased (effect size = −1.03). Both groups (intervention vs. control) predicted changes from pre-to-post test for resilience and crisis (adjusted R2 = 0.33, p = 0.001 and R2 = 0.49, p = 0.0001 respectively). Conclusions: OMHI participation was associated with improved resilience and social support, and decreased psychological distress, making it an effective strategy in health promotion for at-risk youth. An online intervention program combining mentoring in physical activity and interpersonal connections may constitute an effective health promotion strategy for at-risk youth, especially in times of crisis. © 2022 by the authors.",adolescents health; COVID-19 pandemic; health promotion; online intervention program; resilience; social support,adolescent; Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; correlation analysis; cross-sectional study; distress syndrome; effect size; emotional stability; female; health promotion; human; human relation; male; online monitoring; pandemic; physical activity; pilot study; pretest posttest design; program effectiveness; social resilience; social support assessment,"""Impacts of COVID-19 on Physical and Mental Health, Exercise Habits, and Rehabilitation Strategies""","Impact of COVID-19 on Health, Physical Activity and Quality of Life",Mental Health and Physical Activity in Times of COVID-19

However, the perceived barriers and facilitators for engaging in physical activity have been insufficiently studied and may differ between cultures. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the perceptions of community-dwelling physically inactive individuals with stroke about barriers and facilitators to their participation in physical activity. This qualitative study included two focus groups of ten individuals with stroke classified as physically inactive based on accelerometer recordings. A semi-structured set of questions was posed in each focus group session and the transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. The results revealed three main themes and subthemes: individual factors (physical impairments, psychological factors, spirituality), interaction with the family (attitudes of family members/close community) and social and environmental factors (hobbies, lack of or presence of facilities, the use of orthosis). We conclude that physical activity participation is affected by a multitude of factors as well as cultural differences. Thus, interventions aimed at increasing participation in physical activity after stroke should not only be planned according to individual clinical characteristics but also take into account a range of personal-to-social factors, including cultural differences. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

This study investigated the acute effects of CFI on sports performance, lower extremity muscle activity, and subjective comfort. Thirty young healthy males with shoe sizes between 260 and 270 mm performed various sports tasks (power generation, agility, and speed) and treadmill runs with wearable sensors under two experimental insole conditions (benchmark insole as a baseline, CFI). The results showed that, compared to the benchmark insole, CFI significantly improved sports performance in terms of power generation (~1.5%) and agility (~1%). However, it activated more of the Tibialis Anterior (~0.7%) and Gastrocnemius Medialis (~0.8%) muscles, and was perceived to be stiffer and less comfortable.

Currently, most manufacturers of motion-capture systems provide software applications for reconstructing the movement in real time, thus allowing for on-the-fly visualization. The captured kinematics can be later used as input data for a further musculoskeletal analysis. However, in advanced biofeedback applications, the results of said analysis, such as joint torques, ground-reaction forces, muscle efforts, and joint-reaction forces, are also required in real time. In this work, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) previously developed by the authors for real-time, whole-body motion capture and reconstruction is augmented with inverse dynamics and muscle-efforts optimization, enabling the calculation and visualization of the latter, along with joint-reaction forces, while capturing the motion. A modified version of the existing motion-capture algorithm provides the positions, velocities, and accelerations at every time step. Then, the joint torques are calculated by solving the inverse-dynamics problem, using force-plate measurements along with previously estimated body-segment parameters. Once the joint torques are obtained, an optimization problem is solved, in order to obtain the muscle forces that provide said torques while minimizing an objective function. This is achieved by a very efficient quadratic programming algorithm, thoroughly tuned for this specific problem. With this procedure, it is possible to capture and label the optical markers, reconstruct the motion of the model, solve the inverse dynamics, and estimate the individual muscle forces, all while providing real-time visualization of the results. © 2023, The Author(s).",Biofeedback; Biomechanics; Kalman filter; Motion capture; Musculoskeletal analysis,Application programs; Biofeedback; Dynamics; Extended Kalman filters; Inverse problems; Quadratic programming; Real time systems; Torque; Visualization; Human motion capture; Human movements; Inverse dynamics; Joint reaction forces; Joint torques; Motion capture; Muscle force; Musculoskeletal analyse; Optical motion capture; Real- time; Muscle,"""Application of Machine Learning and Biomechanics in Musculoskeletal Health and Wearable Devices""","Knee Assessment and Recovery: Validity, Reliability, and Clinical Trials",Wearable Devices and Techniques in Gait Analysis and Mobility Rehabilitation

Thus, digital health programmes can be an effective tool for implementing pain education strategies for public health. This trial will aim to analyse the implementation and effectiveness outcomes of three online pain science education strategies in the Brazilian public health system (SUS) for individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Methods: We will conduct a hybrid type III effectiveness-implementation randomised controlled trial with economic evaluation. We will include adult individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain, recruited from primary healthcare in the city of Guarapuava, Brazil. Individuals will be randomised to three implementation groups receiving a pain science education intervention (EducaDor) but delivered in different modalities: group 1) synchronous online; group 2) asynchronous videos; and group 3) interactive e-book only. Implementation outcomes will include acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, adoption, fidelity, penetration, sustainability, and costs. We will also assess effectiveness outcomes, such as pain, function, quality of life, sleep, self-efficacy, and adverse effects. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses will be conducted from the SUS and societal perspectives. The evaluations will be done at baseline, post-intervention (10 weeks), and 6 months. Discussion: This study will develop and implement a collaborative intervention model involving primary healthcare professionals, secondary-level healthcare providers, and patients to enhance self-management of chronic pain. In addition to promoting better pain management, this study will also contribute to the field of implementation science in public health by generating important insights and recommendations for future interventions.

This study aimed to determine the left ventricular (LV) response to increased exercise duration and intensity using novel echocardiographic tools to assess myocardial work and fatigue. Materials and methods: LV function was assessed by echocardiography before, immediately, and 24 h after a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) and a 91-km mountain bike leisure race. Cardiac Troponin I (cTnI) was used to assess myocyte stress. Results: 59 healthy recreational athletes, 52 (43–59) years of age, 73% males, were included. The race was longer and of higher intensity generating higher cTnI levels compared with the CPET (p < 0.0001): Race/CPET: exercise duration: 230 (210, 245)/43 (40, 45) minutes, mean heart rate: 154 ± 10/132 ± 12 bpm, max cTnI: 77 (37, 128)/12 (7, 23) ng/L. Stroke volume and cardiac output were higher after the race than CPET (p < 0.005). The two exercises did not differ in post-exercise changes in LV ejection fraction (LVEF) or global longitudinal strain (GLS). There was an increase in global wasted work (p = 0.001) following the race and a persistent reduction in global constructive work 24 h after exercise (p = 0.003). Conclusion: Increased exercise intensity and duration were associated with increased myocardial wasted work post-exercise, without alterations in LVEF and GLS from baseline values. These findings suggest that markers of myocardial inefficiency may precede reduction in global LV function as markers of myocardial fatigue.

The study investigated outcomes related to cancer-related fatigue (CRF), quality of life (QOL), physical activity, depression, anxiety, sleep quality, and social capital. Methods: Participants who had moderate or greater CRF were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 24), consisting of supervised and home-based exercise, or the control (n = 26), who received exercise leaflets. Generalized estimating equations models were fitted for the outcome variables. The assessment points were baseline (M1), immediately after completing the intervention at 12 weeks (M2), 1 month (M3), and 6 months post-intervention (M4). Results: A significant reduction in the total CRF score was found for both groups. We observed a significant time by group effect at M2, indicating a reduction of behavioral/severity CRF scores and a higher increase of physical activity. Also, there was an increase in the QOL score of both groups at M2, M3, and M4, compared to M1. Both groups had reduced anxiety at M3 and M4 compared to M1. The time by group effect for depression, sleep quality and social capital was not statistically significant. Conclusion: This 12-week exercise adherence program improved behavioral/severity CRF and physical activity post-intervention. Both the experimental group and control group showed significant improvements in CRF, QOL, and anxiety domains compared to the baseline, which extended to 6 months post-intervention.

Yoga is recommended in the field of athlete rehabilitation. This study investigated the effects of yoga intervention on functional movement patterns and mindfulness in collegiate athletes. It is a quasi-experimental study with a pre/post-test control design. The participants were divided into a yoga group and a control group. A Functional Movement Screen and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale were used to assess participants’ basic movement patterns and mindfulness before and after 12 weeks of yoga intervention (two classes per week, 90 min per class). The results show that the yoga group’s FMS scores improved more compared to the control group [F(1,78) = 29.08, p < 0.001, ŋp2 = 0.27], and that the scores for the deep squat (ŋp2 = 0.4), shoulder mobility (ŋp2 = 0.17), and trunk stability pushup (ŋp2 = 0.36) improved substantially. The dysfunctional score ratio for deep squats (χ2 = 18.57, p < 0.001), shoulder mobility (χ2 = 26.90, p < 0.001), trunk stability pushup (χ2 = 17.07, p < 0.001), and rotatory stability (χ2= 38.29, p <0.001) decreased significantly compared with the control group, but there was no significant improvement in asymmetric movement patterns (χ2 = 0.75, p = 0.39). The mindfulness scores in the yoga group significantly exceeded those of the control group [F(1,78) = 13.56, p < 0.001, ŋp2 = 0.15]. These results suggest that yoga intervention can improve functional movement patterns and mindfulness levels, but further evidence is needed to determine whether yoga could positively influence sports injuries. © 2022 by the authors.",functional movement screen; Mindful Attention Awareness Scale; student athlete; yoga asanas,Athletes; Athletic Injuries; Humans; Mindfulness; Sports; Yoga; experimental study; injury; mobility; physical activity; sport; student; active straight leg raise exercise; adolescent; adult; Article; assessment of humans; badminton; basketball; controlled study; exercise; female; football; Functional Movement Screen; human; human experiment; in line lunge exercise; male; Mindful Attention Awareness Scale; mindfulness; movement (physiology); musculoskeletal system parameters; normal human; quasi experimental study; rotatory stability exercise; scoring system; shoulder mobility exercise; sport injury; squatting (exercise); student athlete; taekwondo; tennis; trunk stability pushup; volleyball; wushu (sport); yoga; athlete; sport; sport injury,"""Pain Management and Musculoskeletal Health in Various Populations""",Chronic Pain Management and Treatment Studies,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Purpose: To use a network meta-analysis to analyze comparative studies of surgical treatment options for MIRCTs in patients <70 years of age for several patient-reported outcomes, range of motion (ROM), and acromiohumeral distance (AHD). Study Design: Network meta-analysis of comparative studies; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A systematic review of the literature, using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, of the MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases was conducted from 2017 to 2022. Inclusion criteria were (1) clinical comparative studies of MIRCTs (with several study-specific criteria); (2) ≥1 outcome of interest reported on, with standard deviations; (3) minimum 1-year follow-up; and (4) mean age of <70 years for both cohorts, without arthritis or pseudoparalysis. There were 8 treatment arms compared. Outcomes of interest were the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, Constant-Murley score, visual analog scale for pain, AHD, and forward flexion and external rotation ROM. A frequentist approach to network meta-analysis with a random-effects model was performed using the netmeta package Version 0.9-6 in R. Results: A total of 23 studies met the inclusion criteria, with 1178 patients included in the network meta-analysis. There was a mean weighted age of 62.8 years, 568 (48.2%) men, with a mean follow-up of 28.9 months. There were no significant differences between groups in regard to sex (P =.732) or age (P =.469). For the ASES score, InSpace balloon arthroplasty (mean difference [MD], 12.34; 95% CI, 2.18 to 22.50; P =.017), arthroscopic bridging graft (aBG) (MD, 7.07; 95% CI, 0.28 to 13.85; P =.041), and long head of biceps augmented superior capsular reconstruction (BSCR) (MD, 5.16; 95% CI, 1.10 to 9.22; P =.013) resulted in the highest P-scores. For the Constant-Murley score, debridement (MD, 21.03; 95% CI, 8.98 to 33.08; P <.001) and aBG (MD, 6.97; 95% CI, 1.88 to 12.05; P =.007) resulted in the highest P-scores. For AHD, BSCR resulted in the highest P-score (MD, 1.46; 95% CI, 0.45 to 2.48; P =.005). For forward flexion ROM, debridement (MD, 45.77; 95% CI, 25.41 to 66.13; P <.001) resulted in the highest P-score, while RSA resulted in the lowest P-score (MD, –16.70; 95% CI, −31.20 to −2.20; P =.024). Conclusion: For patients <70 years with MIRCT without significant arthritis or pseudoparalysis, it appears that graft interposition repair techniques, superior capsular reconstruction using the long head of the biceps tendon, arthroscopic debridement, and balloon arthroplasty provide superiority in various outcome domains, while RSA provides the least benefit in forward flexion. © 2024 The Author(s).",latissimus dorsi; lower trapezial tendon transfer; massive irreparable rotator cuff tear; network meta-analysis; reverse total shoulder arthroplasty; superior capsular reconstruction,,"""Shoulder Joint Health and Rehabilitation: Arthroscopic Surgeries, Treatments and Outcomes""",Clinical Outcomes and Treatments in Shoulder Care,Shoulder Surgery Outcomes and Measures

The objective of this study was to better understand how pets serve as emotional buffers and/or stressors for people diagnosed with breast cancer, and how their ability to meet their pet’s needs affects their well-being. Methods: A cross-section study of people diagnosed with breast cancer in the United States was conducted. Adults diagnosed with stages 0 (in situ) -IV breast cancer and currently the primary guardian of at least one dog or cat and owned the animal(s) for at least 6 months, were recruited for the study. A total of 211 responses, obtained between July – November 2022 were analyzed. The survey included questions about participants’ demographics; attachment to their pets; physical, emotional, and functional well-being; social support received from their pet; and ‘pet parenting’ concerns. Descriptive statistics were calculated to describe participants’ demographics. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine predictors of pet attachment, well-being, support from pet, and ‘pet parenting’ concerns. Results: People diagnosed with breast cancer derive substantial support from their pets (80% feel their pet makes them feel loved, needed, and offers a positive presence in the home), yet only 50% of participants feel this relationship is supported by their medical team. Controlling for owner demographics, heightened levels of pet-related guilt and concerns, along with lower perceived support from their pet, are all significant predictors of a lower quality of life. Conclusions: Findings highlight the benefits pets offer people diagnosed with breast cancer, yet also the distress they feel in trying to meet their pet’s needs. Assessment conversations about pet ownership, including pet-related support systems, are needed to validate people’s concerns and support the identification and development of pet support teams. Medical team facilitated discussions about pet care needs is suggested to demonstrate support for the pet-parent bond and help normalize feelings of guilt related to challenges in meeting their pet’s needs. These discussions could be aided through the development of research-driven intervention strategies and online, freely accessible targeted tools. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Breast cancer survivorship; Guilt; Pets; Stressors; Support,Adult; Animals; Breast Neoplasms; Dogs; Emotions; Female; Humans; Quality of Life; Social Support; Surveys and Questionnaires; adult; aged; animal care; Article; breast cancer; cancer staging; cancer therapy; cat; cross-sectional study; demographics; distress syndrome; dog; emotion regulation; emotional well-being; female; functional well-being; guilt; health care need; health care personnel; human; human-animal bond; major clinical study; pet therapy; physical well-being; physiological stress; pilot study; predictor variable; quality of life; social support; United States; wellbeing; animal; breast tumor; emotion; questionnaire,"""Physical Activity, Rehabilitation, and Health Outcomes in Medical Conditions""",Impact of Exercise and Rehabilitation on Quality of Life and Health in Patients,Exercise Programs and Physical Activity in Cancer Recovery

Method: A review of exercise science, neuroscience, and social science litera-ture was used to synthesize evidence and to outline the impact of physical activity and social engagement on cognition. The following topics were explored: How do exercise and social engagement support cognition? What are modifiable risk factors of dementia? What is the impact of inactivity and isolation on cognition? What is the potential role of the SLP on an interprofessional team focusing on preventive measures for cognitive decline? What is the impact of physical exercise and social engagement on nursing home residents? Results: Research increasingly points to the critical importance of physical activity and social engagement to prevent cognitive decline in normal aging and to slow cognitive decline associated with mild cognitive impairment and demen-tia. Research suggests that physical activity maintains or improves memory, attention, executive function, visuospatial function, speed of processing, and general cognitive function. Social engagement has been found to maintain and improve general cognitive function. Conclusions: Behavioral interventions are an effective strategy to prevent or slow cognitive decline in the older adult population. SLPs have a role to play on an interprofessional team that works to prevent cognitive decline. By considering factors that play a role in the prevention of cognitive decline, such as physical activity and social engagement, the quality of life and overall health of older adults can be improved.

The use of plyometric training is a popular method to enhance performance in players. OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to see the effect of short-duration plyometric training on vertical jump and sprint speed in volleyball players. METHOD: This study is a parallel group randomized controlled trial. Thirty-nine participants were screened for participation in the study, of which 30 were selected following the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study. The inclusion criteria for the study comprised of volleyball players of age group 18 to 24 years, both males and females, with playing experience of at least one year, and willing to participate. The exclusion criteria for the study included players with a history of injury in the last six months, any reported neurological or musculoskeletal disorder, and any psychological condition. The selected participants were randomly allocated to Group A and Group B using the lottery method. Group A was given plyometric training for three days a week and Group B was asked to continue their regular routine exercises and playing schedule. The total duration of the intervention was four weeks. The outcome measure for the study was sprint speed and vertical jump height. Sprint speed was measured by the 20 m sprint test, and the vertical jump height was measured by the Sargent jump test. The assessment was done at the baseline and at the end of four weeks. An unpaired t-test was used to analyze between-group differences, and paired t-test was used to analyze the within-group differences in the outcome variables. The significance level was set as p<0.05. RESULTS: The result of the study showed a significant improvement in vertical jump height (MD=-7.133, 95% CI-12.657,-1.609) and no significant improvement in sprint speed when between-group comparisons were made (MD=0.084, 95%CI-0.177,-.345) with an effect size of 0.75 for vertical jump height. The within-group comparison was found significant only for vertical jump height in Group A, and there was no significant improvement was found in sprint speed for both Group A and B. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: The short-duration plyometric training is effective in improving the vertical jump height and not the sprint speed in volleyball players. The specificity of plyometric training is important for optimal improvement in sports performance. © 2023, BAHIANA - School of Medicine and Public Health.

More recently, it has been associated with notions of mental health, and it has been suggested that long-distance walking may have psychotherapeutic effects. There is still, however, a lack of clarity regarding several central questions, including what long-distance walking is, and why it may be beneficial to mental health. In this article, we provide an overview of understandings and cultural expressions of the long-distance walk, and we provide a new definition, reaching across these various understandings and expressions. Next, we discuss the different explanations given regarding the therapeutic aspects of the long-distance walk, and suggest a new approach, leaning on an existential framework. Finally, we discuss the implications that the knowledge on long-distance walking has for notions of therapeutic interventions more generally. © 2022 The Authors",Exercise; Existentialism; Hiking; Long-distance walking; Mental health; Nature; Outdoor; Therapy; Trekking; Walking,,"""Physical Activity and Health Outcomes in Aging Populations""",Physical Activity and Health in Older Adults,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Seventy participants were enrolled, with 35 randomized to the ketorolac group and 35 to the placebo group.Intervention:The intervention used was 15 mg of intravenous (IV) ketorolac every 6 hours for up to 5 inpatient days or 2 mL of IV saline in a similar fashion.Main Outcome Measurements:Length of stay (LOS), morphine milligram equivalents, visual analog scale, and complications.Results:Study groups were not significantly different regarding age, body mass index, and New Injury Severity Score (P > 0.05). The median LOS was 8 days (interquartile range, 4.5-11.5) in the ketorolac group compared with 7 days (interquartile range, 3-10) in the placebo group (P = 0.275). Over the 5-day treatment period, the ketorolac group experienced a 32% reduction in average morphine milligram equivalents (P = 0.013) and a 12-point reduction in baseline-adjusted mean visual analog scale (P = 0.037) compared with the placebo group. There were no apparent short-term adverse effects in either group.Conclusions:Scheduled low-dose, short-term IV ketorolac was associated with significantly reduced inpatient opioid use and pain in orthopaedic polytrauma patients, with no significant difference in LOS and no apparent short-term adverse effects. The results support the use of scheduled low-dose, short-term IV ketorolac for acute pain control among orthopaedic polytrauma patients.

This study primarily aims to demonstrate the hypoalgesic effect on the tibial nerve using transcutaneous interferential-current nerve inhibition (TINI), which injects the kilohertz frequency produced by the interferential currents. Additionally, the secondary objective was to compare the analgesic effect and comfort of TINI and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). Thirty-one healthy adults participated in this cross-over repeated measures study. The washout period was set to 24 h or more. Stimulus intensity was set just below the pain threshold level. TINI and TENS were applied for 20 min each. The ankle passive dorsiflexion range of motion, pressure pain threshold (PPT), and tactile threshold were measured at the baseline, pre-test, test (immediately before ceasing intervention), and post-test (30 min after ceasing intervention) sessions. After the interventions, the participants evaluated the level of discomfort for TINI and TENS on a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS). As the results, PPT significantly increased compared to baseline in test and posttest sessions of TINI, but not in those of TENS. Also, participants reported that TENS was 36% more discomfort than TINI. The hypoalgesic effect was not significantly different between TINI and TENS. In conclusion, we found that TINI inhibited mechanical pain sensitivity and that the inhibitory effect persisted long after electrical stimulation ceased. Our study also shows that TINI provides the hypoalgesic effect more comfortably than TENS. © 2023, The Author(s).",,Adult; Humans; Pain; Pain Management; Pain Measurement; Pain Threshold; Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation; adult; analgesic activity; ankle; article; clinical article; comfort; controlled study; electrostimulation; female; human; human experiment; male; nociception; pain threshold; pressure pain threshold; pretest posttest design; range of motion; tibial nerve; transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; visual analog scale; analgesia; pain; pain measurement; physiology; procedures; transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation,"""Effects of Various Interventions on Postural Stability and Balance Control""",Postural Stability and Lower Limb Motor Control Studies,Management and Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

For these patients, a repeat fasciotomy is not ideal because they are older and post-surgi-cal scar tissue will make the fasciotomy technically challenging. Therefore, post-fasciotomy patients with CECS recurrence require new, non-surgical treatment options. Recent studies show botulinum toxin injections can be effective for the initial management of chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS) prior to surgery, especially in young patients primarily experiencing pain on exertion with minimal lower-extremity symptoms at rest. However, the ability to treat CECS recurrence status after fasciotomy with botulinum toxin injections of the legs has not been studied. Case Report: We present the first case where botulinum toxin was applied to this patient population. Our patient was a 60-year-old man with a 34-year history of CECS who, 8 years after his third bilateral fasciotomy, progressively developed rest pain in his calves bilaterally, paresthesias, and difficulties when walking or descending stairs, with multiple near-falls due to his toes catching on stair steps. OnabotulinumtoxinA (BTX-A) injections into the posterior and lateral compartments resolved baseline symptoms: within 2 weeks, he was able to walk, nego-tiate stairs symptom-free, and enjoy an overseas vacation without complications. Conclusions: Symptoms related to recurrent CECS status after multiple fasciotomies can successfully be treated with BTX-A injections. Our patient’s baseline mobility issues resolved within 2 weeks after the injection and remained that way for over 31 months. However, his exertional symptoms and rest pain recurred at 9 months, suggesting that BTX-A injections are not completely curative. © Am J Case Rep,.","Activities of Daily Living; Botulinum Toxins, Type A; Chronic Exertional Compartment Syndrome; Chronic Pain; Fasciotomy",Chronic Disease; Chronic Exertional Compartment Syndrome; Compartment Syndromes; Fasciotomy; Humans; Leg; Lower Extremity; Male; Middle Aged; Pain; botulinum toxin A; steroid; adult; Article; case report; clinical article; clinical feature; compartment syndrome; denervation; disease course; disease duration; disease exacerbation; drug administration; drug response; falling; fasciotomy; follow up; gastrocnemius muscle; human; leg pain; male; medical history; middle aged; muscle hypertrophy; pain; paresthesia; patient history of surgery; rehabilitation; stair climbing; treatment failure; walking difficulty; weakness; chronic disease; compartment syndrome; complication; fasciotomy; leg; lower limb; pain,"""Pain Management and Musculoskeletal Health in Various Populations""",Chronic Pain Management and Treatment Studies,Shoulder Surgery Outcomes and Measures

Purpose: To determine whether a validated clinical risk prediction tool for persistent postconcussive symptoms (PPCSs) predicted which patients would develop PPCSs when obtained within 14 days of concussion among a multicenter sample of adolescent athletes. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Pediatric and adolescent patients (8-18 years of age) from 7 pediatric medical centers and 6 secondary school athletic training facilities who were diagnosed with a concussion and presented ≤14 days after concussion were enrolled as part of the Sport Concussion Outcomes in Pediatrics (SCOPE) study during their initial visit and were followed until symptom resolution. Clinical risk scores (Predicting and Preventing Post-concussive Problems in Pediatrics [5P]) and total symptom severity were obtained using the Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory at the initial visit (mean, 4.9 ± 2.9 days after concussion). Participants were then compared based on symptom resolution time: PPCS group (≥28 days to symptom resolution) and no-PPCS group (<28 days). The authors assessed the odds of developing PPCSs based on the 5P risk score using a binary logistic regression model and the utility of the clinical risk prediction tool to identify total time to symptom resolution using a Cox proportional hazards model. Results: A total of 184 participants enrolled, underwent initial evaluation, and were followed until symptom resolution (mean age, 15.2 ± 2.1 years; 35% female). The mean time to symptom resolution across the entire sample was 17.6 ± 3.7 days; 16% (n = 30) of participants developed PPCS. Those in the PPCS group had significantly greater mean initial total 5P risk scores than those in the no-PPCS group (7.9 ± 1.7 vs 5.9 ± 2.3, respectively; P <.001). After adjustment for initial symptom severity, time to assessment, and assessment setting, a higher initial total 5P risk score was associated with a significantly greater odds of developing PPCSs (adjusted odds ratio, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.07-2.08; P =.019). Furthermore, a higher 5P risk score was significantly associated with longer total symptom resolution time (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.74-0.88; P <.001). Conclusion: In a multicenter sample of youth athletes seen in different outpatient health care settings, the 5P risk score accurately predicted which athletes may be at risk for developing PPCSs. © 2023 The Author(s).",adolescent athlete; concussion; persistent postconcussive symptoms,"Adolescent; Athletes; Athletic Injuries; Brain Concussion; Child; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Male; Post-Concussion Syndrome; Sports; adolescent; adult; article; athlete; child; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; genetic susceptibility; high school; human; human tissue; juvenile; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; outcome assessment; outpatient care; pediatrics; post-concussion symptom inventory; prediction; risk assessment; training; young adult; athlete; brain concussion; clinical trial; complication; newborn; postconcussion syndrome; sport; sport injury","""Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion: Studies on Impacts, Recovery, and Influences""",Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion Studies in Young Athletes,Post-Concussion Symptoms and Recovery in Adolescents

Although antidepressants and/or psychotherapy are often used to treat depression, some recent studies indicate that exercise may play an important role in lowering depression symptoms among patients meeting the clinical criteria of a depressive episode. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the mental health and wellbeing of adult participants diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) after fourteen weeks of receiving a supervised physical exercise program. Methods: In a pre-post design, the assessments were performed at baseline, seven weeks and fourteen weeks following the exercise intervention program using facilitated self-reported psychometric scales. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-2) and Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation—Outcome Measure (CORE-OM) were used to assess depression. The short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was used for the self-reporting of participants’ physical activity. Results: At the beginning of the study, the baseline total mean scores and standard deviations for the BDI-2, CORE-OM, and IPAQ in both genders did not differ significantly (p-value > 0.05). Patients showed significant improvement in all assessment scales after completing fourteen weeks of the physical exercise program. Based on the BDI-2, the baseline score dropped from 31.25 (indicating moderate to severe depression) to 14.25 (indicating mild to minimal depression), with a p-value of <0.001. The CORE-OM total mean score was reduced from 1.91 to 0.98 with a significant p-value < 0.005 indicating effective clinical improvement in depression symptoms. The IPAQ total MET-minutes/week mean score increased from 1713.22 to 4367.62, indicating an improvement in the participants’ weekly P.E. intake; however, the change was not statistically significant (p = 0.07). Conclusions: Exercise treatment is linked with considerable therapeutic improvement in patients with MDD, particularly when exercise is sustained over time. The BDI-2 and CORE-OM total scores significantly decreased after the fourteen-week P.E. programme, indicating a change from moderate and severe depression to minimal and mild depression. Our findings offer insightful information to primary care doctors and psychiatrists, indicating that prescribing exercise to depressed patients may be a helpful adjunctive therapy. © 2024 by the authors.",depression; exercise; mental health; physical activity; psychiatric patients,,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Impact of Physical Exercise on Mental Health Disorders

The female body's balance may be impacted by a number of important factors, including the menstrual cycle. Due to changes in sex hormone levels during menstruation, postural control and muscular coordination may be af-fected. The aim of this study was to compare the dynamic balance among female university students during menstrual and non-menstrual period’s students. Methodology: A comparative study was conducted among female university students to compare the differences in dynamic balance between menstrual and non-menstrual periods. Using the purposive sampling method, a total of 45 university students were recruited. Data were gathered using a validated self-administered questionnaire, and the subjects' dynamic balance was assessed using the Y-balance test. Results: The results indicate that the reach distance (anterior, posteromedial, posterolateral) for right and left stance shows an improvement during non-menstrual period when compared during menstruation (p< 0.001). Conclusions: Regardless of the dominant or non-dominant leg, the dynamic balance of females is better during non-menstruation than it is during menstruation. While recommending exercises to females or while they engage in sports activities, these balance fluctuations in females must be taken into account to mitigate health risks. © 2023 National Journal of Community Medicin.",Balance; Health risk; Menstruation; Sex Hormones; Y-Balance Test,,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Maximal muscular strength and its assessment, however, is not a primary assessment criterium in the selection of young talented dancers. Methods: The present study evaluated the within- and between session reliability, variability, and minimal detectable change (MDC) of the isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP). Thirty-five participants (female n = 17) participated in 2 identical assessments on the same day with 4-hour break in between. Three 3-second IMTP were performed, and the mean peak force value was used for the analyses. Results: Within-session the ICC indicated excellent reliability (ICC =.99, 95% CI: 0.98-0.99). Between-session reliability was excellent (ICC =.98, 95% CI: 0.95-0.99). The standard error of measurement was 4% (48 N), the minimum detectable change was 12% (134 N) and the CV was 3%. There were no within-session statistically significant differences, but statistically significant differences between-session were observed (P <.001). Limits of agreement ranged from −121 N (95% CI −186 to −56 N) to 307 N (95% CI 243-372 N). Conclusion: The observed results demonstrated excellent within- and between sessions reliability, low variability, and an MDC of 12%. The consistency of the within-session scores suggest that peak force data may be obtained with single try efforts. The statistically significant difference in the means of the retest session, however, suggests that the time of the day or the time since entrained awakening may be affecting performance in adolescent dancers. The results of the current study indicate that the IMTP is a reliable assessment tool for maximal muscular strength in adolescent dancers. © The Author(s) 2023.",maximal; muscular; screening; strength; testing,Adolescent; Dancing; Exercise Test; Female; Humans; Isometric Contraction; Male; Muscle Strength; Reproducibility of Results; Thigh; adolescent; dancing; exercise test; female; human; male; muscle isometric contraction; muscle strength; procedures; reproducibility; thigh,"""Sports-Related Injury, Rehabilitation, and Performance Studies""",Rehabilitation and Assessment in Athletes with Chronic Ankle Instability,Muscle Strength and Recovery in Sports Performance

Therefore, we investigated the prevalence of overtraining syndrome-like symptoms and correlative factors in 389 female and 572 male national-level high school track and field athletes. They were asked to complete a survey regarding their history of overtraining syndrome-like symptoms, injuries, and diseases. The survey results revealed that 13.4% (52/389) of female and 13.3% (76/572) of male athletes had a history of overtraining syndrome-like symptoms. Logistic regression analysis showed that training hours per day (odds ratio, 1.74; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-2.71) was an associated factor in female athletes, while rest days per week (odds ratio, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.37-1.00), skipping meals (odds ratio, 3.73; 95% confidence interval, 1.50-9.29), and having snacks/light meals on a regular basis (odds ratio, 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-0.83) were the associated factors in male athletes. In conclusion, athletes with overtraining syndrome-like symptoms may be prone to injuries and diseases. Hence, although overtraining syndrome is difficult to diagnose, further attention should be paid to minimize overtraining syndrome-related risks. © 2023 Georg Thieme Verlag.

The main aims were: to define the prevalence of morbidity leading to permanent medical downgrading; to determine at risk populations and identify areas for improvement. Method Database of personnel referred to the RAF Medical Board was analysed from January 2012 to October 2013 and January 2017 to December 2019. Patients were excluded if they did not require a formal medical board; incomplete and duplicate entries were also excluded. The primary reason for medical downgrade was categorised with an ICD-10 code. Further subanalysis compared musculoskeletal disease with age, individual trade groups and anatomic region. Results 2% of RAF service personnel were permanently downgraded annually. Musculoskeletal disease was the leading cause for permanent downgrade across both periods: 58% and 49%. Female personnel were at a greater risk of musculoskeletal downgrade compared with males. Spinal and knee pathology were the leading cause for downgrading among € high risk' personnel. Personnel downgraded due to musculoskeletal pathology were often retained in a limited role with 10% and 5% retained as medically fully deployable. 14% and 12% of personnel downgraded due to musculoskeletal pathology were medically discharged. Conclusion Musculoskeletal disease was the leading cause for permanent medical downgrades in the RAF. A greater proportion of downgraded personnel with musculoskeletal conditions were retained in service with medical limitations rather than medically discharged. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

Thirty-six young subjects (18 males and 18 females) ascended instrumented stairs while kinematic and kinetic data were measured. Mechanical variables of the lower limb joints and body posture on the sagittal plane were compared between genders, and their associations were also investigated. Female subjects exerted more mechanical work, power, and joint moment than male subjects at the knee joint, while males exerted more at the hip joint. Females and males showed a longer moment arm of ground reaction force at the knee and hip joints, respectively. The moment arm, but not the magnitude, of ground reaction force was strongly associated with the joint moment (r = 0.80–0.97). Females exhibited a more crouched stance limb (lower heel lift, greater ankle dorsiflexion, and knee flexion) than males. A more crouched and extended lower limb posture was found to be correlated with a longer moment arm at the knee and hip joints, respectively. Half of the variance in moment arm could be explained by the heel lift angle. The results indicate that females allocate greater work to the knee joint but less to the hip joint than males do in order to elevate body mass to a higher step during stair ascent. The work distribution strategy appears to be influenced significantly by posture, particularly the choice of foot contact method: heel-toe standing in females and toe standing in males. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Korean Society for Precision Engineering 2024.",Distribution; Gender difference; Lower limb; Mechanical work; Stair ascent; Strategy,Biomechanics; Hip prostheses; Physiological models; Stairs; Distribution; Gender-differences; Hip joints; Joint moment; Knee joint; Lower limb; Mechanical work; Moment arms; Stair ascent; Strategy; Joints (anatomy),"""Lower Extremity Health and Biomechanics: Studies on Pain, Function, and Treatment Methods""",Lower Limb Biomechanics and Pain Management in Chronic Conditions,Gender Differences in Musculoskeletal Health & Physical Fitness

Hip abductors' capacity to produce power through both torque and velocity is important for different human activities; hence, a reliable assessment of hip abduction is critical. The first aim of the study was to assess the intersession reliability of hip abductor muscles maximal torque and submaximal power and power during standing hip abduction in young adults using pneumatic resistance. A secondary aim was to investigate whether there was a relationship between hip abductor maximal torque and submaximal power and velocity with clinical assessments of strength and power in young adults. The subjects (n = 24; 26.0 ± 3.7 years) visited the laboratory 2 times. In the first visit, the subjects performed on a pneumatic resistance machine 1-repetition maximum (1RM) and submaximal tests (40, 60, and 70% of 1RM) of the hip abductors and clinical tests of lower-extremity strength and power (The 30-second chair stand test [30CST]; and stair climb power test). During the second visit, all tests were repeated except the clinical tests. One-repetition maximum torque and submaximal power and velocity (at all levels) had excellent reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient ≥ 0.943) with absolute reliability of 13.5% up to 28.3%. The agreement between days from Bland-Altman plots for power and velocity was near 0 for all levels. Hip abduction velocity had a significant positive correlation with 30CST at 60% (r = 0.416; p = 0.048) and 70% of 1RM (r = 0.442; p = 0.035). In conclusion, we showed an excellent intersession reliability of the hip abductor muscles 1RM torque and submaximal power and velocity using pneumatic resistance. Furthermore, we demonstrated that hip abduction velocity might be important for the performance of the 30CST. © 2023 NSCA National Strength and Conditioning Association.

Methods: The Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WanFang Data, China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), China Biology Medicine disc (CBM), PubMed, Embase, and guideline websites (such as the Chinese Medical Ace Base, the China Association of Chinese Medicine, the World Health Organization, Guideline International Network, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network) were searched from inception to October 31, 2022. In addition, the reference lists of relevant studies were reviewed to identify domestic and overseas massage CPGs/consensus. The search terms adopted a combination of subject words and free words, mainly including traditional Chinese medicine, complementary therapies, Tuina, massage, manipulation, chiropractic/osteopathic, spinal, acupressure, guideline, and consensus. Two researchers independently completed the eligible records and extracted the data. Before the formal research, calibrations were performed twice on AGREE II, and all reviewers completed the pilot test three times until they understood and reached an agreement on the assessment items. Three researchers appraised the methodological quality of the included guidelines using the AGREE II instrument and calculated the overall intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of agreement. Results: The evaluation results showed that among the 49 eligible CPGs/consensus, 4 (8.2%) CPGs/consensus were considered “recommended”, 15 (30.6%) CPGs/consensus were considered “recommended with modifications”, and 30 (61.2%) CPGs/consensus were considered “not recommended”, while the consensus was considered “not recommended”. Generally, the scores in the six domains of the guidelines were all higher than the consensus. Evaluation results for the overall quality of 36 CPGs showed that 4 (11%) were “good quality”, 15 (42%) were “sufficient quality” and 17 (47%) were “lower quality”. The AGREE II quality scores of domains ranged from 0.30 to 0.75 ([ICC = 0.993, 95% CI (0.992, 0.995)]). The domain of scope and purpose (domain 1), with a median score of 0.75 (0.52~0.91), performed best in the guidelines with AGREE II, and stakeholder involvement (domain 2) [median 0.39 (0.31~0.56)] and application (domain 5) [median 0.30 (0.17~0.47] obtained lower scores. The consensus score of domain 1 was better at 26.0 (21.6~44.8), followed by rigor of development (domain 3) with a score of 18.0 (10.0~28.9). A total of 119 massage-related recommendations were extracted from 49 guidelines/consensuses, including “in favor” (102, 85.7%), “against” (9, 7.6%), and “did not make recommendations” (8, 6.7%). Conclusion: The overall quality of the included guidelines was low, and most of the guidelines were not “recommended”. In future guideline updates, the existing evidence should be used, the professional composition of members of the expert group should be enriched, and patients’ values and preferences should be fully considered. It is necessary to clearly propose recognizable recommendations and strengthen the rigor and standardization of guideline formulation. Thus, clear standard guidelines can be formulated to better guide clinical practice. © The Author(s) 2024.",AGREE II; Consensus; Massage; Practice guideline; Quality assessment; Recommendation,"China; Databases, Factual; Humans; Massage; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; acupressure; appraisal of guidelines research and evaluation; Article; calibration; China; china biology medicine; Chinese medicine; chiropractic manipulation; CNKI database; consensus; correlation coefficient; Embase; human; massage; Medline; national institute for health and care excellence; practice guideline; publication; quality control; scottish intercollegiate guidelines network; spine manipulation; stakeholder engagement; stakeholder participation; WanFang Database; World Health Organization; Chinese medicine; factual database",Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Management and Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

AIM: This study was conducted to quantify the effect of intense exercise on the functional capacity and muscle power of obese individuals and the risk of knee osteoarthritis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present research project is characterized as a clinical trial, cross-sectional, and uncontrolled research. All participants had a body mass index from 30.6 kg/m2 to 34.9 kg/m2 and reported not working out in the last 3 months prior to this experiment. Before their involvement, all participants were informed during an initial interview about the experimental procedure, the nature of the research, and the test protocols. They gave their written and signed informed consent to voluntarily participate in this research and completed two questionnaires. Participants in our study were recruited from sports centers, social clubs, and word of mouth. A total of 78 participants responded to the call articipated in our training protocol which was composed of two main parts. The first one is the ≪Anthropometric measurements tests≫ and the second one is the ≪Functional capacity tests≫ that were done in a gym. The participants were divided randomly into two experimental. After the end of every phase of the experiment, some members of each group were moved randomly to the other group. RESULTS: The final results of the intra-class correlation coefficient measurements for a set of tests showed strong reliability among members of each examined group. For the handgrip strength tests of the right and left hands, the results were 0.850 and 0.892, respectively. For the squat jump and countermovement jump tests, the results were 0.966 and 0.932, respectively. The results were 0.896 and 0.945 for walking 6 meters with or without double tasks. Finally, for the TUG and TUP-DT tests, the results were 0.520 and 0.663, respectively. After analyzing and interpreting the data for the functional capacity tests, the following results were obtained: For the 5 sit-stand test, the result was (F (3.87)=4.22; p=0.008, ηp2=0.127). For the Time up and go test, the result was (F (3.87)=4.56; p=0.019, ηp2=0.136), and for the 6 m walk, the result was (F (3.87)=3.81; p=0.013, ηp2=0.116). Finally, the 5X sit-to-stand test at 48 hours was lower than the base value (p=0.024), while the TUG immediately after the post was lower than the base value. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate the positive impact of intense exercise on muscle power and functional capacity in obese individuals. These findings suggest that high-intensity physical activity may be an effective means of improving the health and quality of life of obese individuals. Therefore, it is recommended that obese individuals include high-intensity exercise in their regular exercise program to reap these health benefits. However, it is important to emphasize the importance of consulting a healthcare professional before starting a high-intensity exercise program to avoid the risk of injury or health complications. © 2023 Russian Association of Endocrinologists.

The sample comprised 29 handball players (18 men and 11 women), who carried out a throwing protocol to measure velocity, accuracy, and subjective perception. The main results found significant throwing velocity differences between the new balls and traditional balls with resin in short-distance actions (7 m). Specifically, males did not perceive a loss of throwing velocity with the new ball. For target accuracy, men showed higher velocities with the traditional balls with resin and new balls than with the traditional balls with no resin. Women reached higher velocities with the new balls and the traditional balls with resin than with the traditional balls with no resin. Furthermore, throwing accuracy and effectiveness were not influenced by the ball type or throwing distance. While uneven results in relation to throwing velocity according to ball type, gender, and throwing distance were identified, the accuracy and effectiveness were not affected by the ball type. As the throws were made from further away (9 m), the impact of the new ball on the throwing velocity decreased. © 2022 by the authors.",accuracy; equipment; performance; team sport; velocity,,"""Muscle Strength, Endurance, and Injury Risk in Upper-Extremity Sports Performance""",Muscular Strength and Injury Risk in Athletes,Injury Risk and Performance in Athletes

Methods: From January 2015 to December 2017, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients diagnosed with acute anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury who underwent reconstruction within 90 days of injury. Diagnosis of the Segond fracture was determined either by magnetic resonance imaging or plain radiographs. Factors examined were: age at surgery, sex, body mass index (kg/m2), status of menisci, and activities led to ACL injury. After univariate screening, multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Patients were divided into four groups based on the presence of lateral meniscal (LM) and/or medial meniscal (MM) injuries and compared with respect to the occurrence of Segond fractures. Results: A total of 375 patients were included (163 males, 212 females), with mean age 25.8 years old. Among them, 22 of 375 (5.9 %) had a Segond fracture. We identified injured lateral menisci (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 3.029; 95 % Confidence Interval (CI), 1.206–7.609; P = 0.018), intact medial menisci (aOR, 0.229; 95 % CI, 0.065–0.810; P = 0.022), and higher body mass index (aOR, 1.102; 95 % CI, 1.008–1.205; P = 0.034) as factors indicative of the occurrence of Segond fracture. LM injury without MM injury suggested the existence of a Segond fracture. Conclusion: LM injury without a MM injury indicated the occurrence of a Segond fracture.

This study investigated the motives behind engagement in the sport as well as perceived health and wellbeing benefits. A rapid ethnographic methodology was emplo­yed, in which a field researcher, who kept a reflective diary, also conducted semi-structured interviews with 17 swimmers (n = 11 female, n = 6 male, mean age 52.7 years). Five main themes were identified: motives for engagement/continued participation; the uniqueness of OWS experiences; perceived physical and psychological health benefits; blue and green exercise comparisons; and the utility of social interactions. Core motives focused upon nature connectedness; health outcomes; training for performance; cold-water experience; and self-actualisation. The perceived physical and psycho-social benefits reported by participants appeared to be mediated by numerous influences, including: the restorative and stress reducing natural environments; social interactions; personal challenge; and the ‘highs’ of cold-water immersion - and moderated by factors including access issues; extent of social support/networks; perceptions of safety; and levels of competency. Participants also highlighted substantive differences in benefits derived from OWS compared to green exercise alternatives. The study provides useful insights for relevant health practitioners that might inform potential social prescribing initiatives. Facility operators, who manage open water venues such as the one featured in this study, and swimming coaches at these venues, can also better understand how they can tailor services more appropriately to meet participants’ needs, thus enhancing the overall quality of the OWS ‘offer’ and infrastructure. © 2023 The Author(s).

At present, no strong evidence for treatments for people with persistent PCS exists. Our research group developed a novel intervention, “Get going After concussIoN (GAIN)”, that incorporates multiple evidence-based strategies including prescribed exercise, cognitive behavioural therapy, and gradual return to activity advice. In a previous randomised trial, GAIN provided in a hospital setting was effective in reducing symptoms in 15–30-year-olds with PCS 2–6 months post-injury. In the current study, we describe the protocol for a trial designed to test the effectiveness of GAIN in a larger municipality setting. Additionally, we test the intervention within a broader age group and evaluate a broader range of outcomes. The primary hypothesis is that participants allocated to enhanced usual care plus GAIN report a higher reduction in PCS 3 months post-intervention compared to participants allocated to enhanced usual care only. Methods: The study is a stepped-wedge cluster-randomised trial with five clusters. The 8-week interdisciplinary GAIN program will be rolled out to clusters in 3-month intervals. Power calculation yield at least 180 participants to be enrolled. Primary outcome is mean change in PCS measured by the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire from enrolment to 3 months after end of treatment. Secondary outcomes include participation in and satisfaction with everyday activities, labour market attachment and other behavioural measures. Self-reported outcomes are measured at baseline, by end of treatment and at 3, 6, and 18 months after end of treatment. Registry-based outcomes are measured up to 36 months after concussion. Discussion: The trial will provide important information concerning the effectiveness of the GAIN intervention in a municipality setting. Furthermore, it will provide knowledge of possible barriers and facilitators that may be relevant for future implementation of GAIN in different settings. Trial registration: The current GAIN trial is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (study identifier: NCT04798885) on 20 October 2020. © 2022, The Author(s).",Activities of daily living; Behavioural therapy; Brain concussion; mTBI; Return to work; The Rivermead Post-Concussion Questionnaire,Adult; Brain Concussion; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; Humans; Post-Concussion Syndrome; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Self Report; adult; age distribution; Article; controlled study; get going after concussion; human; job market; major clinical study; neurorehabilitation; patient participation; patient satisfaction; postconcussion syndrome; randomized controlled trial; Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire; self report; therapy effect; treatment outcome; brain concussion; cognitive behavioral therapy; postconcussion syndrome; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic),"""Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion: Studies on Impacts, Recovery, and Influences""",Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion Studies in Young Athletes,Post-Concussion Symptoms and Recovery in Adolescents

However, there are few studies on the association between lifestyle factors and FM, thus we examine the risk of self-reported fibromyalgia given selected lifestyle factors. Methods: We used data from 75,485 participants in the Norwegian Women and Cancer study. Information on FM and the lifestyle factors body mass index (BMI), physical activity level, smoking status/intensity, and alcohol consumption were obtained from baseline and follow-up questionnaires. We used Cox proportional hazards model to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: After a median follow-up time of 10 years, we observed 2,248 cases of self-reported fibromyalgia. Overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m2) and obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) women had a relative risk of 1.34 (95% CI 1.21–1.47) and 1.62 (95% CI 1.41–1.87), respectively, compared to women with normal weight (BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m2). Very low physical activity level (1–2) was associated with a 31% higher risk of self-reported fibromyalgia (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.09–1.57) when compared to moderate physical activity level (5–6). There was a strong dose-response relationship between smoking status/intensity and self-reported fibromyalgia (p for trend < 0.001). Compared with moderate alcohol consumption (4.0–10 g/day), the risk of self-reported FM was 72% (HR 1.72; 95% CI 1.45–2.03) higher among teetotallers, and 38% (HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.23–1.54) higher among those with low consumption (0.1–3.9 g/day).

Design: A secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial of a physical activity behavioural intervention (#NCT03111030). Setting: General community. Participants: Adults with chronic SCI (n = 14). Intervention: An introductory behavioural coaching session followed by eight, weekly follow-up sessions were delivered in-person or by phone/video call. The interventionist utilized behaviour-change techniques tailored to individual participants’ readiness for change, barriers, and preferences. Participants set goals for achieving the SCI exercise guidelines. Coaching sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Main outcome measure(s): Changes over time in the number of barriers reported within each level of a social-ecological model of influences on physical activity (intrapersonal, interpersonal, institutional, community, policy). Results: A total of 152 physical activity barriers were identified across 122 coaching sessions. Within each level of influence, the number of identified barriers decreased significantly over the intervention period. Intrapersonal barriers (e.g., lack of motivation, low self-efficacy) were most frequently reported and showed the greatest reductions over time. Conclusions: Using a new coding method to track changes in physical activity barriers, this pilot project showed a significant decrease in barriers over the course of a counselling intervention. Understanding physical activity barrier dynamics can improve the design of physical activity-enhancing interventions. Dynamic barrier-tracking methods could also be used to improve intervention implementation and evaluation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to International Spinal Cord Society.",,Adult; Exercise; Exercise Therapy; Humans; Motivation; Pilot Projects; Spinal Cord Injuries; adult; Article; attitude to health; audio recording; behavior change; clinical article; counseling; emotion; employment status; female; health belief; health care policy; human; male; medication compliance; mobile application; motivation; outcome assessment; physical activity; quadriplegia; randomized controlled trial (topic); secondary analysis; self concept; social support; spinal cord injury; videorecording; controlled study; exercise; kinesiotherapy; physiology; pilot study; procedures; randomized controlled trial,"""Physical Activity and Rehabilitation in Adults with Neurological Conditions""",Physical Activity and Rehabilitation Post-Injury,Physical Activity Engagement Barriers and Facilitators for Stroke Survivors

We developed the first mind-body activity program (Active Brains [AB]) tailored to the needs of older adults with chronic pain and early cognitive decline. Results from our previous study strongly supported the feasibility of conducting AB remotely and provided evidence for improvements in outcomes. Objective: We are conducting a single-blinded, National Institutes of Health stage-2, randomized clinical trial to establish the efficacy of AB versus a time-matched and dose-matched education control (Health Enhancement Program [HEP]) in improving self-reported and objective outcomes of physical, cognitive, and emotional functions in 260 participants. The methodology described in this paper was informed by the lessons learned from the first year of the trial. Methods: Participants are identified and recruited through multidisciplinary clinician-referred individuals (eg, pain psychologists and geriatricians), the Rally Research platform, social media, and community partnerships. Interested participants complete eligibility screening and electronic informed consent. Baseline assessments include self-report, performance-based measures (eg, 6-min walk test) and objective measures (eg, Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status). Participants are mailed a wrist-worn ActiGraph device (ActiGraph LLC) to passively monitor objective function (eg, steps) during the week between the baseline assessment and the beginning of the programs, which they continue to wear throughout the programs. After baseline assessments, participants are randomized to either AB or HEP and complete 8 weekly, remote, group sessions with a Massachusetts General Hospital psychologist. The AB group receives a Fitbit (Fitbit Inc) to help reinforce increased activity. Assessments are repeated after the intervention and at the 6-month follow-up. Coprimary outcomes include multimodal physical function (self-report, performance based, and objective). Secondary outcomes are cognitive function (self-report and objective), emotional function, and pain. Results: We began recruitment in July 2022 and recruited 37 participants across 4 cohorts. Of them, all (n=37, 100%) have completed the baseline assessment, 26 (70%) have completed the posttest assessment, and 9 (24%) are actively enrolled in the intervention (total dropout: n=2, 5%). In the three cohorts (26/37, 70%) that have completed the AB or HEP, 26 (100%) participants completed all 8 group sessions (including minimal makeups), and watch adherence (1937/2072, 93.48%, average across ActiGraph and Fitbit devices) has been excellent. The fourth cohort is ongoing (9/37, 24%), and we plan to complete enrollment by March 2026. Conclusions: We aim to establish the efficacy of the AB program over a time-matched and dose-matched control in a live video-based trial and test the mechanisms through theoretically driven mediators and moderators. Findings will inform the development of a future multisite effectiveness-implementation trial. © Ana-Maria Vranceanu, Nathaniel R Choukas, Elizabeth A Rochon, Brooke Duarte, Malvina O Pietrzykowski, Katherine McDermott, Julia E Hooker, Ronald Kulich, Yakeel T Quiroz, Robert A Parker, Eric A Macklin, Christine Ritchie, The Active Brains Project, Ryan A Mace.",aged; chronic pain; cognitive decline; mind-body therapies; mobile phone; physical activity; randomized clinical trial; telemedicine,,"""Pain Management and Musculoskeletal Health in Various Populations""",Chronic Pain Management and Treatment Studies,Exercise and Cognitive Function in Aging Adults

However, there is a need to develop validated short-form PROM instruments to decrease patient burden and ease incorporation into clinical practice. Purpose: To assess the validity and responsiveness of a shortened version of the Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (Short-WOSI) when compared with the full WOSI and other shoulder-related PROM instruments. Study Design: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2. Methods: This study was a secondary analysis of data collected as part of an institutional review board–approved, multicenter cohort of 1160 patients undergoing surgical stabilization for shoulder instability. The following PROMs were captured preoperatively and 2 years after surgery: WOSI, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, the Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE), and 36-Item Health Survey (RAND-36). The cohort was split into 2 data sets: a training set to be used in the development of the Short-WOSI (n = 580) and a test set to be used to assess the validity and responsiveness of the Short-WOSI relative to the full WOSI, ASES, SANE, and RAND-36. Results: The Short-WOSI demonstrated excellent internal consistency before surgery (Cronbach α =.83) and excellent internal consistency at the 2-year follow-up (Cronbach α =.93). The baseline, 2-year, and pre- to postoperative changes in Short-WOSI and WOSI were closely correlated (r > 0.90), with both demonstrating large effect sizes (Short-WOSI = 1.92, WOSI = 1.81). Neither the Short-WOSI nor the WOSI correlated well with the other PROM instruments before (r = 0.21-0.33) or after (r = 0.25-0.38) surgery. The Short-WOSI, WOSI, and SANE scores were more responsive than ASES and RAND-36 scores. Conclusion: The 7-item Short-WOSI demonstrated excellent internal consistency and a lack of floor or ceiling effects. The Short-WOSI demonstrated excellent cross-sectional and longitudinal construct validity and was similarly responsive over time as the full WOSI. Neither the Short-WOSI nor WOSI correlated with more general shoulder PROMs, underscoring the advantage of using instability-specific instruments for this population. © 2023 The Author(s).",dislocation; instability; patient-reported outcome; responsiveness; shoulder; validity,,"""Shoulder Joint Health and Rehabilitation: Arthroscopic Surgeries, Treatments and Outcomes""",Clinical Outcomes and Treatments in Shoulder Care,Shoulder Surgery Outcomes and Measures

This study explored patterns and relationships between economic freedom, climate culpability, and Report Card grades on physical activity-related indicators among 57 countries/jurisdictions participating in the Global Matrix 4.0. Methods: Participating countries/ jurisdictions provided Report Card grades on 10 common indicators. Information on economic freedom and climatic factors were gathered from public data sources. Correlations between the key variables were provided by income groups (ie, low- and middle-income countries/jurisdictions and high-income countries/jurisdictions [HIC]). Results: HIC were more economically neoliberal and more responsible for climate change than low- and middle-income countries. Annual temperature and precipitation were negatively correlated with behavioral/individual indicators in low- and middle-income countries but not in HIC. In HIC, correlations between climate culpability and behavioral/individual and economic indicators were more apparent. Overall, poorer grades were observed in highly culpable countries/jurisdictions in the highly free group, while in less/moderately free groups, less culpable countries/jurisdictions showed poorer grades than their counterparts in their respective group by economic freedom. Conclusions: Global-level physical activity promotion strategies should closely evaluate different areas that need interventions tailored by income groups, with careful considerations for inequities in the global political economy and climate change. © 2022 Human Kinetics, Inc.",capitalism; climate change; environment; geopolitics; global governance; global health; health disparities; neoliberalism; SDG; youth,Adolescent; Child; Exercise; Freedom; Humans; Income; Research Report; adolescent; article; capitalism; child; climate change; economic aspect; global health; health disparity; high income country; human; income group; juvenile; middle income country; physical activity; precipitation; exercise; freedom; income; research,"""Physical Activity, Fitness, and Health Studies in Children and Adolescents""",Physical Activity and Its Effects on Health and Well-being in Children and Adolescents,Mental Health and Physical Activity in Times of COVID-19

One of the important muscles involved in forward lunge is biceps femoris. It acts as an agonist muscle during the forward lunging for the knee flexion. Increased hamstring tension causes pelvic alternation, which is another important factor in keeping an upright posture. Primitive Objective of this research is to identify the instant effect of rehabilitative Dynamic oscillatory stretching technique and Contract-Relax (PNF) technique on hamstring flexibility in recreational badminton players, and to perform a comparative analysis the acute effect of rehabilitative Dynamic oscillatory stretching and Contract-Relax (PNF) technique on hamstring flexibility in recreational badminton players. Methods: Quantitative method, quasi-experimental study with a pre-test and post-test design used to estimate the causal influence of the physiotherapeutic intervention. 45 potential participants were volunteered to be involved in this study. Participants were recruited by using the convenience sampling method. Informed consent was acquired from all partakers, and any relevant criteria were mentioned beforehand earlier to the data collection phase. Results: This study results shown, a significant difference of p-value is 0.18 (p>0.05). Hence, the null hypothesis is accepted as there is no statistically significant difference in effectiveness of DOS group and CR PNF group. Conclusion: A few studies been conducted targeting particularly recreational badminton players. Hence, this research carried out to develop a framework of different stretching techniques to help us for making a good training program or warm up regime for recreational badminton players to improve their hamstrings elasticity and minimising the risk of injury. The investigation results showed, both techniques would help in improving hamstring flexibility © 2023, Journal for ReAttach Therapy and Developmental Diversities.All Rights Reserved.",Hamstring pliability; PNF Technique; Recreational Badminton Player; Rehabilitation; Sports Physiotherapy,,"""Balance, Mobility, and Fall Risks in Aging and Musculoskeletal Conditions""",Impact and Control of Chronic Low Back Pain and Balance in Older Adults,Muscle Strength and Recovery in Sports Performance

Setting: A large outpatient medical center specializing in neurological care. Participants, Design, and Main Measures: Passages read aloud by 60 boxers, 40 MMAs, and 55 controls were acoustically analyzed to determine articulation rate (the number of syllables produced per second), number and duration of pauses, and number and duration of disfluencies in this observational study. Results: Both boxers and MMAs differed from controls in articulation rate, producing syllables at a slower rate than controls by nearly half a syllable per second on average. Boxers produced significantly more pauses and disfluencies in passages read aloud than MMAs and controls. Conclusions: Slower articulation rate in both boxers and MMA fighters compared with individuals with no history of RHI and the increased occurrence of pauses and disfluencies in the speech of boxers suggest changes in speech motor behavior that may relate to RHI. These speech characteristics can be measured in everyday speaking conditions and by automatic recognition systems, so they have the potential to serve as effective, noninvasive clinical indicators for RHI-associated neurological decline. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The mental health benefits of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) are well-documented. Few studies have empirically tested the relationship between MVPA and mental health among persons with disabilities. Additionally, theoretically-informed factors that may mediate the relationship are not commonly tested among persons with disabilities. The primary aim of this study was to examine the cross-sectional relationship between MVPA and mental health in adults with disabilities. A secondary aim was to explore the indirect effects of the three psychological needs (autonomy, competence, relatedness) on the MVPA-mental health relationship. Material and methods: Participants (n = 100; mean age = 36.61; 54% women; 84% physical disability) completed an online questionnaire to assess MVPA, mental health, autonomy, competence, and relatedness. The associations between MVPA, psychological needs, and mental health were explored descriptively and in a multiple mediation regression model. Results: The bivariate association between MVPA and mental health was significant (rs = 0.34, p = 0.01), as were the associations between the three psychological needs and MVPA (rs = 0.24–0.43) and mental health (rs = 0.61–0.82). MVPA had a significant indirect effect on mental health through autonomy (β = 0.05, 95% CI = 0.00–0.12), competence (β = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.08–0.25) and relatedness (β = 0.08, 95% CI = 0.02–0.17). Conclusions: The results of this study add to limited research documenting the relationship between MVPA and mental health in adults with disabilities by highlighting the potential benefits of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Future prospective research is needed to investigate the mediating effects of autonomy, competence and relatedness on the relationship between MVPA and mental health in adults with disabilities. © 2022 Sixteenth Century Journal Publishers, Inc.

Methods: Thirty-six New Zealand rabbits were selected and divided into poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PG-Pg) scaffold group, meniscectomy group and sham group. In this study, it was investigated whether PG-Pg scaffold can prevent articular cartilage degeneration and promote tissue degeneration, and its mechanical properties at 3 and 6 months after surgery were also explored. Result: The degree of articular cartilage degeneration was significantly lower in the PG-Pg scaffold group than in the meniscectomy group. The number of chondrocytes increased in the PG-Pg scaffold at 3 and 6 months, while a gradual increase in the mechanical properties of the PG-Pg stent was observed from 6 months. Conclusion: The PG-Pg scaffold slows down the degeneration of articular cartilage, promotes tissue regeneration and improves biomechanical properties after meniscectomy. This novel meniscus scaffold holds promise for enhancing surgical strategies and delivering superior long-term results for individuals with severe meniscus tears.

Previous studies have examined various psychosocial influencing factors (e.g., stress), but have mostly focused on only one or two injury characteristics (e.g., frequency), neglecting the broader injury pattern. Thus, the present study aimed to obtain a more differentiated picture of potentially different injury patterns and related profiles of psychosocial factors. We investigated a sample of 213 athletes from a cross-sectional online study. Current injury status, frequency, severity, chronicity, medical treatment, and rehabilitation measures were subjected to cluster analysis indicating a 3-cluster solution with predominantly chronically injured athletes (n = 54), athletes not seeking treatment (n = 62), and athletes utilizing medical treatment and rehabilitation (n = 97). Building on the Model of Stress and Athletic Injury, we subsequently conducted three multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs) to examine whether the obtained clusters differed in terms of personality factors (e.g., athletic identity), history of stressors (e.g., life events), and coping resources (e.g., self-compassion). We observed significant differences in all three categories of psychosocial variables implying different intervention possibilities for different injury patterns in the future. © 2023 by the authors.",cluster analysis; coping resources; history of stressors; model of stress and athletic injury; personality; self-compassion; sense of coherence; stress,,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Short foot exercise (SFE) and toe curl exercise (TC) are methods used to train the IFMs, but their effect on lower-limb motor control has not been reported in previous studies. This study evaluated the effects of SFE and TC on lower-limb motor control function during single-leg standing (SLS). Trial design: Randomized control trial. Method: Thirty-six participants with flatfoot were randomly assigned to the SFE or TC group and performed exercise for 8 weeks. The assessment items were navicular drop test, toe grip strength (TGS), plantar sensation, and SLS. In the SLS assessment, we measured the mean center of pressure (COP) amplitude in the anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) directions, onset time of gluteus maximus (G. max) and gluteus medius (G. med), angle of forefoot/hindfoot protonation and hip adduction, and lateral pelvic shift. Mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of variance and Bonferroni corrections were performed in statistical analysis. Results: The SFE group showed significant differences between pre- and post-intervention for TGS (p < 0.001), COP ML (p = 0.039), and onset times of G. max (p = 0.015), and G. med (p < 0.001). The TC group showed no significant differences in all assessment items. Conclusion: Our finding suggests that SFE contributes to lower neuromuscular control function in people with flatfoot.

A novel guideline, focused on individualized, goal-focused PRE dosing, professional development, program monitoring, and outcome measures use, facilitated application of a new clinical practice. Conclusions: Practice change was accomplished by translating evidence using a clinical guideline resulting in positive child function and participation outcomes.

To work towards this goal, this study aimed to assess the correlation between lower limb anatomy and back squat performance during a set-to-exhaustion in resistance-trained males and females. Optical motion captures of squat performance and data from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lower limbs were acquired in eight healthy participants (average: 28.4 years, four men, four women). It was hypothesized that there is a correlation between subject-specific musculoskeletal and squat-specific parameters. The results of our study indicate a high correlation between the summed volume of the hamstrings and quadriceps and squat depth normalized to thigh length (r = −0.86), and a high correlation between leg size and one-repetition maximum load (r = 0.81), respectively. Thereby, a marked difference was found in muscle volume and one-repetition maximum load between males and females, with a trend of females squatting deeper. The present study offers new insights for trainers and athletes for targeted musculoskeletal conditioning using the squat exercise. It can be inferred that greater muscle volume is essential to achieving enhanced power potential, and, consequently, a higher 1RM value, especially for female athletes that tend to squat deeper than their male counterparts. © 2023 by the authors.",biomechanics; musculoskeletal anatomy; resistance training; velocity-based training,,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Gender Differences in Musculoskeletal Health & Physical Fitness

Furthermore, lower-body SIE is not feasible for all adults. We compared physiological and perceptual responses to supramaximal, but “non-all-out” SIE between leg and arm cycling exercise. Twenty-four active adults (mean ​± ​SD age: [25 ​± ​7] y; cycling V˙O2max: [39 ​± ​7] mL·kg−1·min−1) performed incremental exercise using leg (LCE) and arm cycle ergometry (ACE) to determine V˙O2max and maximal work capacity (Wmax). Subsequently, they performed four 20 ​s bouts of SIE at 130% Wmax on the LCE or ACE at cadence ​= ​120–130 ​rev/min, with 2 ​min recovery between intervals. Gas exchange data, heart rate (HR), blood lactate concentration (BLa), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), and affective valence were acquired. Data showed significantly lower (p ​< ​0.001) absolute mean ([1.24 ​± ​0.31] L·min−1 vs. [1.59 ​± ​0.34] L·min−1; d ​= ​1.08) and peak V˙O2 ([1.79 ​± ​0.48] L·min−1 vs. [2.10 ​± ​0.44] L·min−1; d ​= ​0.70) with ACE versus LCE. However, ACE elicited significantly higher (p ​< ​0.001) relative mean ([62% ​± ​9%] V˙O2max vs. [57% ​± ​7%] V˙O2max, d ​= ​0.63) and peak V˙O2 ([88% ​± ​10%] V˙O2max vs. [75% ​± ​10%] V˙O2max, d ​= ​1.33). Post-exercise BLa was significantly higher ([7.0 ​± ​1.7] mM vs. [5.7 ​± ​1.5] mM, p ​= ​0.024, d ​= ​0.83) for LCE versus ACE. There was no significant effect of modality on RPE or affective valence (p ​> ​0.42), and lowest affective valence recorded (2.0 ​± ​1.8) was considered “good to fairly good”.

Improvement in the HSI (p =.021) and SF-36 general health (GH) subscales at the third month after treatment in the prolotherapy group was significantly better at the first and third months compared to the other groups (p =.033 and p <.01). No complications were observed in any of the patients. Our study results suggest that prolotherapy, phonophoresis, and steroid injection are beneficial as safe treatment modalities in the early period of PF treatment. The improvement of HSI and SF-36 GH subscale lasts longer with prolotherapy, but ultrasonographic findings do not change in the third month of these treatment applications. © 2023 the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons",1; phonophoresis; plantar fasciitis; prolotherapy; ultrasonography,Article; clinical effectiveness; clinical evaluation; clinical feature; clinical outcome; controlled study; corticosteroid therapy; double blind procedure; female; general health status assessment; human; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; patient safety; plantar fasciitis; prolotherapy; randomized controlled trial; Short Form 36; ultrasound; visual analog scale,Advancements in Therapies and Technologies for Osteoarthritis and Joint Disorders,Therapeutic Interventions and Their Efficacy in Osteoarthritis Treatment,Efficacy and Safety of Different Treatments for Osteoarthritis

Methods: From September 2018 to December 2021, patients with AGI and ≤20% GBL were enrolled in a prospective study on DAS and followed for a minimum of 1 year. The primary outcomes were Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index, Rowe score, range of motion, and strength. The secondary outcomes were ability to return to play (RTP), RTP at same level, lack of recurrence of instability, successful LHB healing, and lack of complications. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure GBL, Hill–Sachs interval, glenoid track, and assess LHB integrity. Results: Eighteen consecutive patients underwent DAS. Fifteen patients had a minimum follow-up of 12 months (mean, 23.93 ± 13.67 months). In total, 12 were male and 3 female patients; 73.3% practiced recreational sports; mean age at surgery was 23.40 ± 6.53 years; mean number of dislocation episodes were 10.13 ± 8.42; mean GBL was 8.21 ± 7.39% (range, 0-20.24%); mean Hill–Sachs interval was 15.00 ± 2.96 mm; and mean glenoid track was 18.87 ± 2.57mm. The mean improvement in the Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index and Rowe score (959.27 ± 386.70 and 74.00 ± 22.22 points) was significant (P < .001 and P < .001) and more than 6 times greater than the minimum clinically important difference. The mean improvement in active elevation, abduction, and external and internal rotation (23.00 ± 27.76°, 33.33 ± 43.78°, 8.33 ± 13.58°, and 0.73 ± 1.28 points) was significant (P = .006, P = .011, P = .032, and P = .044). RTP rate was 93.33%. RTP at same level was 60.00%. One patient with hyperlaxity had a redislocation (6.7% recurrence). No complications were reported. Each magnetic resonance imaging scan showed successful LHB healing to the anterior glenoid. Conclusions: At a minimum of 1-year follow-up, DAS produces significant and clinically important improvements in shoulder function, successful LHB healing, and is safe for the treatment of AGI with ≤20% GBL without severe hyperlaxity.

Recently developed point-of-care test devices would enable BBMs to be measured in field settings such military and sport environments within minutes of a suspicious head hit. However, head hits in these environments typically occur in the setting of vigorous physical exertion, which can itself increase BBMs levels. Thus, efforts to develop BBMs as acute concussion aids in field settings need to account for the effects of physical exertion. To determine the acute effects of physical exertion on the BBMs, we measured GFAP, UCH-L1, tau, and neurofilament light chain (NF-L) immediately before, immediately after, and 45 min after a single workout session consisting of aerobic and resistance exercises in 30 collegiate football players. Subjects wore body sensors measuring several aspects of exertion and underwent diffusion tensor imaging 24 h before and 48 h after exertion. All subjects were male with a mean age of 19.5 ± 1.2 years. The mean duration of activity during the workout session was 94 ± 31 min. There was a significant decrease in serum GFAP immediately after (median decrease of 27.76%, p < 0.0001) and a significant increase in serum UCH-L1 45 min after (median increase of 37.11%, p = 0.016) exertion, compared with pre-exertion baseline. No significant changes in tau or NF-L were identified. The duration of exertion had a significant independent linear correlation to the increase in serum UCHL1 from pre-exertion to 45 min after exertion (r = 0.68, p = 0.004). There were no significant pre-to post-exertional changes in any of the 39 examined brain white matter regions, and biomarker changes did not correlate to variation in white matter integrity in any of these regions. Thus, exertion appeared to be associated with immediate decreases in serum GFAP and very acute (45 min) increases in UCH-L1. These changes were related to the duration of exertion, but not to changes in brain white matter integrity. Our results have important implications for how these BBMs might be used to aid in the on-scene diagnosis of concussion occurring in the setting of physical exertion.  © Copyright 2023, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2023.",brain biomarkers; concussion; glial fibrillary acidic protein; physical exertion; point of care test; ubiquitin carboxy-Terminal hydrolase L1,Adolescent; Adult; Biomarkers; Brain; Brain Concussion; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Female; Football; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; Humans; Male; Physical Exertion; Point-of-Care Systems; Ubiquitin Thiolesterase; Young Adult; biological marker; blood based brain biomarker; glial fibrillary acidic protein; tau protein; ubiquitin thiolesterase; unclassified drug; biological marker; adult; aerobic exercise; Article; blood analysis; body mass; clinical article; concussion; diffusion tensor imaging; echo planar imaging; energy expenditure; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; ethnicity; exercise; football; football player; fractional anisotropy; human; light chain; male; neurofilament; neuroimaging; race; resistance training; white matter; young adult; adolescent; brain; brain concussion; diagnostic imaging; exercise; female; football; point of care system,"""Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion: Studies on Impacts, Recovery, and Influences""",Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion Studies in Young Athletes,"Concussion in Sports: Detection, Effects, and Management"

The seated medicine ball throw (SMBT) is an upper body performance test used to monitor muscle function among older individuals. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the validity and test-retest reliability of the SMBT in older women. Thirty-five women (age = 75.15 ± 6.39 years) participated in this study. Subjects performed SMBT trials using common ball masses (SMBT4lband SMBT3kg) over 3 sessions. Familiarization with the SMBT and chest press 1 repetition maximum (CP1RM) was provided on the first day. On day 2, subjects repeated the tests, but data were recorded. On day 3, SMBT was retested followed by an evaluation of chest press peak power (CPPP) values at 30-80% of CP1RM. Significant correlations (p ≤ 0.05) were found between the CPPPand SMBT4lb(r = 0.775, p < 0.001) and SMBT3kg(r = 0.734, p < 0.001), and SMBT distance showed expected declines with age (r = -0.724 to -0.626, p < 0.001), demonstrating its validity. High reliability between testing days was found, and Bland-Altman plots showed few points that fell outside the limits of agreement. In conclusion, the SMBT is a valid and highly reliable tool that can be used by health professionals to monitor deficits in upper body muscular power to improve treatment protocols in older women. © 2023 NSCA National Strength and Conditioning Association.

We therefore assessed the effect of 12 weeks of resistance training on brain metabolism in older adults (age range: 60–80 years). Participants either underwent two times weekly resistance training program which consisted of four lower body exercises performed for 3 sets of 6–10 repetitions at 70–85% of 1 repetition maximum (n = 20) or served as the passive control group (n = 21). The study used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy to quantify the ratio of total N-acetyl aspartate, total choline, glutamate-glutamine complex, and myo-inositol relative to total creatine (tNAA/tCr, tCho/tCr, Glx/tCr, and mIns/tCr respectively) in the hippocampus (HPC), sensorimotor (SM1), and prefrontal (dlPFC) cortices. The peak torque (PT at 60°/s) of knee extension and flexion was assessed using an isokinetic dynamometer. We used repeated measures time × group ANOVA to assess time and group differences and correlation coefficient analyses to examine the pre-to-post change (∆) associations between PT and neurometabolite variables. The control group showed significant declines in tNAA/tCr and Glx/tCr of SM1, and tNAA/tCr of dlPFC after 12 weeks, which were not seen in the experimental group. A significant positive correlation was found between ∆PT knee extension and ∆SM1 Glx/tCr, ∆dlPFC Glx/tCr and between ∆PT knee flexion and ∆dlPFC mIns/tCr in the experimental group. Overall, findings suggest that resistance training seems to elicit alterations in various neurometabolites that correspond to exercise-induced “preservation” of brain health, while simultaneously having its beneficial effect on augmenting muscle functional characteristics in older adults. © 2023, The Author(s).",Aging; Brain metabolism; Glutamate; N-acetylaspartate; Neurogenesis; Sarcopenia; Strength training,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Brain; Glutamic Acid; Glutamine; Humans; Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell; Resistance Training; biological marker; choline; creatine; glutamic acid; glutamine; inositol; n acetylaspartic acid; glutamic acid; glutamine; lymphocyte antigen receptor; adult; aged; Article; brain metabolism; clinical article; controlled study; correlation analysis; cycling; cytokine production; dementia; disease association; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; dynamometry; exploratory research; fat free mass; female; grip strength; high intensity exercise; hippocampus; human; image analysis; image processing; incidence; international physical activity questionnaire short form; isokinetic exercise; knee function; left hemisphere; low intensity exercise; male; moderate intensity exercise; Montreal cognitive assessment; muscle strength; nerve cell plasticity; neurochemistry; neuroimaging; physical activity; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; randomized controlled trial; resistance training; right hemisphere; sensorimotor cortex; signal noise ratio; T1 weighted imaging; three-dimensional imaging; brain; metabolism; very elderly","""Cognitive Decline Prevention and Improvement through Exercise and Therapeutic Interventions""",Exercise Interventions and Cognitive Function in Older Adults,Exercise and Cognitive Function in Aging Adults

OBJECTIVES To investigate the association between cumulative MVPA (cMVPA) over 2 weeks and subsequent symptom burden at 1week, 2weeks, and 4weeks postinjury in children and examine the association between cMVPA and odds of persisting symptoms after concussion (PSAC) at 2 weeks and 4 weeks postinjury. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This multicenter cohort study used data from a randomized clinical trial that was conducted from March 2017 to December 2019 at 3 Canadian pediatric emergency departments in participants aged 10.00 to 17.99 years with acute concussion of less than 48 hours. Data were analyzed from July 2022 to December 2023. EXPOSURE cMVPA postinjury was measured with accelerometers worn on the waist for 24 hours per day for 13 days postinjury, with measurements deemed valid if participants had 4 or more days of accelerometer data and 3 or fewer consecutive days of missing data. cMVPA at 1 week and 2 weeks postinjury was defined as cMVPA for 7 days and 13 days postinjury, respectively. Multiple imputations were carried out on missing MVPA days. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Self-reported postconcussion symptom burden at 1 week, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks postinjury using the Health and Behavior Inventory (HBI). PSAC was defined as reliable change on the HBI. A linear mixed-effect model was used for symptom burden at 1 week, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks postinjury with a time × cMVPA interaction. Logistic regressions assessed the association between cMVPA and PSAC. All models were adjusted for prognostically important variables. RESULTS In this study, 267 of 456 children (119 [44.6%] female; median [IQR] age, 12.9 [11.5 to 14.4] years) were included in the analysis. Participants with greater cMVPA had significantly lower HBI scores at 1 week (75th percentile [258.5 minutes] vs 25th percentile [90.0 minutes]; difference, -5.45 [95%CI, -7.67 to -3.24]) and 2 weeks postinjury (75th percentile [565.0 minutes] vs 25th percentile [237.0 minutes]; difference, -2.85 [95%CI, -4.74 to -0.97]) but not at 4 weeks postinjury (75th percentile [565.0 minutes] vs 25th percentile [237.0 minutes]; difference, -1.24 [95%CI, -3.13 to 0.64]) (P = .20). Symptom burden was not lower beyond the 75th percentile for cMVPA at 1 week or 2weeks postinjury (1week, 259 minutes; 2weeks, 565 minutes) of cMVPA. The odds ratio for the association between 75th and 25th percentile of cMVPA and PSAC was 0.48 (95%CI, 0.24 to 0.94) at 2 weeks. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In children and adolescents with acute concussion, 259 minutes of cMVPA during the first week postinjury and 565 minutes of cMVPA during the second week postinjury were associated with lower symptom burden at 1 week and 2 weeks postinjury. At 2 weeks postinjury, higher cMVPA volume was associated with 48%reduced odds of PSAC compared with lower cMVPA volume.  © 2024 Ledoux AA et al.",,Adolescent; Brain Concussion; Canada; Child; Cohort Studies; Exercise; Female; Humans; Linear Models; Male; adolescent; anterograde amnesia; Article; child; cohort analysis; data processing; emergency ward; female; human; locally estimated scatterplot smoothing; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; physical activity; postconcussion syndrome; prospective study; symptom burden; brain concussion; Canada; clinical trial; controlled study; epidemiology; exercise; randomized controlled trial; statistical model,"""Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion: Studies on Impacts, Recovery, and Influences""",Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion Studies in Young Athletes,Post-Concussion Symptoms and Recovery in Adolescents

With an increasing number of surgeries, complications such as lower limb edema, pain, and limited mobility have caused a heavy burden. Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) may be a solution to solve the problem. The study aims to evaluate the efficacy of MLD in reducing knee edema, pain, and improving range of motion (ROM) in patients after TKR. Methods: A search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI, VIPs, WanFang database, and Google Scholar from inception to June 2023. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effects of MLD and non-MLD (or another physiotherapy) on improving knee edema, pain, and ROM after TKR were included. Stata 16.0 was used for meta-analysis. GRADE was used to assess the quality of evidence. Results: In total, 7 RCTs with 285 patients were identified. There were no significant differences found in the ROM of knee flexion (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.03, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.22, 0.28, P = 0.812) and the ROM of knee extension (SMD= -0.30, 95%CI: -0.64, 0.04, P = 0.084). No differences were observed in the lower extremity circumference after TKR (SMD= -0.09, 95%CI: -0.27, 0.09, P = 0.324). For postoperative pain, there was no significant advantage between the MLD and non-MLD groups (SMD= -0.33, 95%CI: -0.71, 0.04, P = 0.083). Conclusions: Based on the current evidence from RCTs, manual lymphatic drainage is not recommended for the rehabilitation of patients following total knee replacement. © 2023, The Author(s).",Edema; Manual lymphatic drainage; Pain; Range of motion; Total knee replacement,"Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Edema; Humans; Manual Lymphatic Drainage; Pain, Postoperative; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Article; edema; human; intermethod comparison; knee edema; knee pain; manual lymphatic drainage; meta analysis; physiotherapy; postoperative pain; randomized controlled trial (topic); range of motion; systematic review (topic); total knee arthroplasty; edema; knee replacement; manual lymphatic drainage; rehabilitation","""Application of Machine Learning and Biomechanics in Musculoskeletal Health and Wearable Devices""","Knee Assessment and Recovery: Validity, Reliability, and Clinical Trials",Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Non-pharmacologic interventions have received increasing attention as potential strategies to alleviate chronic low back pain and improve patient outcomes. The aim of this systematic review was to comprehensively assess the changes in blood inflammatory biomarkers after non-pharmacologic interventions for CLBP patients, thus trying to understand the complex interactions between non-pharmacologic interventions and inflammatory biomarker changes in CLBP. Methods: A thorough search (from January 1st, 2002 to October 5th, 2022) of PubMed, Medline (platform Web of Science), and the Cochrane Library (platform Wiley Online Library) were conducted, and inclusion criteria as well as exclusion criteria were refined to selection of the studies. Rigorous assessments of study quality were performed using RoB 2 from Cochrane or an adaptation of the Downs and Black checklist. Data synthesis includes alterations in inflammatory biomarkers after various non-pharmacologic interventions, including exercise, acupressure, neuro-emotional technique, and other modalities. Results: Thirteen primary studies were included in this systematic review, eight randomized controlled trials, one quasi-randomized trial, and four before-after studies. The interventions studied consisted of osteopathic manual treatment (one study), spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) (three studies), exercise (two studies), yoga (two studies) and acupressure (two studies), neuro-emotional technique (one study), mindfulness-based (one study) and balneotherapy study (one study). Four studies reported some changes in the inflammatory biomarkers compared to the control group.

Decreased interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-10, and c-reactive protein (CRP) after NET, and increased IL-4 after acupressure. Another five studies found changes in inflammatory biomarkers through pre- and post-intervention comparisons, indicating improvement outcomes after intervention. Increased IL-10 after balneotherapy; decreased TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-8, Interferon-gamma, interferon-γ-induced protein 10-γ-induced protein 10 after exercise; decreased IL-6 after exercise and SMT; decreased CRP and chemokine ligand 3 after SMT. Conclusion: Results suggest a moderation of inflammatory biomarkers due to different non-pharmacologic interventions for CLBP, generally resulting in decreased pro-inflammatory markers such as TNF-α and IL-6 as well as increased anti-inflammatory markers such as IL-4, thus revealing the inhibition of inflammatory processes by different non-pharmacologic interventions. However, a limited number of high-quality studies evaluating similar interventions and similar biomarkers limits the conclusion of this review. © The Author(s) 2024.",Anti-inflammatory cytokines; Interleukin; Pain management; Pro-inflammatory cytokines; Tumor necrosis factor alpha,Biomarkers; Chronic Pain; Humans; Interferon-gamma; Interleukin-10; Interleukin-4; Interleukin-6; Low Back Pain; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; biological marker; C reactive protein; CXCL3 chemokine; gamma interferon; interleukin 1; interleukin 10; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 2; interleukin 4; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha; macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; tumor necrosis factor; biological marker; gamma interferon; interleukin 10; interleukin 4; interleukin 6; tumor necrosis factor; ablation therapy; acupressure; Article; balneotherapy; exercise; health care system; human; ICD-10; ICD-11; inflammation; low back pain; medical procedures; mindfulness; neuroemotional technique; quality control; randomized controlled trial (topic); risk assessment; systematic review; treatment outcome; wellbeing; yoga; chronic pain; low back pain,"""Balance, Mobility, and Fall Risks in Aging and Musculoskeletal Conditions""",Impact and Control of Chronic Low Back Pain and Balance in Older Adults,Management and Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

However, the effect of fESWT on central nervous system is still to be determined. Objective: To elucidate spinal and supra-spinal mechanisms of fESWT in healthy subjects, in order to widen the spectrum of its clinical applications. Methods: In this quasi-experimental, unblinded, proof-of-concept clinical study, 10 voluntary healthy subjects underwent fESWT and were assessed immediately before (T0), immediately after (T1) and seven days after (T2) the intervention. As neurophysiological outcomes, motor evoked potentials (resting motor threshold, maximal motor evoked potential and maximal compound muscle action potential ratio, cortical silent period, total conduction motor time, direct and indirect central motor conduction time), F-waves (minimal and mean latency, persistence and temporal dispersion) and H-reflex (threshold, amplitude, maximal H reflex and maximal compound muscle action potential ratio, latency) were considered. Results: Resting motor threshold and F-waves temporal dispersion significantly decreased, respectively, from T1 and T2 and from T0 and T2 (for both, p < 0.05). H-reflex threshold increase between T0 and T1. Analysis disclosed a strong negative correlation between ∆3 cortical silent period (i.e., T2 – T1 recordings) and ∆1 Hr threshold (i.e., T1 – T0 recordings) (r = –0.66, p < 0.05), and a positive strong relationship between ∆3 cortical silent period and ∆3 Hr threshold (r = 0.63, p < 0.05). Conclusions: fESWT modulates corticospinal tract excitability in healthy volunteers, possibly inducing an early inhibition followed by a later facilitation after one week. © 2023 – IOS Press.

Yet, many adults live sedentary lifestyles, especially during their workday. The current study applies an extended theory of planned behavior model, incorporating affective attitudes and instrumental attitudes, along with habit, to predict limiting sedentary behavior and physical activity within an office environment. Theory of planned behavior constructs and habit were assessed with an online survey on a sample of 180 full-time office workers, with self-reported behavior assessed 1 week later (Mage = 25.97, SDage = 10.24; 44 males, 134 females, and 2 nonbinary). Model fit was indicated by BRMSEA (M = 0.057, SD = 0.023), B γ^ (M = 0.984, SD = 0.010) and BCFI (M = 0.959, SD = 0.026), accounting for 46.1% of variance in intention, 21.6% of variance in sedentary behavior, and 17.4% of variance in physical activity behavior. A Bayesian structural equation model revealed direct effects of instrumental attitudes and perceived behavioral control on intention to limit sedentary behavior, direct effects of intention and perceived behavioral control on limiting sedentary behavior, and direct effects of perceived behavioral control and habit on engaging in physical activity. The current study indicates intentions to be active in the office are primarily driven by beliefs about the benefits of activity and individuals' perceived level of control, rather than normative or affective beliefs. As behavior was predicted by both intention and habit, findings also indicate office-based activity is likely not always a consciously driven decision. These findings may have implications for improving activity levels in this highly sedentary population. © 2023 The Authors.

The use of dual tasks during training can improve different abilities. Therefore, the objective of this study is creating a protocol, based on standard protocol items recommendations for interventional trials compliant, for a clinical trial study conduct, review, reporting, and interpretation. This protocol will provide the framework and a guide to a randomized double-blind study, that will be conducted to assess the influence of a cycling exercise program combined with a cognitive task, on cognitive and physical Parkinson disease aspects. Methods: Designed a protocol for a double-blind randomized study, where participants will perform a dual tasks intervention with cycling and a cognitive task. The revised version of the unified Parkinson disease rating scale, the Parkinson disease questionnaire, the timed up and go Test, the 30 seconds chair sit to stand test, the Stroop and the trail making test will be used to measure outcomes. Discussion: Research in Parkinson disease suggests that an improvement of motor and cognitive functions of Parkinson disease patients can be achieved by modifying different motor and cognitive pathways. The results of the present study will yield findings on both the physical and cognitive response to an intervention that combines a cognitive task with a motor task in Parkinson disease patients and will be essential tool for a better conducting of the clinical trial study.  © 2022 the Author(s).

The clinical effect of myofascial cupping on pain and function is not clear, especially when different cupping techniques are combined. The purpose of this case series was to explore changes in pain and function following local static and distal dynamic myofascial dry cupping treatments in patients with chronic low back pain. Case Descriptions Three adults from the general population received three ten-minute treatment sessions, 48 hours between each session, of static dry cupping to the low back followed by dynamic myofascial cupping of the quadriceps and hamstring musculature. Outcome measures were taken at two different time points within one-week per participant. Subjective measures included the numeric pain rating scale and the Oswestry Disability Index, objective measures included passive straight leg raise measurements, and pressure pain threshold. Results and Discussion Local static combined with distal dynamic myofascial cupping reduced pain, pain sensitivity and perceived disability, and improved hamstring muscle extensibility in all three participants. These encouraging results support the initiation of a larger controlled trial aimed at investigating the efficacy of combined dry cupping interventions to treat musculoskeletal dysfunction and pain.

To investigate the effects of an early neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) protocol on muscle quality and size as well as signaling mediators of muscle growth and systemic inflammation in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Design. Two-arm, single-blinded, parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial with a blinded assessment. Setting. Trauma intensive care unit at a university hospital. Participants. Forty consecutive patients on mechanical ventilation (MV) secondary to TBI were prospectively recruited within the first 24 hours following admission. Interventions. The intervention group (NMES; n = 20) received a daily session of NMES on the rectus femoris muscle for five consecutive days (55 min/each session). The control group (n = 20) received usual care. Main Outcome Measures. Muscle echogenicity and thickness were evaluated by ultrasonography. A daily blood sample was collected to assess circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), inflammatory cytokines, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP). Results. Both groups were similar at baseline. A smaller change in muscle echogenicity and thickness (difference between Day 1 and Day 7) was found in the control group compared to the NMES group (29.9 ± 2.1 vs. 3.0 ± 1.2, p<0.001; -0.79 ± 0.12 vs. -0.01 ± 0.06, p<0.001, respectively). Circulating levels of IGF-I, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-y), and MMP were similar between groups. Conclusion. An early NMES protocol can preserve muscle size and quality and maintain systemic levels of signaling mediators of muscle growth and inflammation in patients with TBI.

METHODS: The manuscript presents theoretical analysis of special scientific and methodological literature, anthropometric and pedagogical methods and methods of mathematical statistics. The physical fitness profile of the middle-aged overweight and obese women was assessed by factor analysis. RESULTS: The pilot feasibility study involving women with an average age of 37.2 years (N.=55) was designed to explore the possibility of remote implementation of primary and ongoing measurement for main anthropometric indicators characterizing excessive body weight. The cross-sectional study involving overweight and obese women (via the Body Mass Index [BMI] from 25.00 to 32.10 kg/m2) with an average age of 38.9 years (N.=105) explored the data with factor analysis and identified the major factors, which determined the structure of physical condition in middle-aged obese women and selected the most informative criteria for designing self-training exercise programs. These criteria were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the original weight management program delivered via telehealth services for middle-aged overweight women in interventional cohort study (N.=62). Participation in the weight management program resulted in significant changes in the morphofunctional status of the women.

Methods: A systematic review was conducted based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Two independent reviewers searched the PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases using the terms “posterior cruciate ligament” or “PCL” and “remnant preserving.” The outcome measures extracted from the studies were the Lysholm score, the International Knee Documentation Committee’s (IKDC) subjective and objective scores, Tegner scores, Orthopädische Arbeitsgruppe Knie (OAK) rate of return to sports, and rate of complications. Data were also extracted from studies that used stress radiographs to perform a quantitative assessment of the preoperative and postoperative anteroposterior stability. Results: The systematic review included 13 studies. The patient cohort of consisted of 643 participants (544 [84.6%] men and 99 [15.4%] women) with a mean age of 32.9 ± 4.0 years. The mean postoperative follow-up was 34.5 ± 10.9 months (range: 24–96 months), while the mean time from injury to surgery was 14.4 ± 9.9 months (range: 0–240 months). All studies reported clinically significant improvement at final follow-up, as evident from the measured subjective and objective IKDC scores, Lysholm score, Tegner score, and OAK rate. Only three studies reported return to sports activity, with a mean percentage of 90.8% (99/109). All studies showed a significant improvement in posterior translation, from 11.5 ± 1.2 mm to 3.3 ± 1.1 mm, using radiography (side-to-side difference). This systematic review revealed 13 (2.0%) failures and 33 (5.1%) minor complications: 10 (1.6%) cases of stiffness, 21 (4.9%) screws removal, 1 (0.2%) injury of the peroneal nerve, and 1 (0.2%) fibular fracture. Conclusions: With the currently available data, all studies included in the review on posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with remnant preservation demonstrated satisfactory outcomes at mid-term follow-up (> 24 months), despite varying surgical techniques and graft types, and intervals from injury to surgery. For clinical relevance, standard PCL reconstruction is a highly effective operation in terms of improvement in functional status, knee stability, quality of life, and cost effectiveness. The remnant preservation technique requires more comprehensive diagnostic assessments of the PCL remnant patterns and more complicated surgical procedures. Given the absence so far of high quality studies with long-term follow-up, the remnant-preserving techniques should be recommended only by experienced knee arthroscopic surgeons.

Lower limb exoskeletons and exosuits may hold potential for augmenting walking ability. However, it remains unknown whether these wearable robots are safe and beneficial for use outside of highly controlled laboratory environments, the demonstration of which is necessary for clinical translation. Here, we show that a lightweight, portable, ankle exoskeleton with an adaptable one-size-works-for-all assistance controller can improve energy efficiency and walking speed for individuals with CP spanning a wide spectrum of lower limb impairment in a multi-terrain real-world environment. Tested on an outdoor walking route with level, sloped, and stair terrain, robotic assistance resulted in a 15-18% (p = 0.013-0.026) reduction in estimated energy cost and a 7-8% (p = 0.001-0.004) increase in average walking speed across 'shorter' 6-minute and 'longer' 20-minute walking durations relative to unassisted walking.

However, few studies have evaluated temporal changes in the electromyographic activity (EMG) of lower limb muscles during running. The aim of this study was to compare temporal changes in EMG amplitude between RF and FF running techniques. Eleven recreational runners ran on a treadmill at a self-selected speed, once using a RF strike pattern and once using a FF strike pattern (randomized order). The EMG of five lower limb muscles [rectus femoris (RFe), biceps femoris (BF), tibialis anterior (TA), medial and lateral gastrocnemius (MG and LG)] was evaluated, using bipolar electrodes. EMG data from the RF and FF running techniques was then processed and compared with statistical parametric mapping (SPM), dividing the analysis of the running cycle into stance and swing phases. The MG and LG muscles showed higher activation during FF running at the beginning of the stance phase and at the end of the swing phase. During the end of the swing phase, the TA muscle's EMG amplitude was higher, when the RF running technique was used. A higher level of co-activation between the gastrocnemius and TA muscles was observed in both stance and swing phases using RF. The myoelectric behaviour of the RFe and BF muscles was similar during both running techniques. The current findings highlight that the two running techniques predominately reflect adjustments of the shank and not the thigh muscles, in both phases of the running cycle. Highlights Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) can reveal temporal differences in muscle activity between running techniques. The medial and lateral gastrocnemius muscles were more active at specific time-instants of the initial stance and late swing phases during forefoot (FF) running compared to rearfoot (RF) running. Higher activation was observed for the tibialis anterior muscle at the end of the swing phase during RF running Contrary to the muscle activity differences observed in the leg muscles, the muscle activity of the thigh muscles was similar during RF and FF running. © 2022 European College of Sport Science.",running; Statistical parametric mapping; surface electromyography,"Electromyography; Foot; Humans; Leg; Lower Extremity; Muscle, Skeletal; electromyography; foot; human; leg; lower limb; physiology; skeletal muscle",Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Gender Differences in Musculoskeletal Health & Physical Fitness

The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to test if shear wave tensiometry is able to detect AT loading changes between a surgically managed AT rupture versus the unaffected contralateral tendon. Our secondary aims were to evaluate differences in mechanical properties when measured with myotonometry and morphological properties of the tendons measured with ultrasonographic imaging. Methods: Twenty-one patients with surgically treated AT ruptures were investigated 12-37 months after surgery. Tendon load was measured using a shear wave tensiometer composed of an array of 4 accelerometers fixed on the tendon. Shear wave speed along the Achilles tendon was evaluated at different levels of ankle torque for both the operated and the unaffected side. Mechanical properties of the tendons were evaluated using MyotonPRO and morphological properties using ultrasonographic imaging. Friedman test was used to assess differences in AT wave speed, stiffness, thickness, and cross-sectional area between the operated and the unaffected tendon. Results: We found a significant shear wave speed difference between sides at every ankle joint torque (P <.05) with a large effect size for the lowest ankle torque and small to medium effect sizes for higher ankle torque. Stiffness, thickness, and cross-sectional area of the operated tendon remained significantly higher compared to the unaffected side. Conclusion: In this cohort, we found that shear wave tensiometry can detect differences between operated and unaffected AT during a standardized loading procedure. The shear wave speed along the operated tendon, as well as the mechanical and morphologic properties, remains higher for 1-3 years after a rupture.

Gas exchange or blood lactate analysis are usually implemented for this purpose, but these methodologies are expensive and invasive. The short-term scaling exponent alpha 1 of detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA-α1) of the Heart Rate Variability (HRV) has been proposed as a non-invasive methodology to detect intensity thresholds. Purpose: The aim of this study is to analyse the validity of DFA-α1 HRV analysis to determine the individual training thresholds in elite cyclists and to compare them against the lactate thresholds. Methodology: 38 male elite cyclists performed a graded exercise test to determine their individual thresholds. HRV and blood lactate were monitored during the test. The first (LT1 and DFA-α1-0.75, for lactate and HRV, respectively) and second (LT2 and DFA-α1-0.5, for lactate and HRV, respectively) training intensity thresholds were calculated. Then, these points were matched to their respective power output (PO) and heart rate (HR). Results: There were no significant differences (p > 0.05) between the DFA-α1-0.75 and LT1 with significant positive correlations in PO (r = 0.85) and HR (r = 0.66). The DFA-α1-0.5 was different against LT2 in PO (p = 0.04) and HR (p = 0.02), but it showed significant positive correlation in PO (r = 0.93) and HR (r = 0.71). Conclusions: The DFA1-a-0.75 can be used to estimate LT1 non-invasively in elite cyclists. Further research should explore the validity of DFA-α1-0.5. Highlights The power and heart rate values derived from the DFA-α1-0.75 threshold showed high levels of validity and agreement when they were compared against the first lactate threshold. The second lactate threshold and the DFA-α1-0.5 were different (p < 0.05) but showed high levels of correlation. The detrended fluctuation analysis is a valid method to estimate the first lactate threshold and more studies are needed to verify its validity with the second lactate threshold. © 2022 European College of Sport Science.",elite cyclists; heart rate variability; non-linear analysis; Thresholds,Athletes; Exercise Test; Heart Rate; Humans; Lactic Acid; Male; lactic acid; athlete; exercise test; heart rate; human; male; physiology,"""Physical Activity and Health Outcomes in Aging Populations""",Physical Activity and Health in Older Adults,Physiological and Biomechanical Responses in Sports Performance

Performance analysis was conducted for the rally duration and interval and impact of serve, whilst none investigated the shots distribution among classes of physical impairment. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to conduct a notational analysis of international competitions in relation to the wheelchair classes. Five matches for each wheelchair class (C1-to-C5) were evaluated from 20 elite male right-handed players. Both players for each match were analyzed for the following performance indicators: strokes type, the area of ball bouncing, and the shots outcome. Backhand shots were the most used technique for all classes. The most used strokes for C1 players were backhand and forehand drive and backhand lob, while for C5 players they were backhand and forehand push and backhand topspin. Similar shots distribution was registered for C2-to-C5 players. The central and far-from-the-net zone was mainly reached by the serve for all classes. Errors shots were similar in all classes, whilst winning shots were more frequent in C1. The current notational analysis provided a meaningful performance modelling of indicators for coaches and athletes that can be used to design training programs for each class. © 2023 by the authors.",elite table tennis player; match analysis; performance analysis; performance indicators; physical impairment,Athletes; Biomechanical Phenomena; Hand; Humans; Male; Tennis; disability; performance assessment; sport; training; analysis; Article; athletic performance; elite athlete; human; male; notational analysis; paralympic table tennis; physical disease; post hoc analysis; sport; wheelchair athlete; wheelchair sport; athlete; biomechanics; hand; tennis,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

These injuries occur when excessive repetitive loads are introduced to a generally normal skeleton. Although the precise mechanisms for bone stress injuries are not completely understood, the prevailing theory is that an imbalance in bone metabolism favours microdamage accumulation over its removal and replacement with new bone via targeted remodelling. Diagnosis is achieved by a combination of patient history and physical examination, with imaging used for confirmation. Management of bone stress injuries is guided by their location and consequent risk of healing complications. Bone stress injuries at low-risk sites typically heal with activity modification followed by progressive loading and return to activity. Additional treatment approaches include non-weight-bearing immobilization, medications or surgery, but these approaches are usually limited to managing bone stress injuries that occur at high-risk sites. A comprehensive strategy that integrates anatomical, biomechanical and biological risk factors has the potential to improve the understanding of these injuries and aid in their prevention and management. © 2022, Springer Nature Limited.",,"Bone and Bones; Fractures, Stress; Humans; calcium; corticosteroid; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; vitamin D; Article; biomechanics; bone metabolism; electric field; extracorporeal therapy; fracture fixation; fracture healing; fracture immobilization; heredity; human; immobilization; medical history; morbidity; pathophysiology; physical activity; physical examination; quality of life; return to sport; risk factor; screening; shock wave therapy; sleep disorder; stress fracture; training; ultrasound therapy; bone; stress fracture","""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Gender Differences in Musculoskeletal Health & Physical Fitness

Physical activity (PA) reduces CVD morbidity and mortality. We aimed to determine the relationship between the composition of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), light PA (LPA), sedentary behavior (SB), and sleep during midlife to the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and all-cause mortality at a 7-year follow-up. The study population consisted of Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 members who participated in the 46-year follow-up in 2012 and were free of MACE (N = 4147). Time spent in MVPA, LPA, and SB was determined from accelerometer data. Sleep time was self-reported. Hospital visits and deaths were obtained from national registers. Participants were followed until December 31, 2019, or first MACE occurrence (acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, stroke, hospitalization due to heart failure, or death due to CVD), death from another cause, or censoring. Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate hazard ratios of MACE incidence and all-cause mortality. Isotemporal time reallocations were used to demonstrate the dose–response association between time spent in behaviors and outcome. The 24-h time composition was significantly associated with incident MACE and all-cause mortality. More time in MVPA relative to other behaviors was associated with a lower risk of events. Isotemporal time reallocations indicated that the greatest risk reduction occurred when MVPA replaced sleep. Higher MVPA associates with a reduced risk of incident MACE and all-cause mortality after accounting for the 24-h movement composition and confounders. Regular engagement in MVPA should be encouraged in midlife. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The relationship between physiotherapy treatment and patient-reported outcomes following ACLR in New Zealand (NZ) is not clear. We used repeated measures logistic regression to examine the relationship between patient-reported outcome data from the NZ ACL Registry and physiotherapy treatment data from the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC). Outcome measures utilised were the patient acceptable symptom state (PASS) on the Knee Injury Osteoarthritis and Outcome Score (KOOS4) and a normative score on the Marx Activity Rating Scale (MARS) within 24 months of ACLR. Data from 5,345 individuals were included in the final analysis, with a mean (SD) of 11.7 (10.5) (range 0–91) physiotherapy treatments received, over an average (SD) of 185 (153) (range 0–725) days, in the two years following ACLR. Physiotherapy treatment post-ACLR increased the likelihood of achieving a KOOS4 PASS score at 6 and 12 months, but not at 24 months, following surgery. Physiotherapy did not increase the likelihood of achieving a normative MARS score in the 24 months after ACLR. Multiple factors likely contribute to people who have had an ACLR in NZ receiving a low dosage of physiotherapy treatment following surgery. Physiotherapy treatment after ACLR may increase patient acceptance of any post-surgical symptoms and functional limitations, but the effect on post-operative activity levels is less clear. © 2023, Physiotherapy New Zealand.

This study aimed to verify the combined effect of soy peptide supplementation and exercise on cognitive function among community-dwelling older adults in Japan. Methods: In this population-based, non-blinded randomized controlled trial, 72 community-dwelling older adults who were independent in activities of daily living were randomly assigned to an “exercise plus nutrition” program (Ex + Nt group, n = 36) or an exercise program (Ex group, n = 36). For 3 months, both groups participated in an exercise and cognitive training regimen once per week, with the Ex + Nt group receiving soy supplementation once per week. Pre- and post-intervention measurements included grip strength, gait speed, skeletal muscle mass index, and scores on Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised, trail-making test A, and the Geriatric Depression Scale. Participant enrollment for this study started in January 2019 and ended in April 2019. Results: Exercise training increased the skeletal muscle mass index by 2.0% and 3.0% in the Ex + Nt and Ex groups, respectively. The Ex + Nt group exhibited a significant 0.3-point increase in the memory score. Conclusion: A 3-month exercise program combined with soy peptide supplementation may be effective in improving both motor and memory function in community-dwelling older adults. © 2022 The Author(s)",Dietary supplements; Elderly; Memory; Motor function,peptide; soy peptide; unclassified drug; aged; Article; clinical article; cognition; community dwelling person; controlled study; daily life activity; diet supplementation; exercise; female; follow up; functional food; Geriatric Depression Scale; grip strength; human; Japan; male; memory; muscle mass; randomized controlled trial; skeletal muscle; trail making test; walking speed,"""Cognitive Decline Prevention and Improvement through Exercise and Therapeutic Interventions""",Exercise Interventions and Cognitive Function in Older Adults,Exercise and Cognitive Function in Aging Adults

However, research has been mostly limited to aerobic and resistance exercise. Considering that stretching activities are also an important component of physical fitness, this quasi-experimental study was designed to: 1) compare affective responses during and immediately after stretching exercises in apparently healthy adults, and 2) assess the consistency and repeatability of affect ratings obtained one week apart. For this purpose, we analyzed the Feeling Scale (FS) and Felt Arousal Scale (FAS) ratings using Time (during and after stretching) x Intensity (light, moderate, vigorous) x Stretched Muscle Group (quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, latissimus dorsi, triceps) with repeated measures analysis of variance (ANCOVA) in 34 participants (21 males; aged 32.8 ± 8.6 years). The repeatability of FS and FAS ratings was assessed using two-way random-effects models, Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC), and Bland-Altman plots. FS scores were higher following the stretching exercises, whereas FAS scores were lower, particularly in the vigorous intensity. In general, the inter-day repeatability for FS and FAS measurements was good across muscle groups. ICC tended to be higher at vigorous intensities. Ratings of core affect can be collected during static passive stretches using the FAS and FAS in ecologically valid settings. These results suggest that an adequate assessment of core affective responses to stretching activities should be performed during the exercises. © 2023 The Authors",Core affect; Exercise; Feeling scale; Felt arousal scale; Stretching; Valence,adult; analysis of covariance; analysis of variance; arousal; article; clinical article; controlled study; correlation coefficient; exercise; feeling scale; female; hamstring muscle; human; human experiment; latissimus dorsi muscle; male; quadriceps femoris muscle; stretching exercise; triceps brachii muscle,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Physiological and Biomechanical Responses in Sports Performance

As a part of the MC, many females experience a wide range of symptoms related to hormonal fluctuations and menstrual bleeding, including physical pain and mood disturbances. Currently, there is a lack of data on the MCs of females who participate in resistance training. The dearth of information on the regular MC in female athletes may lead to poorly informed training recommendations which may be detrimental for female athletic advancement. The purpose of this survey was to determine the average MC characteristics, hormonal contraceptive (HC) use and perceived effects of the MC on training in resistance-trained athletes, and to determine if there are differences in these variables when comparing recreationally trained women to competitive-level athletes. A survey addressing questions about the MC, HC use and perceived effects of the MC was accessed by 906 participants who self-identified as resistance-trained athletes. Resistance-trained athletes, competitive or not, experience MCs similar to data on other exercising females and the general population. MC symptoms are widespread and, for some, can be quite severe and limiting. Competitive athletes were not more likely to experience MC irregularities than non-competitive females. Nearly half of the participants reported using HCs. Most participants perceived that their MC had a negative effect on their performance and that their MC caused reductions in training load or workout program adherence, although most competitive-level athletes did not withdraw from competitions due to MC symptoms. © The Author(s) 2024.",Female athletes; powerlifting; strength-based sport; weightlifting,,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

PRISM is a salutogenic, integrative, process-based cognitive-behavioral model designed for physical therapist education and practice. PRISM aligns with national and international initiatives to better understand and manage pain, thereby mitigating the global opioid crisis. PRISM aims to address the multidimensional nature of pain while building resilience, nurturing growth, and facilitating pain recovery.

We aimed to assess the impact of psychological well-being on patients who underwent rotator cuff repair. We also investigated correlations and possible predictors between patient demographics and adherence to the use of the shoulder brace and outcomes in terms of shoulder functionality and quality of life. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study with prospective data collection enrolling 120 consecutive patients who underwent shoulder arthroscopy for rotator cuff tear repair. Each patient was clinically evaluated after a mean follow-up of 24.2 (±9.8) months using (1) the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) scale, (2) the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), (3) the Rotator Cuff Quality of Life (RC-QoL), (4) the visual analog scale, and (5) the Medical Adherence Measure. Results: The final sample consisted of 100 patients (45 females, 45%) averaging 60.9 (±8.5) years. The average brace wearing time was 3.4 (±0.6) weeks, with an adherence superior to 80% in 84% of cases, and 96% of patients were living with family members. The mean postoperative DASH scores were 20.1 (±16.7), 23.4 (±25), and 18.9 (±21.5) for the general, work, and sport sections, respectively. The mean Medical Adherence Measure score reached 72.5 (±14.2) points, and the RC-QoL mean score was 30.4% (±20.5). The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale–Anxiety and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale–Depression scores' continuous mean values were 5.1 (±3.4) and 3.9 (±3.6), respectively. The DASH, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale–Anxiety, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale–Depression, and RC-QoL scores directly correlated with each other, and all these questionnaires directly correlated with the visual analog scale scores. Moreover, we found a direct correlation (r = 0.204, P = .033) between the female sex and adherence to the brace and a direct correlation (r = 0.242, P = .015) between adherence to the brace and the number of weeks it was worn according to the medical recommendation. A correlation between lower educational qualifications and poorer outcomes was found. No correlation emerged between adherence to the brace and functional results. According to the regression analysis, diabetes was found to be a predictor of worse postoperative DASH scores (β = 0.245, P = 0.28). Conclusion: A lower perceived quality of life was associated with worse functional results, anxiety and depression symptoms, and pain after rotator cuff repair surgery. The adherence to the use of the shoulder brace was associated with the female sex and a longer prognosis, but no correlation emerged between adherence to the brace and functional outcomes. © 2023 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees",Anxiety; arthroscopy; Case Series; depression; functional outcome; health-related quality of life (HRQoL); Level IV; Prognosis Study; psychological factors; rotator cuff tear; shoulder,"Arthroscopy; Female; Humans; Quality of Life; Retrospective Studies; Rotator Cuff; Rotator Cuff Injuries; Treatment Outcome; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; opiate; paracetamol; adult; arthroscopic rotator cuff repair; Article; clinical outcome; demographics; Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (score); female; follow up; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety; human; human tissue; major clinical study; male; medical adherence measure; medication adherence assessment; middle aged; postoperative period; psychologic assessment; psychological aspect; quality of life; retrospective study; rotator cuff quality of life; rotator cuff rupture; surgical technique; treatment refusal; visual analog scale; arthroscopy; psychology; quality of life; rotator cuff; rotator cuff injury; surgery; treatment outcome","""Shoulder Joint Health and Rehabilitation: Arthroscopic Surgeries, Treatments and Outcomes""",Clinical Outcomes and Treatments in Shoulder Care,Shoulder Surgery Outcomes and Measures

Unfortunately, following surgical ACL reconstruction in adolescents, the rates of ACL graft failure range from 17 to 19%. A contributing factor to the high reinjury rate in this population may be the limited evidence regarding appropriate criteria for allowing unrestricted return-to-activities (RTA) postoperatively. Several systematic reviews have already sought to develop a consensus on what criteria should be utilized for releasing patients to unrestricted sports activities; however, these reviews have focused on adult populations, a group at much lower risk for reinjury. Our objective is to systematically examine the literature and identify the criteria used when determining unrestricted RTA following an ACL reconstruction in an adolescent population. Methods: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, a systematic search will be performed of the MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus electronic databases. Searches will be conducted from January 1, 2000, until submission of the final review. Studies will be identified that include adolescent patients (10–18 years old) undergoing a primary ACL reconstruction and which have specified the criteria used to determine RTA. Each article will be independently screened by two reviewers. To supplement the electronic database search, citations within all included studies will be manually reviewed. Reviewers will record the RTA assessment utilized and the rates of ACL reinjury through a standardized data extraction sheet. Reviewers will resolve full-text screening and data extraction disagreements through discussion. Synthesis of the collected data will focus on compiling and mapping the most commonly used types of RTA criteria. Discussion: This systematic review will determine the most commonly used RTA criteria in adolescent patients post-ACL reconstruction. This will help future interventions build more effective adolescent-specific RTA assessments through the validation of current RTA criteria as well as the implementation of new criteria according to the identified literature gaps. © 2022, The Author(s).",Adolescent; Anterior cruciate ligament; Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Functional tests; Pediatric; Return to activity,Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Child; Humans; Joint Instability; Reinjuries; Sports; Systematic Reviews as Topic; adenosine triphosphate; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; biocompatibility; Cinahl; consensus; graft failure; human; joint instability; knee injury; knee instability; ligament surgery; Medline; meta analysis; Newcastle-Ottawa scale; practice guideline; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; reconstructive surgery; return to work; scoring system; adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament injury; child; injury; joint instability; procedures; sport,"""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction and Outcome Factors

However, many exercise cannot be performed as usual under the stay-at-home order. This study was a 12-week three-arm randomized controlled trial using the intention-to-treat principle, aiming to explore and compare the feasibility and effect of individual-based personalized aerobic-exercise and resistance-training prescriptions on depressive symptoms in college students, and conclude with some recommendations for individual-based exercise prescriptions. Methods: Eighty-six college students with depressive symptoms were randomized into aerobic-exercise (AE), resistance-training (RT), and wait-list control (WLC) groups. Participants in two experimental groups received 12-week personalized AE and RT prescriptions on their individual situations, respectively. No intervention was implemented on participants in the WLC group. Depressive symptoms and physical activity (PA) were measured by Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF), respectively. All data were collected at the baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks, and 4-week post-intervention. Results: At 12 weeks, 72.09% of depressive participants improved to “normal.” Participants exhibited a statistical reduction in SDS in all 3 groups (p < 0.05) at 12 weeks compared to baseline. Follow-up assessments showed no significant increase in SDS at 4-week post-intervention compared to 12 weeks (p > 0.05). The independent t-test revealed significantly lower SDS in AE and RT group than in WLC group (pAE < 0.001 and pRT < 0.05) at 4, 8, and 12 weeks, and 4-week post-intervention. Furthermore, the PA of participants (including total PA and intensities) in both experimental groups represented a significant improvement at 4-week post-intervention compared to baseline (p < 0.05), while no differences were observed in the PA of participants in the WLC group (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Personalized exercise prescriptions have good feasibility as they can increase adherence to intervention and reduce serious adverse events. Besides, individual-based personalized aerobic-exercise and resistance-training prescriptions result in a similar effect in relieving depressive symptoms and improving physical activity in college students. The individual-based exercise programs performed in 45- to 60- min with progressive moderate-to-vigorous intensity, 3 times/week for at least 12 weeks, may reduce depressive symptoms in college students during the COVID-19.

The purpose of this study was to investigate how a single bout of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise and whey protein, independently, as well as when combined, influence glycemia during an oral glucose tolerance test in sedentary, young men. Methods: Healthy males (n = 11) completed four randomized trials: no exercise/no whey protein (R); exercise (EX; walking at 70% VO2max for 60 min); 50 g of whey protein (W); and exercise combined with 50 g of whey protein (EXW). Each trial included a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) that was completed after an overnight fast. Blood samples were collected over a two-hour period during the OGTT. For EX and EXW, the exercise was performed the evening before the OGTT and the 50 g of whey protein was dissolved in 250 mL of water and was consumed as a preload 30 min prior to the OGTT. For R and EX, participants consumed 250 mL of water prior to the OGTT. Plasma samples were analyzed for glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) and glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and postprandial incremental area under the curve (iAUC) was calculated for each. Results: Glucose iAUC was reduced during W (− 32.9 ± 22.3 mmol/L) compared to R (122.7 ± 29.8 mmol/L; p < 0.01) and EX (154.3 ± 29.2 mmol/L; p < 0.01). Similarly, glucose iAUC was reduced for EXW (17.4 ± 28.9 mmol/L) compared to R and EX (p < 0.01 for both). There were no differences in iAUC for insulin, C-peptide, GIP, GLP-1, and glucagon between the four trials. Insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, GIP, and GLP-1 were elevated during the whey protein preload period for W and EXW compared to EX and R (p < 0.01). There were no differences for insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, GIP, or GLP-1 between trials for the remaining duration of the OGTT.

Sport is an evidence-based strategy for improving mental and physical health, and climbing is a type of sport that may positively impact both. The aim of this study is to test the effect of a manualized, psychosocial group climbing intervention on the well-being, distress, self-efficacy, and social cohesion of adolescents in Lebanon. In addition, the mechanisms behind psychological changes will be investigated. (2) Methods: In this mixed-methods waitlist-controlled study, we are allocating a minimum of 160 participants to an intervention (IG) or a control group (CG). The primary outcome is overall mental well-being (WEMWBS) after the 8-week intervention. Secondary outcomes include distress symptoms (K-6 Distress Scale), self-efficacy (General Self-Efficacy Scale; GSE), and social cohesion. Potential mechanisms of change and implementation factors are being investigated through qualitative interviews with a subgroup of 40 IG participants.

One of the reasons is a lack of clarity on the part of those who work in oncology clinical settings of their role in assessing, advising, and referring patients to exercise. Therefore, our study investigates reported physical activity counseling behavior of health care professionals (HCPs) and the patient perspective on this topic. Methods: Physicians (N = 52), nurses (N = 52) physical therapists (N = 26), and patients receiving HSCT (N = 62) participated in a nationwide cross-sectional online-survey. Patients‘ preferred source of information concerning PA was determined. We examined HCPs self-assessed PA counseling behavior and patients‘ PA recall by assessing the use of the 5As (Ask, Advice, Agree, Assist, Arrange). Analysis of survey responses was descriptive. Univariate multinomial logistic regression examined whether sociodemographic factors and patient characteristics influence the response behavior. Results: Physicians and PA specialists were patients‘ preferred source of information regarding PA. A large discrepancy between HCPs’ perception and the degree to which HSCT patients recall advice became apparent; profound counseling steps like making referrals were less often recalled in our patient sample. Inactive patients reported to receive less basic PA counseling by physicians. Conclusion: Future research should identify the requirements to increase patients’ recall concerning PA counseling in the setting of HSCT. Important messages about PA need to be made more salient to those who are less active and less engaged. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",communication; exercise; health promotion; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; medical staff; Physical activity counseling; recall,Counseling; Cross-Sectional Studies; Exercise; Health Promotion; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Stem Cell Transplantation; adult; article; controlled study; counseling; exercise; female; health promotion; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; human; major clinical study; male; medical staff; multicenter study; multinomial logistic regression; nurse; perception; physical activity; physician; physiotherapist; recall; sociodemographics; stem cell transplantation; counseling; cross-sectional study; exercise; physiology; stem cell transplantation,"""Physical Activity, Rehabilitation, and Health Outcomes in Medical Conditions""",Impact of Exercise and Rehabilitation on Quality of Life and Health in Patients,Exercise Programs and Physical Activity in Cancer Recovery

However, whether bone microarchitecture is altered in Para athletes is not known. Objective: We aimed to investigate BMD, bone microarchitecture and incidence of bone stress injuries in Norwegian elite Para athletes. Design: In this cross-sectional study in Para athletes, Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (iDXA, Lunar, GE Health Care) derived areal BMD, trabecular bone score (TBS), a surrogate marker for bone microarchitecture, and body composition (body weight (BW), lean body mass (LBM), fat mass (FM), fat percentage) were investigated and compared between ambulant and non-ambulant athletes. Also, the association between BMD, TBS and body composition variables was investigated. Incidence of BSI was assessed with a questionnaire and confirmed by a sports physician in a clinical interview. BMD Z-score <−1 was defined as low and ≤−2 as osteoporotic. TBS ≥ 1.31 was normal, 1.23–1.31 intermediate and <1.23 low. Results: Among 38 athletes (26 ± 6 yrs, 14 females), BMD Z-score was low in 19 athletes, and osteoporotic in 11 athletes' lumbar spine (LS) or femoral neck (FN). BMD was lower in non-ambulant vs. ambulant athletes both in LS (1.13 ± 0.19 vs. 1.25 ± 0.14 g/cm2, p = 0.030) and FN (0.90 ± 0.15 vs. 1.07 ± 0.16 g/cm2, p = 0.003). TBS was normal for all athletes. BMD Z-score in LS was positively associated with TBS (r = 0.408, p = 0.013), body weight (r = 0.326, p = 0.046) and lean body mass (r = 0.414, p = 0.010), but not with fat mass or fat percentage. None of the athletes reported any BSI. Conclusions: Half of the Norwegian elite Para athletes had low BMD, and 29% had BMD Z-score <−2 suggesting osteoporosis. Non-ambulant athletes were more prone to low BMD than ambulant athletes. However, despite high prevalence of low BMD, TBS was normal in all athletes, and BSI was absent in this young population. 2023 Koivisto-Mørk, Steffen, Finnes, Pretorius and Berge.",bone mineral density; bone stress injury; disabled athletes; osteopenia; osteoporosis; Paralympic athlete; trabecular bone score,,"""Physical Activity, Rehabilitation, and Health Outcomes in Medical Conditions""",Impact of Exercise and Rehabilitation on Quality of Life and Health in Patients,Gender Differences in Musculoskeletal Health & Physical Fitness

We aimed to 1) evaluate the rate of American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) conversion in patients with and without surgery, and 2) assess predictors of conversion in ASIA grade. Methods: The National Spinal Cord Injury Model Systems Database (SCIMS) was used from 1973 to 2016. Patients with SRSCI were included. The primary outcome was rate of conversion in ASIA grade. Multivariate logistic regression was performed with separate subgroup analysis on patients with cervical injury (represented by odds ratio [OR]; 95% confidence interval [CI]). Results: A total of 1647 patients had SRSCI with 1502 (91%) SSs. Most patients (88%) were male, white (87%), and between the ages of 15 and 29 years (63%). Patients undergoing SS had significantly longer inpatient rehabilitation length of stay (LOS) (P < 0.001) and a more patients undergoing SS had complete motor or sensory loss compared with the NSS group. Multivariate logistic regression showed that injury at the thoracic level (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.21–0.78), age 15–29 years (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.20–0.97]), water-based injury (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.21–0.95), and ASIA impairment grades of B, C, and D at admission were significantly associated with ASIA SCORE conversion. Conclusions: We found that patients undergoing SS had longer LOS and a higher prevalence of complete injuries. Surgical intervention was not associated with conversion in ASIA grade to an improved status at time of discharge in a large cohort of patients with SRSCI and in a subcohort of patients with cervical SRSCI. © 2022",American Spinal Injury Association; Conversion; Outcomes; Spinal cord injury; Sports; Sports-related spinal cord injury,Adolescent; Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Patient Discharge; Recovery of Function; Retrospective Studies; Spinal Cord Injuries; Spinal Injuries; Treatment Outcome; United States; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale; Article; Caucasian; child; cohort analysis; conservative treatment; controlled study; female; hospital discharge; hospital patient; human; length of stay; major clinical study; male; motor dysfunction; rehabilitation care; sensory dysfunction; spinal cord injury; spinal cord surgery; sport injury; surgical patient; thoracic spinal cord; treatment outcome; water sport; complication; convalescence; retrospective study; spinal cord injury; spine injury; treatment outcome; United States; young adult,"""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Spinal Cord Injury and Exercise Rehabilitation

The proposed system aims at recording critical kinetic (athlete biomechanics and oar/seat movements) and kinematic (boat position, velocity, acceleration, and attitude) parameters for sport performance evaluation and rowing technique improvement. The data acquisition unit is organized in two parts: the first part aims at logging boat kinematics based on GNSS/INS filtering, while the second one facilitates kinetics data recording using a series of analog sensors (potentiometers, strain gauges) installed on the athlete’s body and the boat seat and oars. Both parts are connected to a central unit featuring analog voltage digitizers and a micro-PC for device handling and data storing. In order to test the performance of the system a series of field trials were undertaken featuring different observation scenarios as well as intentionally induced errors in the rowing technique. Analysis revealed the high performance of the system in terms of sensor completeness and setup procedures as well as operational efficiency. Moreover, system performance evaluation exercised through studying raw data recordings and resultant parameters at stroke cycle and average (standardized) stroke cycle level confirmed the fruitfulness of the proposed approach and system and its potential for implementation on a broad scale. Finally, the data acquired from the proposed system were used to compute the adopted input parameters and performance indicators to characterize the system in terms of functionality and operational efficiency. © 2023 by the authors.",biomechanics; GNSS/INS; kinematics; kinetics; stroke cycle,Athletes; Athletic Performance; Biomechanical Phenomena; Humans; Movement; Water; Water Sports; Biomechanics; Data acquisition; Data handling; Efficiency; Global positioning system; Kinetics; Parameter estimation; Sports; Voltage dividers; water; Acceleration parameters; GNSS/INS; Monitoring system; Operational efficiencies; Performance; Position parameters; Rowing technique; Stroke cycle; Velocity parameters; Water monitoring systems; athlete; athletic performance; biomechanics; human; movement (physiology); water sport; Kinematics,"""Sports-Related Injury, Rehabilitation, and Performance Studies""",Rehabilitation and Assessment in Athletes with Chronic Ankle Instability,Wearable Devices and Techniques in Gait Analysis and Mobility Rehabilitation

The study aimed at investigating the relationship between the S.F.E.R.A. model theory (SFERA), a multidimensional model for enhancing sport performances, and MPA in professional musicians. The model allows to analyze performances by monitoring five constructs representing underlying cognitive and metacognitive factors that influence performance, highlighting individual strengths and improvement areas. The results confirmed that severe MPA symptoms are a common issue among musicians (47%), while 36% of the sample experienced musculoskeletal pain related to playing their musical instrument in the 2 months preceding the study. Moreover, musicians who suffered from practice-related pain reported higher levels of MPA. The SFERA factors were strongly and negatively correlated with MPA scores, suggesting that improving the SFERA factors might be helpful in reducing MPA: musicians with high MPA showed significantly lower SFERA scores. Moreover, Energy was the strongest predictor of MPA scores among the five SFERA factors, suggesting that musicians with high anxiety levels present difficulties on emotional regulation during the performance and struggle to focus on their performances while ignoring dysfunctional thoughts. The study indicates that SFERA scores can predict MPA and that sport psychology programs applied to the music field may also be useful protective factors for musicians’ psychophysiological health, especially in music academies and universities. © The Author(s) 2023.",music performance anxiety; musician’s health; prevention protocols; SFERA model; sport psychology,,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Physiological and Biomechanical Responses in Sports Performance

Symptoms of mTBI are thought to be associated with a neuropathological cascade, potentially involving the dysregulation of neurometabolites, lipids, and mitochondrial bioenergetics. Such alterations may play a role in the period of enhanced vulnerability that occurs after mTBI, such that a second mTBI will exacerbate neuropathology. However, it is unclear whether mTBI-induced alterations in neurometabolites and lipids that are involved in energy metabolism and other important cellular functions are exacerbated by repeat mTBI, and if such alterations are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Methods: In this experiment, using a well-established awake-closed head injury (ACHI) paradigm to model mTBI, male rats were subjected to a single injury, or five injuries delivered 1 day apart, and injuries were confirmed with a beam-walk task and a video observation protocol. Abundance of several neurometabolites was evaluated 24 h post-final injury in the ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampus using in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), and mitochondrial bioenergetics were evaluated 30 h post-final injury, or at 24 h in place of 1H-MRS, in the rostral half of the ipsilateral hippocampus. Lipidomic evaluations were conducted in the ipsilateral hippocampus and cortex. Results: We found that behavioral deficits in the beam task persisted 1- and 4 h after the final injury in rats that received repetitive mTBIs, and this was paralleled by an increase and decrease in hippocampal glutamine and glucose, respectively, whereas a single mTBI had no effect on sensorimotor and metabolic measurements. No group differences were observed in lipid levels and mitochondrial bioenergetics in the hippocampus, although some lipids were altered in the cortex after repeated mTBI. Discussion: The decrease in performance in sensorimotor tests and the presence of more neurometabolic and lipidomic abnormalities, after repeated but not singular mTBI, indicates that multiple concussions in short succession can have cumulative effects. Further preclinical research efforts are required to understand the underlying mechanisms that drive these alterations to establish biomarkers and inform treatment strategies to improve patient outcomes.

So, this study explored the relationship between body height and sagittal spinal curvatures and plantar pressure distribution in handball players. Method: According to handball player's body height, 63 male handball players were divided into two groups; group A (age, 23.54 ± 1.32 years) consisted of 30 handball players with body height above average, and group B (age, 23.40 ± 1.73 years) consisted of 33 handball players with body height below average. The thoracic and lumbar curvatures and trunk height were measured with the Formetric III 4D spine, and the DIERS Pedoscan device was used to assess the plantar pressure distribution for both groups. Results: The thoracic kyphosis of group A was significantly higher than that of group B (p = 0.001), without a significant difference in lumbar lordosis (p = 0.086). Group A showed a significant increase in the forefeet pressure and a significant decrease in the rearfeet pressure compared to group B (p = 0.001). There was a high positive correlation between the body height and trunk length, and body height and kyphosis angle (r = 0.932, r = 0.665, respectively). There was a high positive correlation between the body height and forefoot plantar pressure (r = 0.665, p < 0.01). Conclusion: The taller handball players have an increased thoracic kyphosis angle and forefeet pressure compared to shorter handball players. © The Author(s) 2024.",Body height; handball players; plantar pressure; spinal curvatures,,"""Muscle Strength, Endurance, and Injury Risk in Upper-Extremity Sports Performance""",Muscular Strength and Injury Risk in Athletes,Injury Risk and Performance in Athletes

This study was aimed to investigate associations between individual differences in physical fitness tests and neuromuscular properties. Methods: One hundred and thirty-three young adults participated in various general physical fitness tests and neuromuscular measurements. The appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) was estimated by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Echo intensity (EI) was evaluated from the vastus lateralis. During submaximal knee extension force, high-density surface electromyography of the vastus lateralis was recorded and individual motor unit firings were detected. Y-intercept (i-MU) and slope (s-MU) from the regression line between the recruitment threshold and motor unit firing rate were calculated. Results: Stepwise multiple regression analyses revealed that knee extension strength could be explained (adjusted R 2 = 0.712) by ASM (β = 0.723), i-MU (0.317), EI (− 0.177), and s-MU (0.210). Five-sec stepping could be explained by ASM (adjusted R 2 = 0.212). Grip strength, side-stepping, and standing broad jump could be explained by ASM and echo intensity (adjusted R 2 = 0.686, 0.354, and 0.627, respectively). Squat jump could be explained by EI (adjusted R 2 = 0.640). Counter-movement jump could be explained by EI and s-MU (adjusted R 2 = 0.631). On the other hand, i-MU and s-MU could be explained by five-sec stepping and counter-movement jump, respectively, but the coefficients of determination were low (adjusted R 2 = 0.100 and 0.045). Conclusion: Generally developed physical fitness tests were mainly explained by morphological factors, but were weakly affected by neural factors involved in performance. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Decomposition; Echo intensity; High-density surface electromyography; Motor unit; Ultrasound,,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Gender Differences in Musculoskeletal Health & Physical Fitness

Design, Setting, and Population: We conducted a prospective cohort study of children ages 8.0 to 16.9 years with mTBI (n = 633) or orthopedic injury (OI; n = 334), recruited from 5 pediatric emergency departments from September 2016 to December 2018. Main Measures: Participants completed baseline assessments within 48 hours of injury, and postconcussion symptoms assessments at 7 to 10 days, weekly to 3 months, and biweekly to 6 months post-injury. Preinjury psychosocial function was measured using parent ratings on the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), retrospectively evaluating their child's status prior to the injury. Parent and child ratings on the Health and Behavior Inventory (HBI) (cognitive and somatic subscales) and the Post-Concussion Symptom Interview (PCS-I) were used as measures of postconcussion symptoms. We fitted 6 longitudinal regression models, which included 747 to 764 participants, to evaluate potential interactions between preinjury psychosocial function and injury group as predictors of child- and parent-reported postconcussion symptoms. Results: Preinjury psychosocial function moderated group differences in postconcussion symptoms across the first 6 months post-injury. Higher emotional and conduct problems were significantly associated with more severe postconcussion symptoms among children with mTBI compared with OI. Wald's χ2for interaction terms (injury group × SDQ subscales) ranged from 6.3 to 10.6 (P values <.001 to.043) across parent- and child-reported models. In contrast, larger group differences (mTBI > OI) in postconcussion symptoms were associated with milder hyperactivity (Wald's χ2: 15.3-43.0, all P <.001), milder peer problems (Wald's χ2: 11.51, P =.003), and higher social functioning (Wald's χ2: 12.435, P =.002). Conclusions: Preinjury psychosocial function moderates postconcussion symptoms in pediatric mTBI, highlighting the importance of assessing preinjury psychosocial function in children with mTBI. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Hypothesis: DOMS in trunk muscles has a negative effect on respiratory function parameters, respiratory muscle strength, respiratory muscle endurance, and exercise capacity. Study Design: Prospective cohort study. Level of Evidence: Level 2. Methods: In 24 healthy participants with a mean age of 21 ± 2 years, DOMS was induced for the trunk muscles with a load equal to 80% of the maximum repetitive voluntary contraction. Pulmonary function parameters, respiratory muscle strength and endurance, exercise capacity, pain, fatigue, and dyspnea perception severity were recorded before DOMS and at 24 and 48 hours after DOMS. Results: After DOMS, decreases were observed in respiratory function parameters, namely, forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in the first second, vital capacity, and 25% to 75% flow rate value of forced expiratory volume (25% to 75%) (P = 0.02, P = 0.02, P < 0.01, P = 0.01, respectively). Maximal inspiratory pressure and exercise capacity also decreased (P = 0.02, P < 0.01, respectively). No difference was observed between all 3 measurements of maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) and MEP% values (P1 = P2 = P3 ≥ 0.99). The results of the respiratory muscle endurance tests did not reveal a significant difference in terms of load and time in all 3 conditions (P > 0.05). Conclusion: After DOMS, there was a 4% to 7.5% decrease in respiratory function parameters, and a 6.6% decrease in respiratory muscle strength. Clinical Relevance: The occurrence of DOMS before a competition can have a detrimental impact on pulmonary performance. Hence, it is imperative to consider this factor when devising training and exercise programs. In addition, the development of treatment protocols becomes crucial if DOMS arises. © 2023 The Author(s).",exercise; muscle soreness; respiration pulmonary function tests; ventilatory muscles,,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Muscle Strength and Recovery in Sports Performance

The widely-used measures based on wearables are epoch-based physical activity counts using accelerometer data. Even though activity counts have been the backbone of thousands of clinical and epidemiological studies, there are large variations of the algorithms that compute counts and their associated parameters—many of which have often been kept proprietary by device providers. This lack of transparency has hindered comparability between studies using different devices and limited their broader clinical applicability. ActiGraph devices have been the most-used wearable accelerometer devices for over two decades. Recognizing the importance of data transparency, interpretability and interoperability to both research and clinical use, we here describe the detailed counts algorithms of five generations of ActiGraph devices going back to the first AM7164 model, and publish the current counts algorithm in ActiGraph’s ActiLife and CentrePoint software as a standalone Python package for research use. We believe that this material will provide a useful resource for the research community, accelerate digital health science and facilitate clinical applications of wearable accelerometry. © 2022, The Author(s).",,Acceleration; Accelerometry; Exercise; Software; Wearable Electronic Devices; acceleration; accelerometry; electronic device; exercise; software,"""Application of Machine Learning and Biomechanics in Musculoskeletal Health and Wearable Devices""","Knee Assessment and Recovery: Validity, Reliability, and Clinical Trials",Wearable Devices and Techniques in Gait Analysis and Mobility Rehabilitation

Existential anxiety or meaninglessness may contribute to these thoughts and behaviors. The current study aims to examine the impact of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy on reducing existential anxiety and the propensity for self-harming behaviors and suicidal ideations among students. The present study was quasi-experimental, and its research design was pre-test-post-test with a control group. The statistical population of the research consisted of the students of Hamedan Azad University in 2022. The convenience sampling method was used to select the sample. After the Self-Harm Inventory (1998), Lawrence Good’s Preliminary Measure of Existential Anxiety (1974), and Beck’s Scale-for-Suicidal-Ideation (1961) were implemented among the statistical population of the research. The essential data was collected and analyzed using SPSS-26 software. Sixteen individuals with scores above the cut-off point were chosen and randomly divided into two groups of eight people each: An intervention group and a control group. The intervention group was exposed to the Acceptance and Commitment Therapy group for eight sessions. Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was used to analyze the data. The results revealed that Acceptance and Commitment Therapy significantly reduced existential anxiety (P ≤ 0.001), self-harming tendencies (P ≤ 0.001), and suicidal ideations (P ≤ 0.001). The study’s findings suggest that Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is essential in reducing suicidal ideations, self-harm tendencies, and existential anxiety. As a result, it effectively promotes mental health and fosters community well-being. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Acceptance and commitment therapy; Anxiety; Self-harming behavior; Suicidal ideations,,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Impact of Physical Exercise on Mental Health Disorders

As activity promotion is particularly important in adolescents with congenital heart disease (CHD) this randomized-controlled trail examines if Digital Health Nudging via daily smartphone messages increases PA, activity-related self-efficacy (ArSE) and health-related quality of life (HrQoL) in adolescents with CHD. Methods: From May 2021 to April 2022, 97 patients (15.1 ± 2.0 years, 50% girls) with moderate or severe CHD were randomly allocated 1:1 to intervention (IG) or control group (CG). Daily PA was objectively assessed in minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) by the wearable “Garmin Vivofit jr. 2” over the entire study period. The IG received daily smartphone messages based on Bandura's social cognitive theory on the subject of PA over a period of 12-weeks. Results: According to the linear mixed model, the change of MVPA over the study period did not significantly differ between IG and CG when taking baseline MVPA into account (b = 0.136, 95%-CI [-0.355; 0.627], P =.587). Activity level was comparably high and showed only minor variability in both groups with 73.7 [62.3; 78.8] min/day in IG and 78.4 [66.6; 93.9] min/d in CG throughout the whole 12-weeks. Emotional well-being significantly increased over the study period in the IG (IG: Δ1.60 [-0.2; 6.3] vs CG: Δ0.0 [-12.5; 6.3], P =.043), but not total HrQoL (P =.518) and ArSE (P =.305). Conclusions: 12-weeks, of Digital Health Nudging did not increase PA, but improved feelings of emotional well-being in adolescents with CHD.

Objective: Translating, culturally adapting, and validating the Italian version of the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT-I). Summary of background data: Ankle sprains are one of the most common musculoskeletal injuries and can lead to chronic ankle instability (CAI). The International Ankle Consortium recommends the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT) as a valid and reliable self-report questionnaire assessing the presence and severity of CAI. At this moment, there is no validated Italian version of CAIT. Methods: The Italian version of the CAIT (CAIT-I) was developed by an expert committee. Test-retest reliability of the CAIT-I was measured in 286 healthy and injured participants within a 4–9-day period, by using Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC2,1). Construct validity, exploratory factor analysis, internal consistency and sensitivity were examined in a sample of 548 adults. Instrument responsiveness over 4 time points was determined in a subgroup of 37 participants. Results: The CAIT-I demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability (ICC≥0.92) and good internal consistency (α = .84). Construct validity was confirmed. Identified cut-off for the presence of CAI was 24.75, with sensitivity= 0.77 and specificity= 0.65. There were significant differences across time for CAIT-I scores (P < .001), demonstrating responsiveness to change, but no floor or ceiling effects. Conclusion: The CAIT-I demonstrates acceptable psychometric performance as a screening and outcome measure.

Studies have shown an association between MME and knee pain and that surgical treatment can reduce the extent of MME. Here, we describe the beneficial effects of physical therapy as a feasible conservative treatment for MME. Methods Data of 30 patients with knee osteoarthritis who underwent stretching of the semimembranosus tendon and passive range of motion (ROM) exercises twice a week for 8 weeks were retrospectively analyzed. MME was the measured distance between the medial meniscus and the line connecting the medial borders of the femur and tibia using ultrasound. Ultrasound findings of surrounding tissues, including the deep posterior bundle of the medial collateral ligament (dMCL), were recorded. Additionally, knee extension ROM was measured, and inner knee pain when walking was evaluated using a numerical rating scale. Results There were significant improvements between the baseline and 8 weeks for MME in the non-weight-bearing position (3.6 ± 0.3 mm vs. 3.0 ± 0.4 mm), MME in the weight-bearing position (4.3 ± 0.4 mm vs. 3.8 ± 0.5 mm), ROM (−12.3◦ ± 4.1◦ vs. −3.1◦ ± 3.8◦), and knee pain (7.0 ± 0.9 vs. 1.1 ± 1.4) (each p < 0.001). In almost all cases in which the knee extension ROM improved, the dMCL was bulging at the baseline; after 8 weeks, the dMCL was flattened, suggesting ligament tension on ultrasound imaging. Conclusion Stretching of the semimembranosus tendon and passive ROM exercises may reduce the extent of MME in patients with knee osteoarthritis. The ultrasound findings suggest that improvement in knee extension ROM may have led to the re-acquisition of MCL tension, which may have influenced MME reduction. Therefore, physical therapy may be a feasible conservative treatment for the reduction of MME. Copyright: © 2022 Yoshizuka et al.

No significant between-group difference in PPT was found for the rest occasions. There was no significant between-group difference in NRS, MVIC, and SLFJ on any occasion (p ≥ 0.052). DOMS was not correlated with MIVC and SLFJ (p ≥ 0.09). Conclusions: PBM or low-intensity stretching did not affect DOMS and functional performance in untrained individuals. The combination of PBM and low-intensity stretching increased pain sensitivity and did not relieve soreness. The DOMS was not associated with either muscle function or functional performance.  © Copyright 2022, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2022.",delayed-onset muscle soreness; maximum isometric voluntary contraction; photobiomodulation; pressure pain threshold; stretching,"Exercise; Humans; Isometric Contraction; Muscle, Skeletal; Myalgia; Pain Threshold; Correlation methods; Delayed-onset muscle soreness; Functional performance; Group differences; Isometric voluntary contraction; Low-intensity; Maximum isometric voluntary contraction; Muscle soreness; Pain threshold; Photobiomodulation; Pressure pain threshold; controlled study; exercise; human; muscle isometric contraction; myalgia; pain threshold; physiology; randomized controlled trial; skeletal muscle; Muscle","""Effects of Different Therapeutic Interventions on Muscular and Neural Health""",Muscle Rehabilitation and Training Effects in Injury Recovery,Muscle Strength and Recovery in Sports Performance

A principal and irreversible cause of joint contracture has been regarded as the development of joint capsule fibrosis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying contracture remain unclear. We established a mouse model of knee joint contracture, revealing that fibrosis in joint capsules causes irreversible contracture. RNA-sequencing of contracture capsules demonstrated a marked enrichment of the genes involved in the extracellular region, particularly periostin (Postn). Three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging and immunohistological analysis of contracture patients revealed posterior joint capsule thickening with abundant type I collagen (Col1a2) and POSTN in humans. Col1a2-GFPTG; Postn−/− mice and chimeric mice with Col1a2-GFPTG; tdTomatoTG bone marrow showed fibrosis in joint capsules caused by bone marrow-derived fibroblasts, and POSTN promoted the migration of bone marrow-derived fibroblasts, contributing to fibrosis and contracture. Conversely, POSTN-neutralizing antibody attenuated contracture exacerbation. Our findings identified POSTN as a key inducer of fibroblast migration that exacerbates capsule fibrosis, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for joint contracture. © 2023 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.",fibroblast; fibrosis; joint contracture; migration; periostin,"Animals; Bone Marrow; Contracture; Fibroblasts; Fibrosis; Humans; Mice; Range of Motion, Articular; collagen type 1; RNA; transcription factor RUNX2; Collagen Type I, alpha2 Subunit; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bone marrow cell; cell migration; clinical article; controlled study; female; fibroblast; fibrosis; human; human cell; immobilization; immunohistology; joint capsule; joint contracture; male; mouse; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; RNA sequencing; three-dimensional imaging; young adult; animal; bone marrow; contracture; fibroblast; genetics; joint characteristics and functions; pathology",Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Advances in Tissue Regeneration and Healing in Musculoskeletal Disorders

Monitoring player impacts is vitally important to understanding and protecting from injuries like concussion. Typically, to analyze this data, a combination of video analysis and sensor data is used to ascertain the recorded events are true impacts and not false positives. In fact, due to the nature of using wearable devices in sports, false positives vastly outnumber the true positives. Yet, manual video analysis is time-consuming. This imbalance leads traditional machine learning approaches to exhibit poor performance in both detecting true positives and preventing false negatives. Here, we show that by simulating head impacts numerically using a standard Finite Element head-neck model, a large dataset of synthetic impacts can be created to augment the gathered, verified, impact data from mouthguards. This combined physics-informed machine learning impact detector reported improved performance on test datasets compared to traditional impact detectors with negative predictive value and positive predictive values of 88 and 87% respectively. Consequently, this model reported the best results to date for an impact detection algorithm for American football, achieving an F1 score of 0.95. In addition, this physics-informed machine learning impact detector was able to accurately detect true and false impacts from a test dataset at a rate of 90% and 100% relative to a purely manual video analysis workflow. Saving over 12 h of manual video analysis for a modest dataset, at an overall accuracy of 92%, these results indicate that this model could be used in place of, or alongside, traditional video analysis to allow for larger scale and more efficient impact detection in sports such as American Football. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Biomedical Engineering Society.",American football; Concussion; Deep learning; Instrumented mouthguard; Physics-informed machine learning; Traumatic brain injury,Acceleration; Biomechanical Phenomena; Brain Concussion; Football; Head; Head Protective Devices; Humans; Machine Learning; Mouth Protectors; Physics; Brain; Deep learning; Learning systems; Sports; Statistical tests; American footballs; Concussion; Deep learning; Head impact; Instrumented mouthguard; Machine-learning; Mouthguards; Physic-informed machine learning; Traumatic Brain Injuries; Video analysis; accuracy; Article; athlete; concussion; finite element analysis; head injury; human; kinematics; machine learning; monitoring; physics; predictive value; simulation; traumatic brain injury; videorecording; acceleration; biomechanics; brain concussion; football; head; helmet; injury; machine learning; mouth protector; physics; Large dataset,"""Application of Machine Learning and Biomechanics in Musculoskeletal Health and Wearable Devices""","Knee Assessment and Recovery: Validity, Reliability, and Clinical Trials",Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Skeletal muscle adaptations to a novel heavy progressive weighted wheel running exercise model in C57BL/6 mice,2024,Experimental Physiology,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176957352&doi=10.1113%2fEP091494&partnerID=40&md5=1598078d1f17145598e83832e7612efa,"Murine exercise models are developed to study the molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating muscle mass. A progressive weighted wheel running model, named ‘PoWeR’, was previously developed to serve as a more translatable alternative to involuntary resistance-type exercise models in rodents, such as synergist ablation. However, mice still run great distances despite the added resistance as evidenced by a large glycolytic-to-oxidative shift in muscle fibre type. Thus, PoWeR reflects a blended resistance/endurance model. In an attempt to bias PoWeR further towards resistance-type exercise, we developed a novel heavy PoWeR model (hPoWeR) utilizing higher wheel loads (max of 12.5 g vs 6 g). Adult male C57BL/6 mice voluntarily performed an 8-week progressive loading protocol (PoWeR or hPoWeR). Running distance peaked at ∼5–6 km day−1 in both treatments and was maintained by PoWeR mice, but declined in the hPoWeR mice as load increased beyond 7.5 g. Peak isometric force of the gastrocnemius–soleus–plantaris complex tended to increase in wheel running treatments. Soleus mass increased by 19% and 24% in PoWeR and hPoWeR treatments, respectively, and plantaris fibre cross-sectional area was greater in hPoWeR, compared to PoWeR. There were fewer glycolytic and more oxidative fibres in the soleus and plantaris muscles in the PoWeR treatment, but not hPoWeR. Collectively, these data suggest hPoWeR may modestly alter skeletal muscle supporting the aim of better reflecting typical resistance training adaptations, in line with decreased running volume and exposure to higher resistance. Regardless, PoWeR remains an effective hypertrophic concurrent training model in mice. © 2023 The Authors.

METHODS: Forty-one male participants were divided into two groups according to quantified foot postures using the Foot Posture Index (FPI-6) scores: the neutral foot group (FPI-6 score: 0 to +5) and the pronated foot group (FPI-6 score: >+6).The IFMs thickness was measured using ultrasound images of the flexor digitorum brevis (FDB), flexor hallucis brevis (FHB), and abductor hallucis muscles.To investigate the association between IFMs thickness and dynamic postural stability, the Biodex Balance System (BBS) was used in a single-leg stance position with both the eyes open and closed. RESULTS: In the BBS tests, the pronated foot group demonstrated significant results in the eyes-closed condition (p<.05). In particular, the differences between the eyes open and closed conditions in postural stability indices were significantly greater in the pronated foot group than in the neutral foot group (p<.05). No significant differences in IFMs thickness between the two groups were observed; however, some subdomains of the FPI-6 demonstrated significant positive correlations with postural stability indices and significant negative correlations with IFMs thickness (p<.05).The talonavicular joint was associated with FDB thickness (R=-0.311). Moreover, the forefoot was correlated with FHB thickness (R=-0.327). CONCLUSIONS: The aforementioned results suggest that dynamic postural stability and IFMs thickness are affected by the foot type. Although no significant differences in IFMs thickness were observed, dynamic postural stability and IFMs thickness reduced as the foot displayed features of pronation.This indicates that postural control ability and IFMs are vulnerable to changes in foot posture. © 2023 Korean Society of Exercise Physiology.",Dynamic Postural Stability; Foot posture; Intrinsic foot muscle; Muscle thickness; Pronated foot,,"""Effects of Various Interventions on Postural Stability and Balance Control""",Postural Stability and Lower Limb Motor Control Studies,Evaluation and Improvement of Postural Balance and Muscle Strength

Soccer players suffered from the restrictions, being unable to train and have a social life. The aim of this study was to compare differences in daytime sleepiness between genders and qualification levels in a cohort university Chinese soccer player under 0 Covid policy restrictions in the urban area of Shanghai. Methods: 491 questionnaires of Epworth Sleepiness Scales (ESS) were compiled online by male and female Soccer Students (SS), Semi-Professional players (SP) and Professional Players (PP) during the ongoing restriction measures post Shanghai lockdown. ANOVA was performed for players levels and gender. Results: Significant differences were found between the 3 levels and between males and females. PP showed a very low score in the ESS (5,97) well below the threshold of 8 for daytime sleepiness, while SS and SP showed an ESS score above the threshold. Female showed higher scores in comparison to males. Differences between males and females reflect the confinement conditions in the ESS items, showing more difference in the item of ESS which are related with indoor situations. Conclusions: This study shows the first data on sleepiness in Chinese soccer players of different level of qualification immediately post lockdown condition. Professional male’s players sleepiness was lower, than females, SS and SP after the exceptional lockdown measures. The reasons can reside in the more ordered lifestyle of PP in comparison to SS and SP, which mitigated the effects of the lockdown. Our results suggest that measures to improve sleep in females’ soccer player should be adopted if these exceptional conditions will happen again. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Daytime sleepiness; Epworth Scale; Fatigue; Female soccer players; Stress,adolescent; adult; Article; Chinese; cohort analysis; daytime somnolence; Epworth sleepiness scale; female; gender; human; lockdown; male; policy; professional athlete; sex difference; soccer player; student; urban area; young adult,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Purpose: To identify additional risk factors for concomitant meniscal injury, including preinjury joint laxity and lower extremity alignment, in athletes with sport-related ACL injury. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: This study included 180 participants aged 13 to 26 years who underwent ACL reconstruction (ACLR) after a first-time ACL injury sustained during participation in sport. Contralateral lower extremity alignment and joint laxity were used as surrogate measures for the injured knee before trauma. Concomitant meniscal tear patterns were identified at the time of ACLR. Sex-specific analyses were conducted. Results: Concomitant meniscal injury was observed in 60.6% of the subjects. The prevalence of concomitant injury was higher in male than female participants (69.9% vs 54.2%; P =.035) due to a higher prevalence of lateral meniscal injuries (56.2% vs 38.3%; P =.018). Among male patients, there was a significant difference in the prevalence of concomitant lateral meniscal tear according to sport participation (≥9 vs <9 h/week: 67.4% vs 35.7%; P =.032). Among male patients, the likelihood of concomitant injury to both the lateral and medial menisci increased by 28.8% for each 1-mm decrease in navicular drop. Among female patients, the likelihood of concomitant injury to the lateral meniscus increased by 15% per degree increase in genu recurvatum and 14% per degree decrease in standing quadriceps angle, with similar effects on the likelihood of concurrent injury to both the lateral and medial menisci. Conclusion: Measures of lower extremity alignment and genu recurvatum previously identified as risk factors for ACL injury were also associated with concomitant meniscal injury in female patients while other risk factors, including BMI and joint laxity, were not. Increased time spent participating in sport and navicular drop were associated with concomitant meniscal injury in male patients. © The Author(s) 2023.",anterior cruciate ligament; knee; meniscus; risk factors; trauma,adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; arthroscopy; Article; athlete; body height; body mass; body weight; clinical feature; cross-sectional study; female; genu recurvatum; hamstring muscle; human; joint laxity; knee joint; knee meniscus rupture; knee stiffness; lateral meniscus; logistic regression analysis; lower limb; major clinical study; male; medial meniscus; outcome assessment; prevalence; risk factor; sport,"""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction and Outcome Factors

Conclusions: a study of 29 people with a history of severe COVID-19 found DM in 16 (55.1%) of them. In 34.5% of the studied people DM was diagnosed before or during the COVID-19, which may indicate a more severe course of the disease. However, an increase in newly diagnosed DM almost 2 years after recovery from severe COVID-19 has not yet been found. An increase in potential risk factors for DM (higher BMI, lower PA and functional endurance) was found in this group, comparing to the control. Correlations between age and characteristics of the studied subjects were identified, which can be used to assess BA. © V.I. Kravchenko, T.F. Zakharchenko, V.G. Gurianov, V.A. Kovtun, V.A.

The number and specificity of PNBs, however, have made choosing the best option for a procedure nebulous for orthopaedic surgeons. Purpose: To present a narrative literature review of the PNBs available for arthroscopic hip and knee procedures that is adapted to an audience of orthopaedic surgeons. Study Design: Narrative literature review. Methods: A combination of the names of various lower extremity PNBs AND “hip arthroscopy” OR “knee arthroscopy” was used to search the English medical literature including PubMed, Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect, Embase, and Scopus. Placement technique, specificity of blockade, efficacy, and complications were assessed. Searches were performed through May 2, 2021. Results: A total of 157 studies were included in this review of lower extremity PNBs. Femoral nerve, lumbar plexus, sciatic nerve, and fascia iliaca compartment blocks were most commonly used in arthroscopic hip surgery, while femoral nerve, 3-in-1, and adductor canal blocks were preferred for arthroscopic knee surgery. Each block demonstrated a significant benefit (P >.05) in ≥1 of the following outcomes: intraoperative morphine, pain scores, nausea, and/or opioid consumption. Combination blocks including the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block, obturator nerve block, quadratus lumborum block, and L1 and L2 paravertebral block have also been described. Complication rates ranged from 0% to 4.8% in those administered with ultrasound guidance. The most commonly reported complications included muscular weakness, postoperative falls, neuropathy, intravascular and intraneural injections, and hematomas. Conclusion: When administered properly, PNBs were a safe and effective adjuvant method of pain control with a significant potential to limit postoperative narcotic use. While blockade choice varies by surgeon preference and procedure, all PNBs should be administered with ultrasound guidance, and vigilant protocols for the risk of postoperative falls should be exercised in patients who receive them. © 2022 The Author(s).",arthroscopic hip surgery; arthroscopic knee surgery; nerve block; peripheral nerve blockade,"Femoral Nerve; Humans; Lower Extremity; Nerve Block; Pain, Postoperative; Surgeons; femoral nerve; human; lower limb; nerve block; postoperative pain; procedures; surgeon; surgery","""Lower Extremity Health and Biomechanics: Studies on Pain, Function, and Treatment Methods""",Lower Limb Biomechanics and Pain Management in Chronic Conditions,Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation in Osteoarthritis Patients

When combined with rotator cuff tear (RCT), treatments can be more complex. Currently, targeted therapy is lacking. Since adhesive capsulitis is reported to be related to circulating materials, we analyzed the contents and biology of circulating exosomes from RCT patients with and without adhesive capsulitis, in an attempt to developing a targeting treatment. Methods: Samples from a consecutive cohort of patients with RCT for surgery were collected. Circulating exosomal miRNAs sequencing were used to detect differentially expressed miRNAs in patients with and without adhesive capsulitis. For experiments in vitro, Brdu staining, CCK-8 assay, wound healing test, collagen contraction test, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and western blot were conducted. Histological and immunofluorescent staining, and biomechanical analysis were applied in a mouse model of shoulder stiffness. The characteristics of liposomes loaded with siRNA were measured via dynamic light scattering or electron microscopy. Results: Circulating exosomal miRNAs sequencing showed that, compared to exosomes from patients without adhesive capsulitis, miR-142 was significantly up-regulated in exosomes from adhesive capsulitis (Exo-S). Both Exo-S and miR-142 could inhibit fibrogenesis, and the anti-fibrotic effect of Exo-S relied on miR-142. The target of miR-142 was proven to be transforming growth factor β receptor 1 (Tgfbr1). Then, liposomes were developed and loaded with si-Tgfbr1. The si-Tgfbr1-loading liposomes exhibited promising therapeutic effect against shoulder stiffness in mouse model with no evidence toxicity. Conclusion: This study showed that, in RCT patients with adhesive capsulitis, circulating exosomes are protective and have anti-fibrotic potential. This effect is related to the contained miR-142, which targets Tgfbr1. By mimicking this biological function, liposomes loaded with si-Tgfbr1 can mitigate shoulder stiffness pre-clinically. © 2022, The Author(s).",Adhesive capsulitis; Circulating exosomes; Liposomes; miRNAs; Rotator cuff tear,,Advancements in Therapies and Technologies for Osteoarthritis and Joint Disorders,Therapeutic Interventions and Their Efficacy in Osteoarthritis Treatment,Advances in Tissue Regeneration and Healing in Musculoskeletal Disorders

However, little research has been conducted into this relationship on an individual patient basis, or the influence of demographic and psychosocial factors such as patient affect—the subjective experience of emotion. Hypothesis: The relationship between postoperative activity level and knee function will vary between patients and will be influenced by the patients’ affect and demographic characteristics. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Activity, knee function, demographic, and affect data were collected from patients enrolled in an ongoing trial for the treatment of articular cartilage lesions at preoperative and 2-, 12-, and 15-month postoperative points. Quantile mixed regression modeling was used to determine the patient-to-patient variation in activity level and knee function. Multiple linear regression and partial correlation analyses were performed to determine whether demographic characteristics and patient affect were associated with this variation. Results: A total of 62 patients were included in the study (23 female; 39 male; mean age, 38.3 ± 9.5 years). We found substantial variation between patients in the relationship between activity level and knee function, with most patients (n = 56) demonstrating a positive relation (positive slope), but 6 patients demonstrating a negative relation (negative slope). A negative affect (NA) score was significantly correlated with the slope between activity level and knee function (rS = –0.30; P =.018) and was a significant individual predictor of knee function at 15 months postoperatively (coefficient = –3.5; P =.025). Conclusion: Our results suggest that the relationship between activity level and knee function varies between patients. The patients with a higher NA score were likely to report smaller improvements in knee function with increasing activity levels compared with those with a lower NA score. © The Author(s) 2023.",cartilage repair; cell therapy; knee function; physical activity; psychosocial factors,adult; article; articular cartilage; cell therapy; cohort analysis; controlled study; correlation analysis; demographics; female; human; knee function; major clinical study; male; physical activity; preoperative evaluation,"""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Hip Arthroscopy Outcomes and Rehabilitation

Impaired cooling with PPE warrants investigation into practical strategies to improve work capacity and mitigate exertional heat illness. Purpose: Examine physiological and subjective effects of forearm immersion (FC), fan mist (MC), and passive cooling (PC) following three intermittent treadmill bouts while wearing PPE. Methods: Twelve males (27 ± 6 years; 57.6 ± 6.2 ml/kg/min; 78.3 ± 8.1 kg; 183.1 ± 7.2 cm) performed three 50-min (10 min of 40%, 70%, 40%, 60%, 50% vVO2max) treadmill bouts in the heat (36 °C, 30% relative humidity). Thirty minutes of cooling followed each bout, using one of the three strategies per trial. Rectal temperature (Tcore), skin temperature (Tsk), heart rate (HR), heart rate recovery (HRR), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), thirst, thermal sensation (TS), and fatigue were obtained. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (condition x time) detected differences between interventions. Results: Final Tcore was similar between trials (P >.05). Cooling rates were larger in FC and MC vs PC following bout one (P <.05). HRR was greatest in FC following bouts two (P =.013) and three (P <.001). Tsk, fluid consumption, and sweat rate were similar between all trials (P >.05). TS and fatigue during bout three were lower in MC, despite similar Tcore and HR. Conclusion: Utilizing FC and MC during intermittent work in the heat with PPE yields some thermoregulatory and cardiovascular benefit, but military health and safety personnel should explore new and novel strategies to mitigate risk and maximize performance under hot conditions while wearing PPE. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Body cooling; Exercise; Heat stress; Military; Thermoregulation,Body Temperature; Body Temperature Regulation; Fatigue; Heart Rate; Hot Temperature; Humans; Male; Personal Protective Equipment; Protective Clothing; Skin Temperature; body temperature; fatigue; heart rate; high temperature; human; male; physiology; skin temperature; thermoregulation,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Purpose: To evaluate minimum 2-year outcomes for patients undergoing accelerated bilateral arthroscopy against those undergoing (1) delayed bilateral and (2) unilateral arthroscopy. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A retrospective review was performed of prospectively collected data from patients undergoing bilateral primary hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement between 2009 and 2022. Inclusion criteria entailed competitive athletes with concurrent bilateral symptoms at initial presentation. Exclusion criteria (either hip) were Tönnis grade >1, dysplasia (lateral center-edge angle <25°), Perthes disease, protrusio acetabuli, and avascular necrosis. Two groups were established based on the duration between procedures: within 7 days (accelerated group) and within 4 to 12 weeks (delayed group). Patients from the accelerated group were matched in a 1:2 ratio with patients undergoing unilateral surgery based on age ±2 years, sex, and athletic status. Minimum 2-year postoperative patient-reported outcomes (PROs) (including modified Harris Hip Score, University of California Los Angeles activity scale, 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index), rates of achieving the minimal clinically important difference, rates of continuing to play main sport, and satisfaction were compared between groups. Results: A total of 131 athletes (262 hips) with bilateral femoroacetabular impingement were included: 91 in the accelerated group and 40 in the delayed group. Duration between surgeries was 0.99 ± 0.02 and 6.35 ± 2.18 weeks, respectively. All accelerated athletes were each successfully matched to 2 athletes with unilateral procedures (N = 182). All 3 groups demonstrated significant improvement from baseline across all PROs (P <.001 for all). Acquired change in PROs was similar and not significantly different between groups (P >.05). Satisfaction with relief from pain was achieved by 85.9% of patients in the accelerated group compared with 83.1% in the delayed group (P =.053) and 87.3% in the unilateral group (P =.933). The minimal clinically important difference for the modified Harris Hip Score was achieved by 84.9% of patients in the accelerated group compared with 91.5% in the delayed group (P =.212) and 87.6% in the unilateral group (P =.456). At 2 years postoperatively, the continue-to-play rate was 73.6% for the accelerated group compared with 77.1% for the delayed group (P =.577) and 73.0% for the unilateral group (P =.903). There were no increased complications associated with the accelerated group. Conclusion: Accelerated bilateral hip arthroscopy 1 week apart was a safe and effective treatment option for athletes with bilateral symptoms. Improvement in PROs and continue-to-play rates were comparable with those after a delayed duration between procedures and with those case-control matched athletes undergoing unilateral arthroscopy. © 2023 The Author(s).",athletes; bilateral; femoroacetabular impingement; hip arthroscopy; staged surgery,Arthroscopy; Cohort Studies; Femoracetabular Impingement; Follow-Up Studies; Hip Joint; Humans; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; arthroscopy; cohort analysis; femoroacetabular impingement; follow up; hip; human; patient-reported outcome; procedures; retrospective study; treatment outcome,"""Hip Arthroscopy: Procedures, Outcomes, and Associated Technologies""",Hip Arthroscopy and Outcomes Analysis,Hip Arthroscopy Outcomes and Rehabilitation

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of AT to restricting excessive frontal plane ankle movements in semi-professional basketball players throughout the training session. DESIGN AND SETTING: A cross-sectional study was performed at the Universidad Europea de Madrid. METHODS: Forty male and female semi-professional basketball players were divided into two groups. The ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM) and interlimb asymmetries in a weight-bearing lunge position were evaluated at four time points: 1) with no tape, 2) before practice, at 30 min of practice, and 3) immediately after practice. RESULTS: In male basketball players, no differences were observed in the right and left ankles between the baseline and 30 min and between baseline and 90 min of assessment. In female athletes, significant differences were reported between baseline and pre-training assessments for the right ankle and also significant differences between baseline and 90 min in both ankles. CONCLUSIONS: Ankle taping effectively decreased the ankle dorsiflexion ROM in male and female basketball players immediately after application. However, ROM restriction was very low after 30 and 90 min, as assessed in a single basketball practice. Therefore, the classic taping method should be revised to develop new prophylactic approaches, such as the implementation of semi-rigid bracing techniques or the addition of active stripes during training or game pauses. © 2024, Associacao Paulista de Medicina.

Currently, no bibliometric studies have jointly analyzed KOA and the meniscus. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive analysis of the knowledge structure of KOA and the meniscus across two decades and to identify the emerging research trends from a bibliometric perspective. Methods: All articles reporting KOA and the meniscus from 2001 to 2021 were obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection. R software, CiteSpace, VOS Viewer, and Microsoft Excel were used to analyze the publications including the authors, cited authors, journals, cited journals, country of research, institutions, and research focus. These data were used to generate visual knowledge maps of the outputs. Results: A total of 3,218 articles were retrieved. Guermazi was identified as the author who had contributed the most to the field and Osteoarthritis and Cartilage was identified as the most productive research journal. The United States is the global leader in the field and the center for international cooperation with less international collaboration occurring in Eastern Asia. Boston University was the most prolific institution.

Achilles tendon healing is a complex process, and so far, there is no successful long-term solution to Achilles tendinopathy in the field of microsurgery due to its poor natural regeneration ability. Limitations in understanding the pathogenesis of Achilles tendon development and Achilles tendon injury hinder clinical treatment developments. There is an increasing demand for innovative conservative treatments that can improve Achilles tendon injury. In this study, a Sprague–Dawley rat model of Achilles tendinopathy was established. Lentiviral vectors that interfere with the expression of FOXD2-AS1, miR-21-3p, or PTEN were injected every 3 days. Rats were euthanized after 3 weeks, and the effect of FOXD2-AS1, miR-21-3p, or PTEN on Achilles tendon healing was analyzed by histological observation, biomechanical test, and examinations of inflammatory factors and tendon markers. As measured, downregulating FOXD2-AS1 or upregulating miR-21-3p improved histological structure, suppressed inflammation, promoted the expression of tendon markers, and optimized the biomechanical properties of Achilles tendon. Upregulating PTEN was capable of reversing the promoting effect of inhibition of FOXD2-AS1 on Achilles tendon healing. As concluded, deficiency of FOXD2-AS1 accelerates the healing of Achilles tendon injury and improves tendon degeneration by regulating the miR-21-3p/PTEN axis and promoting the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. © 2023, The Author(s).",Achilles tendinopathy; Inflammatory response; Long noncoding RNA FOXD2-AS1; microRNA-21-3p; PI3K/AKT signaling pathway; PTEN,"Achilles Tendon; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; MicroRNAs; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; RNA, Long Noncoding; Tendinopathy; long untranslated RNA; microRNA; mirn21 microRNA, rat; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; achilles tendon; animal; cell proliferation; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; rat; Sprague Dawley rat; tendinitis; tumor cell line","""Achilles Tendinopathy and Musculoskeletal Ultrasound Studies in Sport Medicine""",Achilles Tendon Health & Rehabilitation Research,Advances in Tissue Regeneration and Healing in Musculoskeletal Disorders

Netball is a sport that involves multiplane- and multidirectional landings, which results in a high proportion of injuries, particularly to the ankle joint. The purpose of this study was to analyse the ankle kinematics in multiple planes during multidirectional single-leg landings in high-level netball players. A total of ten (n = 10) netball players voluntarily participated in the study. All netball players performed 25 single-leg jump landing maneuvers per leg (dominant and non-dominant) from a 0.30 m high platform, landing onto a 0.70 m away force plate platform. Their ankle kinematic, landing kinetic and time to stabilisation (TTS) data were collected in sagittal-, frontal- and transverse planes. Netball players showed mean differences in peak landing forces (F (8,91) = 2.68, p = 0.009) but not in TTS (F (8,91) = 2.27, p = 0.260). There was evidence of differences in ankle kinematics across all three planes [Sagittal: (F (9,81) = 3.48, p = 0.001); Frontal: (F (9,81) = 8.01, p < 0.001); Transverse: (F (9,81) = 8.80, p < 0.001)]. Furthermore, small to large negative (r = −0.55) correlations were observed between ankle range of motion (ROM) and peak landing forces. Associated landing forces can be moderated by greater sagittal plane ankle ROM during multidirectional landings to minimise the risk of ankle injuries in netball. © 2023 by the authors.",ground reaction forces; multi-directional; stability; team sport,,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Effects of different training methods on athletic performance and injury prevention

However, few studies have examined the correlates of PALs in this population during the pandemic. This study aimed to evaluate the residence-specific correlates of PALs in elderly people from Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina during the COVID-19 pandemic. The participants were 211 persons older than 65 years (101 females), of whom 111 were community-dwelling residents, and 110 were nursing home residents (71.11 ± 3.11 and 72.22 ± 4.01 years of age, respectively; t-test = 0.91, p < 0.05). The variables included health status, residential status sociodemographic factors, anthropometrics (body mass, height, and body mass index), and PAL. PAL was evaluated using a translated version of the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE), and was validated in this study. PASE showed good test–retest reliability (51% of the common variance) and validity (57% of the common variance, with the step count measured using pedometers). Apart from participants’ health status and age, PAL was positively correlated with (i) community-dwelling residence (OR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.60–2.23), and (ii) a lower BMI (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.71–0.98). The pre-pandemic physical activity was positively correlated with the PAL of the nursing home residents (OR = 1.2, 95% CI: 1.02–1.45). A higher education level was positively correlated with the PAL of community-dwelling residents (OR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.04–1.66). This study evidenced the residence-specific correlates of PALs, and enabled the identification of specific groups that are at risk of having low PALs during the pandemic. Future studies examining this problem during a non-pandemic period are warranted. © 2024 by the authors.",lifestyle medicine; lock down; physical activity; physical literacy; residence status,,"""Impacts of COVID-19 on Physical and Mental Health, Exercise Habits, and Rehabilitation Strategies""","Impact of COVID-19 on Health, Physical Activity and Quality of Life",Post-COVID-19 Syndrome and Rehabilitation Strategies

Second, to determine risk factors for revision surgery. Methods: Prospectively collected data from two high-volume hip arthroscopy centers were retrospectively reviewed on adolescents (≤19 years old) who underwent primary hip arthroscopy between November 2008 and February 2019. Adolescents with a minimum 2-year follow-up for the modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), Non-Arthritic Hip Score (NAHS), Hip Outcome Score-Sports Specific Subscale (HOS-SSS), International Hip Outcome Tool-12 (iHOT-12), and visual analog scale (VAS) for pain were included regardless of their growth plate status. Exclusion criteria were Tönnis grade >1, lateral center edge-angle <18°, and previous ipsilateral hip surgery or conditions. Preoperative and postoperative radiographic data, MCID, PASS, MOI, secondary surgeries, and complications were reported. A multivariable survival analysis for risk factors for secondary surgery was conducted. Results: A total of 287 hips (249 patients) were included (74.9% females). The mean values for age, body mass index, and follow-up were 16.3 ± 1.3 years, 22.3 ± 3.5, and 26.6 ± 9.4 months, respectively. Further, 88.9% underwent labral repair, 81.5% femoroplasty, and 85.4% capsular closure. Improvement for all PROs was reported (P < .001) with high patient satisfaction (8.8 ± 1.5). Achievement for the MCID was 71.7%, 83.0%, 68.1%, and 79.5% for the mHHS, NAHS, HOS-SSS, and iHOT-12, respectively. Achievement for the PASS was 68.3% for the mHHS and 73.2% for the NAHS. The MOI for mHHS, NAHS, and VAS was 58.3%, 77.0%, and 59.6%, respectively. Rates of revision hip arthroscopy, cam recurrence, and heterotopic ossification were 5.8%, 1.7%, and 5.5%, respectively. Acetabular retroversion was found to be a risk factor for revision surgery (P = .03). Conclusion: The results of this multi-center study demonstrated that adolescents who underwent primary hip arthroscopy for FAIS reported significant improvement in all PROs, with satisfactory achievement rates for the MCID, PASS, MOI, and high patient satisfaction at a minimum 2-year follow-up.

Due to the high demands of sprint speed and power output in elite sprinters and jumpers, sprint and jump coaches are likely to have great knowledge on this topic. Undoubtedly, this expertise is even more pronounced for Olympic coaches, who work with some of the fastest and most powerful athletes in the world, and who are required to continually maintain these athletes at optimal performance levels. Describing and discussing the practices commonly adopted by these coaches in detail and extrapolating this experience to other sport coaching contexts and disciplines may be extremely relevant.

We believe that the FTSST has the potential to be a straightforward, low cost and valuable tool for identifying muscle disability and functional status following critical illness. The aim of our study was to establish the applicability, safety, and psychometric qualities of FTSST in patients at Intensive Care Unit (ICU) discharge. Methods: In our study applicability was determined by assessing the percentage of patients who could perform the test at ICU discharge. Safety was assessed by examining data regarding any exacerbated haemodynamic and respiratory responses or adverse events associated with the test. For assessing FTSST reliability, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), standard error of measurement (SEM) and Bland-Altman plot were used. For assessing concurrent validity handgrip strength, ICU length of stay, duration of invasive ventilation, Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 (SAPS3) and age variables were used. For investigating predictive validity, correlations between the FTSST and measures of hospital length of stay and functional independence were evaluated. Results: Only 30% of ICU survivors (n = 261 out of 817) were eligible to perform the FTSST and 7% of patients who performed the test (n = 10 out of 142) presented adverse events. Both inter (ICC 0.92 CI95% 0.89–0.94) and intra-rater (ICC 0.95 CI95% 0.93–0.96) reliability were excellent and higher scores were associated with lower muscle strength, longer hospital stay and greater functional impairment at hospital discharge in adult survivors of critical diseases. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the FTSST may be applicable only to high-functioning critical care survivors. In this specifical population, FTSST is a safe, easy to perform, valid and reliable measure that can be applied to fall risk and functional recovery management. © 2022, The Author(s).",Five Times Sit-to-Stand Test (FTSST); ICU; Physical therapy; Rehabilitation,,"""Physical Activity, Fitness, and Health Studies in Children and Adolescents""",Physical Activity and Its Effects on Health and Well-being in Children and Adolescents,Evaluation and Improvement of Postural Balance and Muscle Strength

All the patients filled out the WOSI with an interval of two weeks to assess reliability. The shortened Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (Quick-DASH), Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), and the 36-Item Short-Form Survey (SF-36) were assessed to evaluate construct validity. In order to assess responsiveness patients filled out WOSI before and after the physiotherapy and global rating of change scale at last session of physiotherapy. Reliability was assessed by intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC (1,2)), construct validity by two tailed Pearson (r), and responsiveness by longitudinal validity and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis. Results: The ICC (1,2) was 0.90 and correlation analysis revealed high level of correlation with: Quick-DASH (r = 0.82); SPADI (r = 0.72); physical SF-36 (r = −0.52); and mental SF-36 (r = −0.48).

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare short-term clinical and radiological results of three surgical treatment options for these patients. Methods: A multicenter randomized trial was conducted. Sixty-nine patients were randomly assigned to receive 1. subacromial decompression (Group SAD), 2. debridement of calcifications (Group D), or 3. debridement of calcifications with SAD (Group D + SAD). Stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria were used. The primary outcome was an improvement in VAS for pain (pVAS) 6 months postoperatively. Secondary outcomes were an improvement in pVAS 6 weeks postoperatively, functional outcomes (CMS, DASH, ASES), radiological outcome, additional treatments, and complications. Results: The improvement in pVAS was significant in all groups (p < 0.001) and did not differ between the groups after 6 months. Six weeks postoperatively, the improvement in pVAS was significantly (p = 0.03) less in Group SAD compared to Group D + SAD (16.5 mm, SD 19.3 mm vs 33.1 mm, SD 19.7 mm, respectively). The mean size of calcifications decreased significantly in all groups (p < 0.0001). In Group SAD, the size of the calcifications decreased less (p = 0.04) compared to Group D and Group D + SAD after 6 weeks. Group SAD received more additional treatments (p = 0.003) compared to Group D + SAD (9 vs 1), which were mainly subacromial cortisone injections. Conclusions: All patient groups showed significant pain relief and an improvement in shoulder function 6 months after surgery. However, patients in Group SAD showed inferior pain relief and less improvement in DASH score after 6 weeks. Furthermore, this group required more postoperative additional treatments. No significant differences in clinical and radiological outcomes were observed between patients in Group D compared to Group D + SAD. Therefore, an arthroscopic debridement without subacromial decompression seems to be advisable for patients with therapy-resistant calcifying tendinitis of the shoulder.

Methods: In a prospective multicenter-controlled trial, patients aged between 18 and 50 years, with single symptomatic focal cartilage defects between 1 and 4 cm2 (mean 2.6 ± 0.8, median 2.75, range 1.44–5.00) in the knee were randomized to treatment with ACI with spheroids (n = 52) or microfracture (n = 50). Primary clinical outcome was assessed by the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Analyses were performed in a defined hierarchical manner where outcomes of ACI were first compared to baseline values followed by a comparison to the microfracture group with repeated-measures ANCOVA with a non-inferiority approach. Subgroup analyses were performed to investigate the influence of age and defect size on the overall KOOS. Secondary clinical outcomes were the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART), modified Lysholm score and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) examination form. Safety data focused on adverse events. Here the 5 years results are presented at which there were 33 observed cases in the ACI group and 30 in the microfracture group. Results: The overall KOOS and its five subscores were significantly improved compared to baseline for both the ACI and microfracture group. Non-inferiority of ACI to microfracture was confirmed for the overall KOOS and the subscores, while for the subscores activities of daily living, quality of life and sports and recreation of the threshold for superiority was passed. In the ACI group, a notably more rapid initial improvement of the KOOS was found at three months for the older age group compared to the younger age group and the microfracture group. No other differences were found based on age or defect size. In addition, clinical improvement was found for the MOCART, modified Lysholm and IKDC examination form both the ACI and microfracture group. No safety concern related to either treatment was observed. Conclusion: This study confirms the safety and efficacy of matrix-associated ACI with spheroids at a mid to long-term follow-up. Non-inferiority of ACI to microfracture was confirmed for the overall KOOS and all subscores, while superiority was reached for the subscores activities of daily living, quality of life and sports and recreation in the ACI group. This underlines the importance of ACI for the young and active patients.

Nevertheless, the nature of the operational processes implemented by practitioners within clubs and national federations remains unexplored. The aim of the present study, therefore, was to survey elite youth professional football academies from around the world regarding the operational processes adopted by their medical and performance units. Methods: Of the 50 organizations invited, 10 national federations and 25 clubs took part in the survey resulting in a response rate of 70% (95% confidence interval, 56%−81%). The respondents represented three groups: senior club and academy management, performance, and medical staff. Results: The majority (60%−90%) of clubs and national federations reported strategic alignment between senior and academy medical and performance units as well as between academy medical and performance units. Survey responses indicated substantial heterogeneity in the composition and number of medical and performance professionals employed in academies. The majority of respondents agreed their medical and performance departments were effective in utilizing staff knowledge and external sources of knowledge to inform their practice (56%−80%). Performance staff (40%−50%) and physiotherapists (30%−32%) were deemed most influential in injury prevention programmes. During the return-to-play process, the influence of specific practitioners in the medical and performance units was dependent upon the phase of return-to-play. Shared decision-making was common practice amongst performance and medical staff in injury prevention and return-to-play processes. Medical and performance data were generally centralized across the first team and academy in majority (50%−72%) of clubs and national federations. Data were integrated within the same data management system to a higher degree in clubs (68%) vs. national federations (40%). Research and development activity were reported for most academies (50%−72%), and generally led by the head of performance (37%) or team doctor (21%). Research activities were largely undertaken via internal staff (~100%), academic collaborations (50%−88%) and/or external consultants and industry partnerships (77%−83%) in the national federation and clubs. Conclusion: Collectively, these findings provide a detailed overview regarding key operational processes delivered by medical and performance practitioners working in elite football academies.

Still, little is known about physiotherapists’ use, perceptions and needs with regards to telerehabilitation services. Aims: To describe physiotherapists use and perceptions of, as well as needs for, telerehabilitation services for the rehabilitation of people with neurological diseases or older adults in Sweden. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, an author-created survey was sent out to members of the Swedish Association of Physiotherapists including questions about the use and perceptions of existing telerehabilitation services (e.g. telephone, internet-based applications and mobile applications) as well as needs of future telerehabilitation services. The results were presented descriptively as numbers and percentages. Results: Three hundred seven physiotherapists were included in this study with 139 (45%) treating people with neurological diseases and 168 (55%) treating older adults. Most respondents did not provide telerehabilitation before (74%) or during (51%) the COVID-19 pandemic. Telephone, which was predominantly used for administrative tasks, was the most frequent utilised ICT used by 68% of the physiotherapist using ICTs several days/week. Few respondents used internet-based applications (12%), mobile applications (3%) or SMS services (8%) and videoconferencing (3%). A majority of the respondents were interested in ICT (78%), felt comfortable using ICT (57%) and were interested in learning how ICT can be used in rehabilitation (92%). Still, few respondents perceived that people with neurological diseases or older adults can use existing ICTs for rehabilitation purposes (18%) and that existing reimbursement system within health care facilitates remote rehabilitation (16%). Important functionality of future ICT perceived by physiotherapists covered patient communication (e.g. chat, SMS and video), assessments (e.g. digital surveys and assessment of physical activity) and treatment (e.g. exercise prescription). Conclusion: While physiotherapists had an overall positive perception to use and willingness to learn about telerehabilitation, few used telerehabilitation services before nor during the COVID-19 pandemic and they also perceived multilevel barriers for implementation, ranging from patients ability to use ICT to existing reimbursement systems within health care. Our findings emphasize the need to strengthen the expertise regarding remote services among physiotherapists. © 2022, The Author(s).",COVID-19 pandemic; Information and Communication Technology; Perceptions; Physiotherapists; Telerehabilitation,Aged; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Nervous System Diseases; Pandemics; Physical Therapists; Surveys and Questionnaires; Sweden; Telerehabilitation; aged; cross-sectional study; epidemiology; human; neurologic disease; pandemic; physiotherapist; questionnaire; Sweden; telerehabilitation,"""Impacts of COVID-19 on Physical and Mental Health, Exercise Habits, and Rehabilitation Strategies""","Impact of COVID-19 on Health, Physical Activity and Quality of Life",Management and Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

This study identified and analyzed lowerextremity biomechanical asymmetries in college women's volleyball players during standard and sport-specific double-leg landing tasks. Design: Cross-sectional laboratory study. Methods: Eighteen female college volleyball players were analyzed using standard 3D motion capture techniques during a drop vertical jump and an unanticipated lateral reactive jump task. Repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance identified asymmetries in kinematic and kinetic variables of each task. Results: Average symmetry indices ranged from 9.3% to 31.3% during the drop vertical jump and 11.9% to 25.6% during the reactive jump task. During the drop vertical jump, the dominant limb exhibited lower knee abduction moments (P = .03), ankle dorsiflexion moments (P = .02), ankle eversion moments (P = .003) and vertical ground reaction forces (P = .03), and greater ankle inversion moments (P = .001). Both kinematic (λ = 0.27, P = .03) and kinetic (λ = 0.12, P = .008) asymmetries were identified during the reactive jump task. The dominant limb exhibited greater peak knee flexion (P = .003) and ankle dorsiflexion (P = .02) angles, and greater ankle dorsiflexion (P = .005) and inversion (P = .03) moments than the nondominant limb. Conclusions: These asymmetries observed during double-leg landing tasks may predispose volleyball athletes to unilaterally higher ground reaction or muscle forces and ultimately a greater risk of injury during landing.  © 2023 Human Kinetics, Inc.",biomechanics; injury risk; jumping; performance,Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Knee Joint; Leg; Lower Extremity; Volleyball; anterior cruciate ligament injury; biomechanics; cross-sectional study; female; human; injury; knee; leg; lower limb; physiology; volleyball,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Effects of different training methods on athletic performance and injury prevention

The purpose of this paper is to present the process evaluation of a text messaging health promotion intervention for mining shift workers during a 24-day shift cycle. Data collected from intervention participants with a logbook (n = 25) throughout the intervention, exit interviews (n = 7) and online surveys (n = 17) examined the WHPP using the RE-AIM (Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance) framework. The program reached 66% of workers across three departments, with 15% of participants dropping out. The program showed the potential to be adopted if the recruitment strategies are improved to reach more employees, especially when involving work managers for recruitment. A few changes were made to the program, and participant adherence was high. Facilitators to adopt and implement the health promotion program included the use of text messaging to improve physical activity, feedback on behaviour, and providing incentives. Work-related fatigue was reported as a barrier to implementing the program. Participants reported that they would recommend the program to other workers and use the Mi fitness band to continue monitoring and improving their health behaviour. This study showed that shift workers were optimistic about health promotion. Allowing for long-term evaluation and involving the company management to determine scale-up should be considered for future programs. © 2023 by the authors.",physical activity; process evaluation; RE-AIM; shift work; workplace health promotion,Exercise; Feasibility Studies; Health Promotion; Humans; Occupational Health; Program Evaluation; Text Messaging; Workplace; feasibility study; mobile communication; physical activity; public health; workplace; adoption; adult; Article; biofeedback; clinical evaluation; conceptual framework; controlled study; dropping out; ecological momentary assessment; employee; fatigue; feasibility study; female; fitness; health care delivery; health program; health promotion; health survey; hospital service; human; incentive; information processing; interview; long term evaluation; male; manager; mining; monitoring; online system; physical activity; process evaluation; reach; Reach Efficacy Adoption Implementation and Maintenance framwork; recruitment; rotating shift; scale up; shift worker; text messaging; work related fatigue; workplace health promotion program; exercise; health promotion; occupational health; program evaluation; workplace,"""Physical Activity and Health Outcomes in Aging Populations""",Physical Activity and Health in Older Adults,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Corticosteroid injection is the mainstay of treatment for those patients who do not respond to conservative management. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a currently used strategy in the clinical practice to provide a regenerative stimulus for tendon healing. Objective: To evaluate the effects of Platelet-rich plasma in the treatment of DQVD in comparison with corticosteroid (CS) injection. Materials and Methods: The present randomized clinical trial had been conducted in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Shahbag, Dhaka. A total of 100 patients with pain and swelling over the radial aspect of the wrist with positive Finkelstein test were randomly allocated into three groups: group A (received platelet-rich plasma injection), group B (received corticosteroid injection) and group C (received conservative management). The severity of pain and functional status of the wrist joint were recorded according to VAS and Mayo’s wrist score both pre-procedurally on day 0 and post-procedurally at the end of 1st, 3rd and 6th month. Results: The mean age of the participants in group A, B and C were 45.6 (±10.4), 46.9 (±11.3) and 42.4 (±6.3) years respectively. In all groups, majority of the study participants were female and housewives. No significant statistical difference was observed among the groups regarding VAS scores and Mayo’s Wrist Scores at baseline. At the end of 6 months, the reduction of pain in group A was significantly lower than group B (p<0.001). Again, at the end of 6 months, the improvement of Mayo’s Wrist Scores in group A group was significantly higher than group B (p<0.001). In group A, 77.8% reduction of pain score was achieved while in group B, 68.4% reduction of pain score was achieved after 6 month of treatment (p<0.001).

Methods: A literature search on Web of Science was performed to determine the 50 most cited studies on the topic of PTS in joint preserving knee surgery between 1990 and 2022. The studies were evaluated for their bibliographic parameters, level of evidence rating (LOE), citation counts, the Modified Coleman Methodological Score (MCMS), the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS), and the Radiologic Methodology and Quality Scale (MQCSRE). Results: Of the top 50 list, 16 studies were published in the American Journal of Sports Medicine. A total of 23 studies were produced in the United States (46%). Of 10 different study types, case control studies (n = 16, 32%) and cadaveric studies (n = 10, 20%) were most common. 15 studies (30%) were purely radiological studies. 6 studies were level II (12%), 23 level III (46%), 15 level IV (30%), and 6 level V studies (12%), respectively. The number of citations ranged from 42 to 447 (mean 105.6 ± 79.2 citations) and showed a mean citation density of 10.3 ± 5.2, composed of the decades 1994 – 2000 (8.3 ± 4.1), 2001 – 2010 (11.1 ± 5.9), 2011 – 2019 (10.1 ± 5.1). Mean quality scores were 55.9 ± 13.0 for MCMS (n = 18), 14.5 ± 3.2 for MINORS (n = 18) and 18.1 ± 3.7 for MQCSRE (n = 20), respectively. High citation counts did not correlate with higher study quality scores (p > 0.05). Radiological studies were not significantly cited more often than non-radiological studies (mean 116.9 ± 88.3 vs. 100.8 ± 75.8 citations; p > 0.05). Conclusion: In joint preserving knee surgery, the 50 most cited studies on PTS did not represent a ranking of the highest methodological quality scores. Citation counts and citation density over the past three decades did not significantly differ, even though the number of articles in the presented list multiplied over the same period.

Methods: Between October 2010 and December 2014, patients who underwent arthroscopic measurement of mobility of the PHLM were identified. The Sakai classification was used to classify aiPMF and psPMF on MRI into the following 3 types: type A, the fascicle was depicted with obvious continuity and with a low-intensity band; type B, depicted with continuity but with an ambiguous intensity structure; and type C, depicted with discontinuity or not visible. Magnetic resonance images of the piPMF and MFibL were evaluated as presence or absence. The mobility of the PHLM was measured arthroscopically at traction forces of 10 and 20 N. Results: A total of 73 patients (47 men, mean age 41.8 ± 19.3 years) were included. Multivariate regression analyses revealed aiPMF type C and psPMF types B and C to be independent factors associated with mobility at both traction forces, and CLS was an independent factor at a traction force of 20 N. Compared with that of type A, the increased mobility of aiPMF type C was 5.0 mm (P = .019) and 5.6 mm (P = .011) at 10 and 20 N, respectively; the increased mobility of psPMF type B was 2.5 mm (P = .007) and 3.5 mm (P = .0003), respectively; and the increased mobility of psPMF type C was 3.3 mm (P = .021) and 3.6 mm (P = .014), respectively. The increased mobility associated with CLS was 3.5 mm at 20 N (P = .022). Conclusions: Anterior displacement of the PHLM induced by an external traction force at 90° of flexion of the knee joint was associated with abnormal MRI findings of the anteroinferior popliteomeniscal fascicle and posterosuperior popliteomeniscal fascicle, as well as a history of catching or locking symptoms. Clinical Relevance: Understanding signs and symptoms and associated pathology in patients with symptomatic anterior mobility of the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus may help guide best treatment. © 2024 The Authors",,,"""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction and Outcome Factors

These fractures occur in a bimodal distribution, most commonly after high-energy trauma in young males or ground level falls in elderly females. Open reduction and internal fixation with a variety of implants and exposure techniques is a mainstay of treatment for displaced fractures, while non- or minimally- displaced fractures may be treated nonoperatively. Operative management has expanded to include novel arthroscopic and open approaches, such as surgical dislocation of the elbow. Rarely, in elderly patients with severe comminution, total elbow arthroplasty may be the best option.

Although multiple intracellular mechanisms are involved, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been demonstrated to play a significant role in the genesis and progression. Most of the research supports the advantages of exercise for NAFLD. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism(s) that underpin the effectiveness of exercise training in NAFLD. This study aimed to identify how aerobic exercise affected hepatic ER stress in a mouse NAFLD model. In this study, the mice were fed either a standard diet (SD) or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 17 weeks. HFD mice were trained on a treadmill during the last eight weeks. All animals were tested for serum levels of biochemical assays, protein expression, and gene expression. The hematoxylin and eosin, Oil red O, and immunohistochemistry staining were also performed. The results indicated that a high-fat diet generated NAFLD, with serum lipid disruption and hepatic function impairment, and increased GRP78 and ATF6 expressions. However, aerobic training reversed the majority of these alterations. It is concluded that NAFLD appears to be associated with hepatic ER stress response, and aerobic exercise mitigates NAFLD via lowering ER stress proteins GRP78 and ATF6. © 2022 Chengdu Sport University",ATF6; Endoplasmic reticulum stress; Exercise; GRP78; Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,activating transcription factor 6; endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP; heat shock protein; aerobic exercise; animal experiment; animal model; Article; controlled study; disease exacerbation; endoplasmic reticulum stress; gene expression; histopathology; immunohistochemistry; lipid diet; liver function; male; mouse; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonhuman; physiological stress; protein degradation; protein expression; protein folding; protein synthesis; real time polymerase chain reaction; treadmill exercise; unfolded protein response; Western blotting,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Impact of Exercise and Lifestyle Changes on Health Conditions

The study recruited 34 participants which were assigned into experimental (n=17) and control (n=17) groups. Age ranged between 16 and 32years (M age = 22.6years, SD = 1.47). The experimental group received 8 weeks mindfulness acceptance commitment (MAC) intervention program, while control group received no intervention. Participants completed Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), The Connor-Davidson Resilience scale (CD-RISC), Trait Sport Confidence Inventory (TSCI), Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) and Adapted Levenson Multidimensional Locus of control scales (ALMLC). Both groups completed the questionnaire at pre-test and post-test evaluation. Descriptive data employed mean and standard deviation, while Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) of Sӧrbom's method (alternative to analysis of covariance) was used for analysis of hypothesis. Finding of the study showed that there is significant direct and indirect effect of mindfulness acceptance commitment on resilience, self-confidence and emotion regulation on elite football players. The findings further showed that there is significant difference between the pre-test scores and post-test scores of intervention group and control group. The intervention group mean scores on resilience, self-confidence and emotion regulation are higher than the control group counterparts. This shows that MAC program is effective in increasing resilience, self-confidence and emotion regulation of elite football players concurrently which in turn could improve performance and attain success. © 2022",Emotion regulation; Locus of control; Mindfulness acceptance commitment; Resilience; Self-confidence,,"""Pain Management and Musculoskeletal Health in Various Populations""",Chronic Pain Management and Treatment Studies,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Eighty-two CHD patients performed, before and after a 3-month ECR, a cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) on a bike with gas exchanges measurments (VO2peak, minute ventilation; VE) and cardiac output (Qc). The arteriovenous difference in O2 (C(a-v¯)O2) and the alveolar capillary gradient in O2 (PAi-aO2) were calculated using Fick's laws. Oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES) was calculated. A 5.0% cut off was applied for differentiating non- (NR: ΔVO2<0.0%), low (LR: 0.0≤ ΔVO2<5.0%), moderate- (MR: 5.0≤ΔVO2<10.0%) and high responders (HR: ΔVO2≥10.0%) to ECR. Forty-four % of patients were HR (n=36), 20% MR (n=16), 23% LR (n=19) and 13% NR (n=11). For HR, the VO2peak increase (p<0.01) was associated to increases in VE (+12.8±13.0L/min, p<0.01), Qc (+1.0±0.9L/min, p<0.01), and C(a-v¯)O2 (+2.3±2.5mLO2/100mL, p<0.01).

Passive experiments differ from active experiments in that passive experiments involve limited or no active intervention to generate observations and test hypotheses. Experiments of nature and natural experiments are two types of passive experiments. Experiments of nature include research participants with rare genetic or acquired conditions that facilitate exploration of specific physiological mechanisms. In this way, experiments of nature are parallel to classical “knockout” animal models among human research participants. Natural experiments are gleaned from data sets that allow population-based questions to be addressed. An advantage of both types of passive experiments is that more extreme and/or prolonged exposures to physiological and behavioral stimuli are possible in humans. In this article, we discuss a number of key passive experiments that have generated foundational medical knowledge or mechanistic physiological insights related to exercise. Both natural experiments and experiments of nature will be essential to generate and test hypotheses about the limits of human adaptability to stressors like exercise. © American Physiological Society.",,Animals; Exercise; Humans; United States; animal; exercise; human; United States,"""Analysis of Biomechanics, Exercise Techniques, and Physiological Adaptations in Various Physical Activities""",Lower Limb Muscle Strength and Biomechanics Studies,Physiological and Biomechanical Responses in Sports Performance

The objective of the study is to create a Smartphone app with a perioperative care program, implement it in a group of patients scheduled for a thoracic surgical procedure, and evaluates its use. Methods: A prospective and descriptive study. We created a Smartphone app (Fissios App) which contains 40 perioperative recommendations and 10 chest physical exercises. Patients were recommended to use it before and after surgery; to measure its use, we created and applied a questionnaire. A descriptive analysis of patient variables and questionnaire responses was performed and their association evaluated. Results: One hundred fourpatients were included, the 60.3% were men with a median age of 62 years (51-71), and 26.72% had completed high school. The 89.3% of patients highlighted the ease of downloading and setting up the app. More than 90% of patients positively assessed clarity in explaining chest physical exercises and perioperative recommendations. One hundred four (79.4%) patients highlighted the contribution of the use of the app during the preoperative period to face the postoperative period. Conclusions: We created a Smartphone app (Fissios App) with a perioperative care program and it was successfully implemented regardless of the age or educational level of patients. The tool clearly explains the information contained and the patients reported that its use before surgery helped them to face the postoperative period, with an appropriate level of physical demand and time of use. © 2022 AEC",Breathing exercises; Mobile applications; Perioperative care; Postoperative complications; Preoperative exercise; Surveys and questionnaires,,"""Hip Arthroscopy: Procedures, Outcomes, and Associated Technologies""",Hip Arthroscopy and Outcomes Analysis,Wearable Devices and Techniques in Gait Analysis and Mobility Rehabilitation

We aimed to assess relationships between key patient-reported outcomes, in line with a biopsychosocial approach, and returning to preinjury sport at 12 months after ACL injury treated without reconstruction. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that biopsychosocial factors would be associated with returning to preinjury sport at 12 months after ACL injury. Study Design: Prospective single cohort study. Level of Evidence: Level 2. Methods: Patients who had an ACL injury and did not have reconstruction during the first year after injury were recruited from healthcare clinics in Sweden, and followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months after injury. Return to preinjury sport at 12 months was the primary outcome. Explanatory variables were psychological readiness to return to sport, knee-related quality of life, and self-reported knee function. Using generalized estimating equations, we evaluated the relationships between the explanatory variables and the primary outcome at each timepoint. Results: Data were analyzed for 88 participants with a median age of 27 years (15-40 years). Soccer was the most frequently reported preinjury sport (n = 22). Forty participants (46%) had returned to their preinjury sport at 12 months after ACL injury. The odds of returning to preinjury sport at 12 months increased with higher self-reported knee function at 6 months (odds ratio [OR], 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0-1.1), and the odds of being returned to the preinjury sport at 12 months doubled for every 1-point increase (1-10 scale) in psychological readiness to return to sport measured at 12 months (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2-3.2). Conclusion: Superior self-reported knee function at 6 months and greater psychological readiness to return to sport at 12 months were associated with returning to the preinjury sport 1 year after ACL injury treated without reconstruction.

To determine the effects of strength exercise interventions on the accomplishment of activities of daily living (ADLs), motor performance, and PA in children with leukemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma, we randomly allocated patients (4–18 years) immediately after diagnosis into two exercise groups. Methods: The intervention group (IG; n = 21) received a specific strength training combined with a standard care exercise program, whereas the control group (CG; n = 20) was provided standard care exercise program without any targeted muscle strengthening. After the baseline visit, participants were followed-up three times until intensive treatment cessation. We assessed physical function limitations using the Activities Scale for Kids© (ASK) and Functional ADL Screen. Secondary outcomes were PA levels using accelerometer and motor performance as measured by MOON-test (motor performance in pediatric oncology-test). Results: In both groups, ADL accomplishment had significantly increased (p < 0.05). However, no significant between-group differences for ASK outcome were noted. Motor performance was reduced in all motor abilities. Conclusions: Both exercise interventions were effective to maintain ADLs and motor performance during intensive treatment. In comparison, regular strength exercise interventions in the course of therapy tended to be more beneficial with regards to muscular explosive and endurance strength. 2022 Gaser, Peters, Oberhoffer-Fritz, Götte, Feuchtinger, Schmid, Haller, von Luettichau and Kesting.",accelerometry; childhood cancer; intensive treatment; motor skills; physical function; strength training; supervised exercise program,activities scale for kid; activity of daily living assessment; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; acute myeloid leukemia; adolescent; anthropometry; Article; cancer diagnosis; child; clinical article; clinical outcome; controlled study; daily life activity; female; follow up; functional adl screen; human; kinesiotherapy; leukemia; male; motor dysfunction assessment; motor performance; motor performance in pediatric oncology test; muscle training; nonhodgkin lymphoma; patient compliance; physical activity; randomized controlled trial; resistance training; self report; therapy effect,"""Physical Activity, Rehabilitation, and Health Outcomes in Medical Conditions""",Impact of Exercise and Rehabilitation on Quality of Life and Health in Patients,Exercise Programs and Physical Activity in Cancer Recovery

The resistance training of the muscles involved in the core is a new training theory applicable to modern sports that is gaining prominence due to its amazing results. It is of great value for researchers to integrate the strengths of core strengthening into soccer training, improve their protocols, and compensate for their limitations. Objective: This study aimed to analyze the relationship between core strength training and physical conditioning in soccer players. At the same time, this article discusses the influence of core muscle strength characteristics on athletes’ physical performance. Methods: This article selects advanced soccer players as research subjects. Volunteers were randomly divided into two groups (control and experimental groups). The experimental group received core muscle strength training, while the control group received daily training. This paper analyzed the muscle strength characteristics of the two groups of volunteers. Then, this paper conducts a statistical and mathematical analysis of the muscle strength level data in two groups of athletes. Results: The experimental group showed significant differences in bilateral hip and ankle joint flexors after core muscle strength training (P<0.01). The relative peak moment of flex-ion and extension of the left hip was lower than that of the right hip, a factor justified by the predominant motor laterality principle on the players. The muscle strength of the left knee and ankle joints was greater than that of the right. Both experimental and control groups showed that the strength of the ankle flexors was better than the ankle extensors (knee toe flexors). The data were very significantly different (P<0.01). Conclusion: Muscular endurance training can help improve the physical conditioning of soccer players. Athletes can reinforce core strength training in their daily training.

Ten healthy adults walked in an immobilizing boot under various heel wedge conditions (30°, 5°, 0°) and walking speeds. Three-dimensional motion capture, ground reaction force, and 6-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals were collected. We used a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to predict peak Achilles tendon load and walking speed. The effects of altering sensor parameters were also explored. Walking speed models (mean absolute percentage error (MAPE): 8.81 ± 4.29%) outperformed tendon load models (MAPE: 34.93 ± 26.3%). Models trained with subject-specific data performed better than models trained without subject-specific data. Removing the gyroscope, decreasing the sampling frequency, and using combinations of sensors did not change the usability of the models, having inconsequential effects on model performance. We developed a simple monitoring paradigm that uses LASSO regression and wearable sensors to accurately predict (MAPE ≤ 12.6%) Achilles tendon loading and walking speed while ambulating in an immobilizing boot. This paradigm provides a clinically implementable strategy to longitudinally monitor patient loading and activity while recovering from Achilles tendon injuries. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.",,Achilles Tendon; Adult; Biomechanical Phenomena; Gait; Humans; Machine Learning; Walking; Walking Speed; Wearable Electronic Devices; achilles tendon; adult; biomechanics; gait; human; machine learning; walking; walking speed,"""Application of Machine Learning and Biomechanics in Musculoskeletal Health and Wearable Devices""","Knee Assessment and Recovery: Validity, Reliability, and Clinical Trials",Wearable Devices and Techniques in Gait Analysis and Mobility Rehabilitation

Results: A total of 2072 girls enrolled in the study, and 468 participants (22.5%) sustained 549 injuries (TL = 71.6%, NTL = 28.4%) for an overall injury rate of 5.31 (95% CI = 4.89, 5.79) per 1000 athlete-exposures. The competition injury rate was greater than the practice injury rate for all injuries (injury rate ratio [IRR] = 1.19; 95% CI = 1.00, 1.41) and TL injuries (IRR = 1.31; 95% CI = 1.07, 1.60). Players with a previous musculoskeletal injury had a higher rate of TL than NTL injuries (IRR = 1.36; 95% CI = 1.12, 1.65). Ankle injuries accounted for the greatest proportion of TL injuries (n = 110, 28%), while the greatest proportion of NTL injuries occurred in the hand or fingers (n = 34, 22%). Ligament sprains accounted for 40% of TL injuries (n = 156), whereas muscle or tendon strains (n = 79, 51%) accounted for more than half of all NTL injuries. Conclusions: Although most injuries sustained by adolescent girls' volleyball athletes were TL in nature, nearly a third of all injuries were NTL injuries. Injury characteristics differed widely between TL and NTL injuries. Understanding the most common types and characteristics of injuries among high school volleyball players is critical for the development of effective injury-prevention programs. © the National Athletic Trainers' Association, Inc www.natajournals.org.",athlete; epidemiology; female athlete; sport,,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Effects of different training methods on athletic performance and injury prevention

Methods A cross-sectional validation study was carried out on 161 adults aged between 35 and 65, selected from a population-based study in Temuco, Chile. IPAQ-SF was completed twice, seven days apart, to analyze the test-retest reliability with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Objective PA was assessed by accelerometry (ActiGraph GT3X+) for seven consecutive days. Intraclass correlation coefficients were used to determine the reliability. Spearman correlation coefficients (rho) and Bland-Altman plots were calculated to assess validity. Results 144 subjects (52.5 ± 8.8 years, 53.9% men) answered the IPAQ-SF on both occasions and had valid accelerometry data. The IPAQ-SF showed moderate reliability for sitting time (ICC = 0.62), while it was poor for walking (ICC = 0.40), moderate PA (ICC = 0.41), vigorous PA (ICC = 0.48), and total PA (ICC = 0.33). There were weak correlations between IPAQ-SF and accelerometry for sedentary behavior (rho = 0.28, p = 0.0005), walking (rho = 0.11, p = 0.17), moderate PA (rho = 0.13, p = 0.128), vigorous PA (rho = 0.18, p = 0.03), and total PA (rho = 0.26, p = 0.002). Conclusions The results suggest that the IPAQ-SF test and retest would provide an acceptable measure of total SB and MVPA, and a weak correlation between IPAQ-SF and accelerometer.  © 2023 Balboa-Castillo et al.",,Adult; Aged; Chile; Cross-Sectional Studies; Exercise; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires; accelerometry; adult; anthropometry; Article; Chilean; concurrent validity; correlation coefficient; cross-sectional study; energy expenditure; female; human; human experiment; international physical activity questionnaire; international physical activity questionnaire short form; low intensity exercise; male; metabolic equivalent; moderate intensity exercise; nutritional status; physical activity; reliability; sedentary lifestyle; sitting; sociodemographics; test retest reliability; validation study; validity; waist circumference; walking; aged; Chile; exercise; middle aged; questionnaire; reproducibility,"""Physical Activity and Health Outcomes in Aging Populations""",Physical Activity and Health in Older Adults,Physical Activity and Health Risks

Establishing the noise: interday ecological reliability of countermovement jump variables in professional rugby union players. J Strength Cond Res 36(11): 3159-3166, 2022 - The purpose of this study was to examine the interday ""ecological"" reliability of a wide range of ground reaction force-derived countermovement jump (CMJ) variables. Thirty-six male, professional rugby union players performed 3 CMJs on 4 separate days over an 8-day period during the first week of preseason. We calculated reliability for 86 CMJ variables across 5 interday combinations using 2 criteria: mean output across 3 jump trials (Mean3) and single output from the highest jump (BestJH). Interday coefficient of variation (CV) of the 86 variables in each CMJ phase, for Mean3and BestJH, respectively, ranged between concentric = 2-11% and 2-13%; eccentric = 1-45% and 1-107%; and landing = 4-32% and 6-45%. Mean3interday CV was lower in all 86 variables across every interday combination, compared with BestJH. CVs were lower in our cohort than previous studies, particularly for eccentric phase variables. There was no meaningful difference between interday conditions, suggesting any 2-day combination conducted within the first 8 days of preseason, represents a measure of ""noise."" We did not apply arbitrary reliability ""cut-offs"" used in previous work (e.g., CV <10%); therefore, our analysis provides reference reliability for a wide range of CMJ variables. However, we recommend that practitioners assess reliability in their athletes, as it is likely to be environment, protocol, and cohort specific. © 2022 NSCA National Strength and Conditioning Association.

Hypothesis: Football players with FAI syndrome would report worse burden than other symptomatic players, with the effect partially mediated by cartilage defects and/or labral tears. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Level of Evidence: Level 4. Methods: Football (soccer and Australian football) players (n = 165; 35 women) with hip/groin pain (≥6 months and positive flexion–adduction–internal rotation test) were recruited. Participants completed 2 patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs; the International Hip Outcome Tool–33 [iHOT-33] and Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score [HAGOS]) and underwent hip radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). FAI syndrome was determined to be present when cam and/or pincer morphology were present. Cartilage defects and labral tears were graded as present or absent using MRI. Linear regression models investigated relationships between FAI syndrome (dichotomous independent variable) and PROM scores (dependent variables). Mediation analyses investigated the effect of cartilage defects and labral tears on these relationships. Results: FAI syndrome was not related to PROM scores (unadjusted b values ranged from −4.693 (P = 0.23) to 0.337 (P = 0.93)) and cartilage defects and/or labral tears did not mediate its effect (P = 0.22-0.97). Conclusion: Football players with FAI syndrome did not report worse burden than those with other causes of hip/groin pain. Cartilage defects and/or labral tears did not explain the effect of FAI syndrome on reported burden. Clinical Relevance: FAI syndrome, cartilage defects, and labral tears were prevalent but unrelated to reported burden in symptomatic football players. © 2022 The Author(s).",cam morphology; magnetic resonance imaging; patient-reported outcomes,Arthralgia; Australia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Femoracetabular Impingement; Football; Groin; Hip Joint; Humans; Pain; Self Report; Soccer; arthralgia; Australia; complication; cross-sectional study; diagnostic imaging; epidemiology; female; femoroacetabular impingement; football; hip; human; inguinal region; pain; self report; soccer,"""Hip Arthroscopy: Procedures, Outcomes, and Associated Technologies""",Hip Arthroscopy and Outcomes Analysis,Effects of Training Protocols on Injury Prevention and Performance in Soccer and Futsal Players

To achieve this outcome, however, a tailored training program is required; the normal military training curriculum is inadequate. The connection between cumulative weekly extracurricular training time, cumulative weekly extracurricular core training time and cadet performance is unknown. Methods: The association between cumulative weekly extracurricular training time, cumulative weekly extracurricular core training time and performance has been discovered using a descriptive epidemiological study methodology. Questionnaires were used to collect information on personal characteristics and weekly cumulative extracurricular (core) training time, as well as the results of the Chinese Army Physical Fitness Test (C-APFT), which included 100-m dash, 5000-m run, 3000-m armed training run, 400-m steeplechase, 800 m breaststroke, horizontal bar pull-ups, 2-min sit-ups, 2-min push-ups, and hand grenade throwing. This study recruited two hundred and twenty male cadets (aged 18 to 23 years, 19.68 ± 0.91) from a military medical university. Results: (a) The correlation between cumulative weekly extracurricular training time and C-APFT score is significant. The 100-m dash, 5000-m run, 3000-m armed training run, 400-m steeplechase, and 2-min push-ups performed the best when participants exercised for 5 to 10 h per week. (b) The number of cadets scoring good or excellent on the C-APFT improves with cumulative weekly extracurricular core training time. The recommended amount of core training for cadets per week is 120 min. (c) The average cumulative weekly extracurricular core training time was a effective predictor of performance on the 400-m steeplechase (R2 = 0.470, F = 10.641, P＜0.01), horizontal bar pull-ups (R2 = 0.238, F = 68.191, P＜0.01), 2-min sit-ups (R2 = 0.280, F = 84.710, P＜0.01), 100-m run (R2 = 0.031, F = 6.920, P＜0.01), 3000-m armed training run (R2 = 0.025, F = 5.603, P＜0.05), 2-min push-ups (R2 = 0.019, F = 4.295, P＜0.05), and hand grenade tossing (R2 = 0.025, F = 5.603, P＜0.05). Conclusions: Active participation in extracurricular core training can improve cadets' C-APFT scores. An average cumulative weekly extracurricular training duration of 5–10 h showed the most progress, and more than 120 min per week was ideal for extracurricular core training. The amount of extracurricular time spent on core training exercises each week can be used as a predictor of the C-APFT. © 2023 The Author(s)",Chinese army physical fitness test; Extracurricular training time; Military personnel; Physical conditioning; Physical education and training; Physical performance,,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Gender Differences in Musculoskeletal Health & Physical Fitness

This causes shoulder complaints and overuse injuries. While eccentric training for the lower extremity shows preventive effects by improving strength, range of motion and fascicle length, there is a research gap for the shoulder joint and for advanced tissue characterization using diffusion tensor imaging. Objectives: To investigate the effects of 6-week eccentric isokinetic resistance training on strength, flexibility, and fiber architecture characteristics of the external rotators compared to an active control group in junior male handball players. Methods: 15 subjects were randomly assigned to the eccentric training group and 14 subjects to the active control group (conventional preventive training). Primary outcome measures were eccentric and concentric isokinetic strength of the external rotators, range of motion, and muscle fascicle length and fascicle volume. Results: The intervention group, showed significant changes in eccentric strength (+15%). The supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles showed significant increases in fascicle length (+13% and +8%), and in fractional anisotropy (+9% and +6%), which were significantly different from the control group. Conclusion: Eccentric isokinetic training has a significant effect on the function and macroscopic structure of the shoulder external rotators in male junior handball players. While strength parameters and muscle structure improved, range of motion did not change. This research helps understanding the physiology of muscle and the role of eccentric training on shoulder function and muscle structure. Furthermore, DTI was found to be a promising tool for advanced tissue characterization, and the in vivo derived data can also serve as model input variables and as a possibility to extend existing ex-vivo muscle models. Future research is needed for functional and structural changes following convenient eccentric field exercises.

Purpose: The aims of this study are (1) to compare rates of septic arthritis after primary and revision ACLR with QT, BTB, HT, and allograft and (2) to evaluate the association between an infection after ACLR and potential risk factors in a large single-system analysis. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: All ACLR cases performed by 10 high-volume sports medicine fellowship–trained ACL surgeons between January 2000 and January 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. Minimum follow-up was 90 days after ACLR, and all multiligament reconstructions were excluded. Demographic information, surgical variables, infection characteristics, and rate of ACL graft retention were collected for all included patients. Independent samples t test, chi-square test, or Fisher exact tests with adjusted Benjamini-Hochberg post hoc procedure were used for group comparisons. Results: In total, 6652 patients were included in this study. The most commonly used graft was allograft (n = 2491; 37.4%), followed by HT (n = 1743; 26.2%), BTB (n = 1478; 22.2%), and QT (n = 940; 14.1%). The overall postoperative rate of septic arthritis was 0.34% (n = 23). Septic arthritis rates based on graft type were 0.74% (n = 13) for HT, 0.24% (n = 6) for allograft, 0.20% (n = 3) for BTB, and 0.10% (n = 1) for QT. While a statistically significant difference with regard to graft type (P =.01) was observed, no significant relationships were found between postoperative septic arthritis and age, sex, revision ACLR, ACLR surgical technique, and accompanying intra-articular procedures for all septic arthritis patients (P >.05). The average time from the onset of the symptoms of infection to surgical irrigation and debridement (I&D) was 2 days (minimum, 0; maximum, 6). ACL grafts were retained during I&D procedures in all patients with postoperative septic arthritis. Conclusion: The postoperative rate of septic arthritis was 0.1% after use of the QT autograft.

Methods: We included individuals with knee and/or hip OA from the Good Life With OsteoArthritis in Denmark (GLA:D) program. GLA:D consists of 2 patient education sessions and 12 supervised exercise therapy sessions. Before GLA:D, participants self-reported any comorbidities and were categorized into 8 comorbidity groups. Twenty-one potential prognostic factors (demographic information, clinical data, and performance-based physical function) gathered from participants and clinicians before the program were included. Outcomes were physical function using the 40-meter Fast-Paced Walk Test (FPWT), health-related quality of life using the 5-level EuroQol 5-domain (EQ-5D-5L) index score, and pain intensity using a visual analog scale (VAS; range 0–100) assessed before and immediately after the GLA:D program. Within each comorbidity group, associations of prognostic factors with outcomes were estimated using multivariable linear regression. Results: Data from 35,496 (40-meter FPWT) and 37,576 (EQ-5D-5L and VAS) participants were included in the analyses. Clinically relevant associations were demonstrated between age, self-efficacy, self-rated health, and pain intensity and change in 40-meter FPWT, EQ-5D-5L, or VAS scores across comorbidity groups. Furthermore, anxiety, education, physical function, and smoking were associated with outcomes among subgroups having depression or diabetes mellitus in addition to OA. Conclusion: Age, self-efficacy, self-rated health, and pain intensity may be prognostic of change in health outcomes following an 8-week exercise therapy and patient education program for individuals with OA, irrespective of comorbidities. © 2021 The Authors.

Taking part in an ultramarathon is associated with great physiological and psychological stress, which can affect one’s mood, level of hormones, and peptides. The current study aimed to identify relationships between peptides, hormones, and mood states in participants during this ultramarathon. Methods: The study cohort consisted of 36 participants (19 men, 17 women, 38.64 ± 9.12 years) split into a finisher (n = 10), non-finisher (n = 19), and control group (n = 7). Data were collected at four time points: baseline (PRE), during (D1 after 277 km, D2 after 383 km), and after the race (POST). Questionnaires were used to assess ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), total quality of recovery (TQR), and profile of mood states (POMS-SF). Serum NPY, leptin, adiponectin, and cortisol were measured. Results: Among non-finishers, scores for confusion, anger, depression, and tension-anxiety (PRE vs. D2, p < 0.05) increased, while vigor decreased (PRE vs. D1, p < 0.05). In contrast, finishers’ tension-anxiety scores decreased (PRE vs. D1, p < 0.05). Fatigue increased in finishers (PRE vs. POST, p < 0.05) and non-finishers (PRE vs. D1, p < 0.05). In non-finishers, depressive mood correlated positively with leptin, anger, and confusion at several time points (p < 0.001). In finishers, NPY correlated with TQR at PRE (p < 0.05), while leptin correlated negatively with TQR at POST (p < 0.05). Tension-anxiety correlated highly with perceived exertion in non-finishers (p < 0.001) and with cortisol in finishers (p < 0.05) and non-finishers (p < 0.001). In finishers, confusion correlated negatively with NPY (p < 0.01). Conclusion: The study reveals an essential interplay between hormones and mood states affecting performance: Leptin was associated with anger and a depressive mood state in non-finishers and worse recovery in finishers. In contrast, NPY appeared linked to a lower confusion score and heightened recovery in finishers. A simultaneous increase in depressed mood, anger, tension-anxiety, and confusion might harm performance and lead to race failure.

We aimed to investigate the effects of regular swimming exercise and melatonin applied in the 6-Hydroxydopamine-induced Parkinson’s disease rats by analysing dendritic spine of striatal neurons. Twenty-four male Wistar albino rats were used. 6-Hydroxydopamine unilaterally injected four (control, exercise, melatonin and exercise + melatonin) groups were included in the study. Tyrosine hydroxylase expression was detected by immunohistochemistry. Neurons and structures were identified from three-dimensional images by Neurolucida software. There was not any apparent difference for tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and fibres in the striatum between the lesion sides of hemiparkinsonian groups. The treatment groups blocked the apomorphine-induced increase in rotations compared to the control group. In stepping test, the treatment groups prevented the loss of stepping in the contralateral side of hemiparkinsonian groups. The melatonin mostly had a positive effect on motor activity tests. In morphological analyses, the 6-Hydroxydopamine-induced lesion led to the reduction of the total dendritic length and number of branches. In the treatment groups, the reduction of the dendritic parameters was not observed. 6-Hydroxydopamine lesion led to a decrease in the total spine density, spine densities of thin and mushroom types. The exercise and melatonin treatments prevented the loss of spine density. The exercise treatment prevented the loss of spine density of mushroom type spines. The melatonin treatment blocked the loss of spine density of stubby type. In conclusion, these results provide evidence for effective additional protective therapeutic strategies for Parkinson’s disease. In conclusion, results from the current study provide evidence for swimming exercise and melatonin as a promising candidate for effective additional protective strategies for PD. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Japanese Association of Anatomists.",Dendritic spine; Melatonin; Neurolucida; Physical exercise; Striatum,"Animals; Male; Melatonin; Neurons; Oxidopamine; Parkinson Disease; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Substantia Nigra; Swimming; Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase; apomorphine; ketamine; melatonin; oxidopamine; peroxidase; tyrosine 3 monooxygenase; xylazine; melatonin; oxidopamine; tyrosine 3 monooxygenase; adult; akinesia; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apomorphine test; Article; brain nerve cell; cell density; cerebellar Golgi cell; controlled study; corpus striatum; dendritic spine; exercise; immunohistochemistry; immunoreactivity; male; medial forebrain bundle; nerve fiber; nonhuman; Parkinson disease; protein expression; rat; stereotactic procedure; substantia nigra pars compacta; swimming; therapy effect; three-dimensional imaging; animal; metabolism; nerve cell; Parkinson disease; substantia nigra; swimming; Wistar rat","""Cognitive Decline Prevention and Improvement through Exercise and Therapeutic Interventions""",Exercise Interventions and Cognitive Function in Older Adults,Exercise and Cognitive Function in Aging Adults

Twenty-six subjects were assigned to PLACEBO and CONTROL groups. Participants performed three sessions: Session 1-Cooper Test, Session 2-Baseline session and Session 3-Experimental session. During Session 2, participants performed a sprint-interval-training (SIT)-until-exhaustion preceded by a general warm-up, while in Session3 the SIT was preceded by a conditioning treatment (FIFA11+ warm-up), known to be effective in preventing injuries but not improving performance. Moreover, in Session3, only the PLACEBO group received verbal suggestions (before the warm-up) to influence participants' expectations about FIFA11+ effectiveness in improving performance, and deceptive feedback (during each SIT recovery bout) to increase the conditioning effect. To evaluate performance improvements, Running Time was chosen as a main outcome while to ensure participants reached exhaustion, physiological and metabolic responses were monitored. Total running distance (TRD) was also measured. Results showed that, Running Time and TRD significantly increased in the PLACEBO group whilst no differences in the CONTROL group were observed thus, suggesting the effectiveness of the within-session-placebo procedure in improving running performance. These findings shed a new light on the interaction between cognitive domain and performance, thus encouraging coaches to adopt this innovative method during the training protocol to enhance athletes’ performance. Moreover, this placebo procedure, not requiring additional time, tools or resources, could represent a more ecological approach that can be easily adopted in the field. © 2024 The Authors",Cognition; Endurance performance; Training,,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

This study explored the opinions about barriers to participating in sport among non-active older people from the perspective of 463 senior athletes (M = 61.4, SD = 5.5 years) engaged in competitive sports. Participants completed a questionnaire including an incomplete sentence regarding the reason why many older people do not play sports. We analysed their answers using content analysis and performed bivariate analyses to determine possible associations with the sociodemographic and participatory characteristics of the sample. The results highlighted a range of perceived barriers which mostly related to past and present opportunities, and contained significant variations according to age, country of residence, and years participating in sports. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the way in which senior athletes perceive the barriers for the initiation of non-active older people in sports participation which could inform potential measures to promote greater participation in sport as a meaningful leisure activity among this age group. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",barriers; beliefs; competitive sport; Older athletes; serious leisure; sport participation,,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Participation and Barriers in Sports and Physical Activities for Individuals with Disabilities

The study aimed to evaluate outpatient orthopedic teleconsultations' timing, length, and organizational issues in the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic based on consecutive orthopedic teleconsultations during the period of the first lockdown. Methods: Orthopedic telemedical consultations (OTCs) were provided from March 23, 2020, to June 1, 2020, and analyzed retrospectively based on mobile smartphone billing and electronic health record. Teleconsultations were based on the legal regulations of telemedicine services in Poland. Results: One thousand seventy-one patients (514 women and 557 men) with a mean age of 41.7 were teleconsulted. The length of the OTC averagely lasted 13.36 min (standard deviation 8.63). Consulted patients suffered from orthopedic disorders 65.3%, musculoskeletal injuries 26.3%, and other diseases 8.4%. Most OTCs were delayed (74.22%) concerning the planned schedule, with a median delay time of 12 min. Only 7.3% of teleconsultations were held precisely on time. Conclusions: Televisit length may not be dependent on gender, older age, or more diagnoses. The services like e-prescriptions, e-Referrals, e-Orders for orthotics, and e-Sick-leaves influence OTC length. Any extension of the patient's OTC may create a ""snowball effect""of further delay for each subsequent OTC. Orthopedic teleconsultation requires new understanding and skills by both the patient and specialist physicians. Future research directions should concern the practical aspects of orthopedic teleconsultations, like legal, organizational, and technological issues and their implementation.

Gender- and sport-specific normative anthropometric and physical values in talent-identified high school athletes. J Strength Cond Res 37(3): 606-615, 2023 - Youth sport is associated with the identification and promotion of athletes within talent development pathways, with anthropometric and physical performance measures being key assessment and monitoring tools. To adequately evaluate performance within a population, normative reference data are needed; however, currently, there is limited normative values of talent-identified youth athletes. The aim of the current study is to present normative values of talent-identified youth sport academy athletes in relation to gender, age, and sport. Over a 5-year period, a total of 794 talent-identified youth athletes who attended a specialized school sports academy were assessed using anthropometric (i.e., heigh,; body mass) and physical performance (i.e., vertical jump, 20-m sprint, Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test 1) measures. In total, 451 male and 343 female athletes (grade 7: 12-13 years; grade 8: 13-14 years; grade 9: 14-15 years; grade 10: 15-16 years) were tested annually. The result demonstrates that for each gender, as age increases, there is a general increase in anthropometric measures (i.e., height and body mass). Furthermore, with increasing age, athletes generally have a higher vertical jump, faster sprint performance, and improved physical endurance. The results highlight sport-specific differences for each measure. Overall, the results of the study provides age-, gender-, and sport-specific normative data of talent-identified youth athletes. These findings provide representative performance profiles of talent-identified high school athletes, with the values potentially being used by coaching staff (i.e., head coaches, strength and conditioning coaches, rehabilitation staff) for comparison purposes.  © Copyright 2022 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",performance data; power; speed; youth athlete,Adolescent; Anthropometry; Athletes; Athletic Performance; Female; Humans; Male; Physical Endurance; Youth Sports; adult; age; anthropometry; article; athlete; endurance; female; gender; high school; human; male; physical performance; rehabilitation; velocity; youth sport; adolescent; athlete; athletic performance; procedures,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Remote NPC has been reported after sport-related concussion (SRC), although the incidence among a university-aged population is not well defined. The purpose of the study was to examine the incidence of remote NPC after SRC in a cohort of Canadian interuniversity athletes.Design:Cross-sequential.Setting:University.Participants:One hundred thirty-two university athletes [SRC, n = 68; musculoskeletal (MSK) injury, n = 64] were tested before the beginning of their competitive season and again after their injury.Independent Variables:Healthy athletes measured preseason were compared with athletes after SRC or MSK injury using both longitudinal and cross-sectional designs.Main Outcome Measures:Remote NPC (pass/fail), measured at 6 cm or greater, repeated 3 times.Results:After SRC, 22% of athletes failed their test postinjury (95% CI, 14%-33%). Comparatively, in the MSK group, 3% of athletes failed their test postinjury (95% CI, 1%-7%). A direct comparison of both injury groups yielded a mean 19% higher prevalence of failed NPC tests after SRC versus MSK injury (95% CI, 10%-30%). There seems to be no relationship between reported symptom burden and NPC performance after SRC.Conclusion:Remote NPC occurs in approximately 1 of 5 athletes after SRC and is rarely observed after MSK injury. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Methods: Shear wave elastography measurements were conducted on a control group (CNT, n=14; age=59.9±10.6 years; BMI=24.5±2.5 kg/m2) and a stroke survivor group (SSG, n=14; age=63.2±9.6 years; BMI=23.2±2.8 kg/m2). Shear modulus within the GM and GL was obtained during passive ankle mobilization at various angles of dorsiflexion (P0 =0°; P1=10°; P2=20°; P3=-20° and P4=-30°) and during different levels (30%, 50%, 70%, 100%) of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). Muscle activations of GM, GL, soleus and tibialis anterior were also evaluated. Results: The results revealed a significant increase in passive stiffness within the paretic plantar flexor muscles under high tension during passive mobilization (p<0.05). Yet, during submaximal and maximal MVC, the paretic plantar flexors exhibited decreased active stiffness levels (p<0.05). A notable discrepancy was found between the stiffness of the GM and GL, with the GM demonstrating greater stiffness from 0° of dorsiflexion in the SSG (p<0.05), and from 10° of dorsiflexion in the CNT (p<0.05). No significant difference in stiffness was observed between the GM and GL muscles during active condition. Conclusion: Stroke affects the mechanical properties differently depending on the state of muscle activation. Notably, the distribution of stiffness among synergistic plantar flexor muscles varied in passive condition, while remaining consistent in active condition. © 2024 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology",Ankle joint; Paresis; Shear wave elastography; Skeletal muscle; Stiffness,"Aged; Ankle; Ankle Joint; Elasticity Imaging Techniques; Humans; Middle Aged; Muscle, Skeletal; Stroke; Chemical activation; Medical imaging; Muscle; Shear flow; Shear waves; Active force generation; Ankle joints; Dorsiflexions; Gastrocnemius; Maximal voluntary contractions; Mobilisation; Muscle activation; Paresis; Shear wave elastography; Skeletal muscle; adult; ankle dorsiflexion angle; Article; body mass; cerebrovascular accident; clinical article; controlled study; female; gastrocnemius lateralis muscle; gastrocnemius medialis muscle; gastrocnemius muscle; human; male; middle aged; muscle contraction; muscle rigidity; muscle strength; muscle tone; paresis; quantitative analysis; shear stress; shear wave elastography; soleus muscle; stroke survivor; tibialis anterior muscle; aged; ankle; diagnostic imaging; elastography; physiology; procedures; skeletal muscle; Stiffness","""Lower Extremity Health and Biomechanics: Studies on Pain, Function, and Treatment Methods""",Lower Limb Biomechanics and Pain Management in Chronic Conditions,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Recent studies increasingly point to links between muscle mass, particularly low muscle mass, and risk of cognitive decline. However, complex relationships exist between muscle mass, muscle function, physical activity, and overall health. Methods: Data from 1,424 adults 60+ years old in the 1999-2000 and 2001-2002 editions of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were used to investigate the relationship between low muscle mass and cognitive function after accounting for strength, physical activity, and nutritional and metabolic risk factors for cognitive decline. Results: Muscle strength and physical activity independently predicted performance in the digit symbol substitution test, with muscle mass and muscle strength explaining 0.5% and 5% of the variance in cognitive function, respectively. In graphical network analyses, the association between low muscle mass and cognitive function appeared to be primarily mediated by neuromuscular function. Physical activity was associated with strength but, surprisingly, not muscle mass, which was instead more closely related to total mass. Conclusions: Low muscle mass is a relatively poor predictor of cognitive function after accounting for physical activity and strength in older individuals from a representative population dataset in the US. Future studies should account for the way in which muscle mass is accrued, which is likely to confound any association between muscle mass and health outcomes. © 2023 The Authors.

Considering the effect of socio-economic status (SES) in relation to the MP of adolescents with DCD, it is necessary to examine this issue further. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Karate-Do interventions on the MP of adolescents with DCD from high/low SES. Methods: Participants included 16 adolescent girls (12 to 13 years old) with DCD, and their classification into high/low SES groups was done by using appropriate previously validated questionnaire. A short form of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, Second Edition (BOT-2), was used to assess fine motor precision, fine motor integration, manual dexterity, upper limb coordination, bilateral coordination, balance, strength, speed, agility, and overall MP level of the participants. Both high/low-SES groups completed a specifically prescribed Karate-Do intervention program for 8 consecutive weeks (3 sessions per week with each session lasting for 75 min). Results: Results from this 8-week intervention showed that the pattern of change in manual dexterity, bilateral coordination, strength and the total MP score improved over time in both groups with varied socioeconomic backgrounds. Specifically, the high-SES group performed significantly better than their low-SES counterparts during the 8-week Karate-Do intervention (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Following participants’ completion of the Karate-Do intervention, the existence of significant changes in the MP of adolescents’ with DCD at high/low SES confirmed our hypothesis. Compared to the low-SES group, adolescents with high SES displayed superior MP following the intervention. It seems that karate (kata) training serves as a good alternative for rehabilitation MP programs, however, an important issue concerning social infrastructure is to create a suitable exercise environment for adolescents at lower SES. Until the SES achievement gap in female adolescent MP is stable, future work is warranted to discover more practical and meaningful interventions. © 2022, The Author(s).",Girls; Martial arts; Motor skills; Movement impairment; Social class,adolescent; agility; Article; Bruininks-Oseretsky test of motor proficiency; child; clinical article; demographics; developmental coordination disorder; dexterity test; DSM-5; female; high school; human; Iran; karate; motor coordination; motor development; motor performance; Movement Assessment Battery for Children; neighborhood; physical activity; questionnaire; socioeconomic background; strength; velocity,"""Physical Activity Interventions and Motor Competence in Children with Disabilities""",Motor Skills Development and Intervention in Children with Disabilities,Physical Fitness in Children and Adolescents

We hypothesized that athletes reporting these 2 triad symptoms would have higher rates of time loss injury and injuries requiring surgery.Design:Retrospective case-control.Setting:Online survey.Patients:Four hundred seventy former collegiate gymnasts.Interventions:Athletes completed online survey distributed through social media.Main Outcome Measures:Participants were grouped based on self-reported menstrual irregularity and disordered eating during college. We compared time loss injuries, injuries resulting in surgery, and injury locations between the groups using χ2analyses.Results:Seventy percent (n = 328) of participants in this study reported a time loss college injury without surgery, and 42% (n = 199) reported an injury during college that required surgical treatment. A significantly greater proportion of gymnasts with only disordered eating reported a time loss gymnastics injury (without surgery) compared with those who reported only menstrual irregularity during college (79% vs 64%; P =0.03).

Although many flexible and adhesive hydrogel dressings for the repair of wounds at moving parts have been developed, in order to improve their flexibility and adhesion, most hydrogel dressings use synthetic polymers and natural polymers to form composite hydrogels, which greatly reduces their biocompatibility and bioactivity compared with a single natural polymer hydrogel. They can only passively provide a barrier to the wound and the process of wound repair is slow, which seriously hinders their further application. Inspired by commercial adhesive bandages, we have successfully constructed a flexible adhesive hydrogel dressing of embedded structure with pro-angiogenesis activity. The hydrogel was prepared by the adhesive and non-adhesive parts by topological adhesion and molecular entanglement. Due to the high-density hydrogen bonding, hydrogels possessed good adhesion and flexibility, which allowed them to repair wounds of moving parts successfully. In addition, the non-adhesive part loaded with exosomes was directly in contact with the wound, minimizing the stimulation of the wound tissue by cytotoxic materials, and continuously releasing active substances to promote vascular regeneration. This biocompatible flexible and adhesive hydrogel dressing with pro-angiogenesis activity shows strong potential in wound tissue remodeling, providing a new strategy for the treatment of moving parts or sensitive wound parts. © 2023 The Authors",Embedded structure; Hydrogel dressing; Hydrogen bonding; Pro-angiogenesis activity; Wound healing,Adhesion; Biocompatibility; Hydrogels; Hydrogen; Hydrogen bonds; Natural polymers; Repair; Synthetic polymers; Tissue; Tissue regeneration; Adhesive hydrogels; Angiogenesis; Embedded structures; Human bodies; Hydrogels dressings; Moving parts; Pro-angiogenesis activity; Wound healing; Wound repair; Wound tissue; Adhesives,Advancements in Therapies and Technologies for Osteoarthritis and Joint Disorders,Therapeutic Interventions and Their Efficacy in Osteoarthritis Treatment,Advances in Tissue Regeneration and Healing in Musculoskeletal Disorders

Twenty-two healthy participants (12 females, 23.5 ± 3.1 years) were recruited. LPHC stability was measured by number of errors committed during a seated trunk control test (STCT). Surface electromyography recorded muscle activity of rectus abdominis (RA), external oblique, internal oblique (IO), erector spinae, and gluteus medius during the STCT and single-leg squat, and was normalized to peak activity during the task. Two-dimensional motion analysis quantified frontal and sagittal plane kinematics of the trunk, hip, and knee. Following exhaustive exercise, STCT performance worsened (number of errors: pre: 5.5 (interquartile range (IQR) = 1.4–9.0), post: 8.0 (IQR = 3.6–11.3), p = 0.026.), RA activity increased during the single-leg squat (pre: 42.1 (IQR = 33.6–48.5)%, post: 61.1 (IQR = 39.4–156.7 %, p =.004), and participants displayed less hip and knee flexion (hip: pre: 72.4 ± 22.1°; post: 66.2 ± 22.5°, p =.049; knee: pre: 72.4 ± 15.4°; post: 67.4 ± 18.2°, p =.005).

Here, we tested the hypothesis that the exercise-induced increase in aerobic fitness was maintained at 6-month (6M) follow-up. Design: Six-month follow-up. Setting: University/hospital. Participants: Seventeen wheelchair-dependent participants with SCI. Interventions: 12-week of exercise training (UBROW) or control (CON). Outcome Measures: Aerobic fitness (POpeak and V̇O2peak), body composition, blood pressure, and blood biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk were assessed at 6M follow-up and compared to baseline (BL) and immediately post-intervention (12-week). Minutes of mild, moderate, and heavy intensity leisure time physical activity (LTPA) were assessed by self-report. Results: Fourteen participants returned at 6M follow-up (CON, n = 6; UBROW, n = 8). In UBROW, POpeak (median (Q1-Q3)) increased from BL (70 W (37–84)) to 12-week (77 W (58–109), P = 0.01) and 6M follow-up (81 W (51–96), P = 0.01), with no difference between 12-week and 6M follow-up (P = 0.21). Similarly, V̇O2peak increased from BL (15.4 ml/kg/min (10.5–19.4)) to 12-week (16.6 ml/kg/min (12.8–21.3), P = 0.01) with no difference between 12-week and 6M follow-up (16.3 ml/kg/min (12.9–19.7), P = 0.74). No differences were found in CON for either POpeak (P = 0.22) or V̇O2peak (P = 0.27). There were no changes over time in traditional cardiometabolic risk factors or for minutes of different LTPA intensities. Conclusion: We demonstrate that improvements in aerobic fitness are maintained for at least six months after completion of a 12-week exercise intervention, supporting the use of periodic exercise interventions to boost aerobic fitness level in individuals with SCI.

While applying LV during isometric voluntary contraction is thought to optimize the effects of LV, this has never been addressed considering the acute changes in central nervous system excitability. Materials and Methods: In the present study, nineteen healthy participants were engaged in four randomized sessions. LV was applied for 30 min to the relaxed flexor carpi radialis muscle (VIBRELAXED) or during wrist flexions (i.e. intermittent contractions at 10% of the maximal voluntary contraction: 15 s ON and 15 s OFF; VIBCONTRACT). A control condition and a condition where participants only performed repeated low-contractions at 10% maximal force (CONTRACT) were also performed. For each condition, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation and cervicomedullary evoked potentials (CMEPs) elicited by corticospinal tract electrical stimulation were measured before (PRE) and immediately after prolonged LV (POST) to investigate motoneuronal and corticospinal excitability, respectively. We further calculated the MEP/CMEP ratio as a proxy of cortical excitability. Results: No changes were observed in the control nor CONTRACT condition. At POST, CMEP decreased similarly in VIBRELAXED (−32% ± 42%, p <.001) and VIBCONTRACT (−41% ± 32%, p <.001). MEP/CMEP increased by 110% ± 140% (p =.01) for VIBRELAXED and by 120% ± 208% (p =.02) for VIBCONTRACT without differences between those conditions. Discussion: Our results suggest that LV to the flexor carpi radialis muscle, either relaxed or contracted, acutely decreases motoneuronal excitability and induces some priming of cortical excitability.

Limited SAB mortality and exposure risk explorations exist, so this cross-sectional study explores epidemiology and risk factors for SAB deaths (1 July, 2004–30 June,2020) in Australia: including decedent and incident profiles, causes of death, differences between fatalities during SAB and other coastal activities; and the impact of exposure on SAB mortality risk. Fatality data were sourced from the National Coronial Information System, incident and media reports. Tide-state data, population data and participation data were sourced from relevant authorities. Analyses included chi-square testing and simple logistic regression with odds ratios. There were 155 SAB deaths (80.6% surfing; 96.1% male; 36.8% aged 55+years; 0.04/ 100,000 residents; 0.63/100,000 surfers). Drowning was the most common cause of death (58.1%; n = 90), but higher in bodyboarding, with bodyboarders 4.62 times more likely to drown than surfers (95%CI: 1.66–12.82; p = 0.003). Almost half (44.5%; n = 69; χ22 = 9.802; p = 0.007) were with friends/family, and the largest proportion occurred during a rising tide (41.3%; n = 64; χ23 = 180.627; p<0.001) followed by a low tide (36.8%;n = 57). Australians surf 45.7 times each year, for 1.88 hours each visit equalling 86.1 ‘exposed’ hours. With exposure-time considered, exposure-adjusted surfer mortality rate (0.06/1 million hours) is lower than other in-water activities (0.11/1 million hours). Younger surfers (14–34 years) surfed more yet had the lowest mortality rate (114.5 hours/year; 0.02/1 million hours). Older surfers (55+ years) had a lower SAB mortality rate (0.052) than the all-cause crude mortality rate of their average population counterparts (1.36). Cardiac conditions were identified in 32.9% (n = 69) of SAB deaths. SAB are relatively safe, with lower exposure mortality rates than other activities. Prevention should target older surfers, inland residents, and identification of surfers with risk factors for cardiac events. © 2023 Lawes et al.

These CFs (i.e., the patient-practitioner relationship, patient’s and practitioner’s beliefs/characteristics, treatment characteristics, and environment) have not been widely evaluated by musculoskeletal practitioners. Understanding their views has the potential to improve treatment quality and effectiveness. Drawing on a panel of United Kingdom practitioners’ expertise, this study aimed to investigate their perceptions of CFs during the management of patients presenting with chronic low back pain (LBP). Methods: A modified two-round online Delphi-consensus survey was conducted to measure the extent of panel agreement regarding the perceived acceptability and influence of five main types of CFs during clinical management of patients with chronic LBP. Qualified musculoskeletal practitioners in the United Kingdom providing regular treatment for patients with chronic LBP were invited to take part. Results: The successive Delphi rounds included 39 and 23 panellists with an average of 19.9 and 21.3 years of clinical experience respectively. The panel demonstrated a high degree of consensus regarding approaches to enhance the patient-practitioner relationship (18/19 statements); leverage their own characteristics/beliefs (10/11 statements); modify the patient’s beliefs and consider patient’s characteristics (21/25 statements) to influence patient outcomes during chronic LBP rehabilitation. There was a lower degree of consensus regarding the influence and use of approaches related to the treatment characteristics (6/12 statements) and treatment environment (3/7 statements), and these CFs were viewed as the least important. The patient-practitioner relationship was rated as the most important CF, although the panel were not entirely confident in managing a range of patients’ cognitive and emotional needs. Conclusion: This Delphi study provides initial insights regarding a panel of musculoskeletal practitioners’ attitudes towards CFs during chronic LBP rehabilitation in the United Kingdom. All five CF domains were perceived as capable of influencing patient outcomes, with the patient-practitioner relationship being perceived as the most important CF during routine clinical practice. Musculoskeletal practitioners may require further training to enhance their proficiency and confidence in applying essential psychosocial skills to address the complex needs of patients with chronic LBP. © 2023, The Author(s).",Chiropractic; Chronic low back pain; Contextual factors; Delphi study; Health professional-patient relations; Musculoskeletal pain; Osteopathy; Physician-patient relations; Physiotherapy; Placebo effect,Delphi Technique; Humans; Low Back Pain; United Kingdom; adult; Article; clinical outcome; clinical practice; consensus; contextual factor; decision making; Delphi study; female; follow up; human; low back pain; male; musculoskeletal pain; perception; physiotherapy; placebo effect; professional-patient relationship; questionnaire; social competence; low back pain; United Kingdom,"""Pain Management and Musculoskeletal Health in Various Populations""",Chronic Pain Management and Treatment Studies,Management and Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

Results: Both workshops refined the app, namely: interface, background, acceptability/feasibility, results, teachers themselves, and effectiveness. Competitor analysis revealed recommendations for the wireframe, visuals, and proposed skills to be assessed. The need to include a demonstration for first-time users, video guidance, and links to more information for each skill was also raised.

Methods This cross-sectional study was performed by convenience sampling recreational and competitive roundnet athletes via a REDCap survey distributed through social media platforms. The custom survey evaluated athlete demographics, past sport participation, training workload and roundnet-related injuries throughout their whole playing career. Injury characteristics were reported for the full study cohort and compared between elite and non-elite athletes. Results 166 athletes participated in the study, with 33.7% playing at the elite level. 279 injuries were reported, with 86.1% (n=143) of athletes reporting at least one injury throughout their playing career. Injuries most frequently involved the shoulder (20%), ankle (18%), knee (14%) and elbow (14%). 47% of reported injuries occurred due to overuse, and 67% resulted in missed competition time averaging 2.0 months. There were 10 injuries (3.6%) that required surgery. No differences were found in regards to injury frequency (1.9±1.5 vs 1.6±1.1 injuries per athlete, p=0.159) or any injury characteristics between elite and non-elite athletes. Conclusion Roundnet athletes experienced a mean of 1.7±1.2 injuries while playing roundnet. Injuries most frequently involved the shoulder and ankle and often resulted in missed competition time. The level of competition does not significantly impact injury frequency or characteristics. Roundnet athletes may benefit from injury prevention programmes that include shoulder strengthening, maintaining shoulder range of motion and ankle stability.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.

What are the effects of compression garments on recovery from unaccustomed damaging exercise and subsequent protective adaptations? What is the main finding and its importance? Compression did not influence recovery, but was associated with blunted protective adaptations for isokinetic performance, which were completely absent at high velocities. Based on these findings, the use of compression garments for recovery would not be recommended following unaccustomed exercise, particularly if the maintenance of high-velocity performance following exercise-induced muscle damage is desirable. Abstract: Whilst compression garments (CG) may enhance recovery from exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD), many recovery strategies can attenuate adaptative responses. Therefore, the effects of CG on recovery from EIMD, and the rapid protective adaptations known as the repeated bout effect (RBE) were investigated. Thirty-four non-resistance-trained males (18–45 years) randomly received class II medical-grade CG or placebo for 72 h following eccentrically-focused lower-body exercise, in a double-blind, randomised controlled trial. Indices of EIMD were assessed at baseline, 0, 24, 48 and 72 h post-exercise, before exercise and testing were repeated after 14 days. Results were analysed using a three-way (time × condition × bout) linear mixed-effects model. Exercise impaired isometric and isokinetic strength, with soreness and thigh circumference elevated for 72 h (P < 0.001). Compression did not enhance recovery (P > 0.05), despite small to moderate effect sizes (ES, reported alongside 90% confidence intervals) for isokinetic strength (ES from 0.2 [−0.41, 0.82] to 0.65 [0.03, 1.28]). All variables recovered faster after the repeated bout (P < 0.005). However, RBE for peak isokinetic force was impaired in CG at 60° s−1 (group × bout interaction: χ2 = 4.24, P = 0.0395; ES = −0.56 [−1.18, 0.07]) and completely absent at 120° s−1 (χ2 = 16.2, P < 0.001, ES = −0.96 [−1.61, −0.32]) and 180° s−1 (χ2 = 10.4, P = 0.001, ES = −0.72 [−1.35, −0.09]). Compression blunted RBE at higher isokinetic velocities without improving recovery in non-resistance-trained males, potentially contraindicating their use following unaccustomed exercise in this population. © 2023 The Authors.

Females (Kerr et al.) and older adults over the age of 40 are more likely to experience PPCS (Ryan & Warden). Early education plays a vital role in concussion recovery and preventing the onset of PPCS (Rickards et al.). However, there are few studies that have focused explicitly on the education that patients with a concussion and PPCS are receiving. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore how the education given to midlife women with an mTBI affected their experiences with PPCS. Method: Five female participants (between the ages of 39 and 50) took part in one-on-one semi-structured online interviews to share their experiences with their concussion and PPCS and the education they received related to their injury. The interview transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis to identify main themes regarding their experiences. Results: The main themes identified related to (a) the variety and variability of education received, (b) the timing of the education in relation to their concussion diagnosis, and (c) the impact of the education and the process of getting information about PPCS. Implications: The results indicate a need for more research and proper education delivery on concussion and PPCS management among health care professionals to improve the experiences and recovery of patients with an mTBI. © 2024 The Author(s).

Also, motor imagery (MI) applied with actual movements could increase balance control. If both are combined, balance and cognitive function may increase more. Objective: To investigate the effect of exergame training with MI on balance, cognitive function and motor learning in healthy adults. Methods: Twelve subjects were divided into 2 groups, the exergame training (ET, n = 6) and the exergame with MI training (ET + MI, n = 6). Both groups practiced exergame for 20 minutes. Then, the ET+ MI group imagined exergame for 10 minutes. Subjects were trained 3 days per week for a period of 4 weeks. Balance and cognitive function were assessed before training, after 4 weeks of training, and in the follow-up period. Results: The results showed a significant increase in the single-leg stance test and trunk position sense found only in the ET + MI group, whereas % performance of static balance was significantly increased in both groups after 4 weeks of training and in the follow-up period (P < 0.05). Cognitive functions significantly improved in both groups in the follow-up period when compared with before training, except a corsi task in the ET group were greater in the follow-up period (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The ET with MI could facilitate better balance abilities.

Before such structural comparisons between injured and uninjured people can be made it is important to investigate a reliable measurement protocol of structures possibly related to CAI. The aim of this study was to investigate the inter-intra examiner reliability of ultrasonic characteristics of selected structures in healthy subjects. Methods: Eleven healthy participants were assessed by an experienced sonographer and inexperienced certificated examiner. Ultrasound images were collected of the ATFL length and ankle muscles of gastrocnemius medialis (GM), tibialis anterior (TA) and peroneals. Thickness was measured for the muscles, whilst cross-sectional area (CSA) was measured for the peroneals. Inexperienced examiner repeated the measurements a week later. Results: Inter-examiner reliability was excellent for all structures (ICC3,1 = 0.91–0.98). Intra-examiner reliability shows excellent agreement for all structures (ICC3,1 = 0.92–0.98) except GM (good agreement) (ICC3,1 = 0.82). LoA, relative to structure size, ranged from 1.38 to 6.88% for inter-reliability and from 0.07 to 5.79% for intra-reliability. Conclusion: This study shows a high level of inter-intra examiner reliability in measuring the structures possibly related to CAI.

Furthermore, autistic children often report having negative experiences in physical education. The physical educator is key to shaping these experiences; however, research examining these educators’ perspective towards teaching autistic children is limited. Aims: The purpose of this study was to explore physical educators’ experiences working with autistic children. Method: A sequential explanatory mixed methods approach was utilized by first administering a questionnaire to physical educators about their perceptions towards teaching autistic children, and second, conducting in-depth interviews with a subset of the sample. Results: Survey data revealed that participants perceived that a variety of autistic characteristics challenging their ability to effectively teach autistic children. These challenges were further elaborated on in qualitative data in the theme of ‘autism is a spectrum: an array of challenges’. Moreover, participants discussed strategies employed to effectively work with autistic children (theme 2: ‘best practices’), including the importance of relationship building (theme 3: ‘relationship building is vital’). Conclusions/Implications: Although physical educators are using various evidence-based practices and hold some views that the challenges autistic children face are partly attributed to society and the structures within it, a medical model viewpoint continues to be prominent.

Patients with DM show altered foot and ankle mechanics that have been attributed to tendon dysfunction as well as impaired recovery post-tendon injury. Despite the problem of DM-related tendon complications, treatment guidelines specific to this population of individuals are lacking. DM impairs tendon structure, function, and healing capacity in tendons throughout the body, but the Achilles tendon is of particular concern and most studied in the diabetic foot. At macroscopic levels, asymptomatic, diabetic Achilles tendons may show morphological abnormalities such as thickening, collagen disorganization, and/or calcific changes at the tendon enthesis. At smaller length scales, DM affects collagen sliding and discrete plasticity due to glycation of collagen. However, how these alterations translate to mechanical deficits observed at larger length scales is an area of continued investigation. In addition to dysfunction of the extracellular matrix, tendon cells such as tenocytes and tendon stem/progenitor cells show significant abnormalities in proliferation, apoptosis, and remodeling capacity in the presence of hyperglycemia and advanced glycation end-products, thus contributing to the disruption of tendon homeostasis and healing. Improving our understanding of the effects of DM on tendons—from molecular pathways to patients—will progress toward targeted therapies in this group at high risk of foot and ankle morbidity. © 2022 Diabetes Technology Society.",Achilles; diabetes mellitus; tendinopathy; tendinosis,Achilles Tendon; Collagen; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetic Foot; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Wound Healing; alkaline phosphatase; antiinflammatory agent; biglycan; collagen; collagen type 1; collagen type 3; decorin; fibromodulin; gelatinase A; Hermes antigen; interleukin 6; interstitial collagenase; lumican; matrix metalloproteinase; osteocalcin; osteonectin; osteopontin; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; pioglitazone; prasterone; proteoglycan; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 1; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 4; transcription factor RUNX2; versican; collagen; achilles tendinitis; achilles tendon; ankle; ankle dorsiflexion angle; apoptosis; Article; autophagy (cellular); cell migration; cell proliferation; cross linking; diabetes mellitus; diabetic foot; diabetic patient; elasticity; energy metabolism; enzymatic degradation; extracellular matrix; foot; gene expression; glycation; glycemic control; homeostasis; hospitalization; human; hyperglycemia; impaired glucose tolerance; inflammation; insulin treatment; metabolic syndrome X; morbidity; mouse; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; obesity; ossification; oxidative stress; peripheral neuropathy; phenotype; plantar pressure; plasticity; quality of life; rat; risk factor; senescence; stem cell; tendinitis; tendon; tendon injury; tendon reconstruction; tendon rupture; tenocyte; thermostability; ulcer; ultrasound; viscoelasticity; achilles tendon; diabetic foot; hyperglycemia; injury; metabolism; wound healing,"""Achilles Tendinopathy and Musculoskeletal Ultrasound Studies in Sport Medicine""",Achilles Tendon Health & Rehabilitation Research,Advances in Tissue Regeneration and Healing in Musculoskeletal Disorders

There are both conservative and surgical modes of treatment for OA. This study is done to compare the therapeutic efficacy of intra-articular ozone, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and 25% dextrose in the treatment of OA of the knee joint in early stages. Methods: A total of 120 patients with symptomatic Kellgren and Lawrence grade 2 and 3 of knee OA were studied. They were randomized into three groups and each group received three doses of intra-articular injections of either ozone or PRP or 25% dextrose at intervals of 2 weeks. Patients were advised physiotherapy and analgesics were avoided. Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index and Visual Analog Score for pain were used to evaluate the clinical outcomes for 6 months. Results: Ozone provided significant relief from pain and improved functionality but was short-lived. PRP and 25% dextrose results were slower initially but gave better results for a longer duration. Conclusion: Conservative treatment with intra-articular injections has promising results in the treatment of OA.

Synthesise our findings to identify emergent themes and knowledge gaps to inform future research and management directions. Methods: PubMed, Embase, Cinahl, SportDiscus, CENTRAL, and Web of Science were searched from inception to 31st December 2021. Articles were included if they referenced adult participants > 18 years of age and were written in English. Results: 214 articles were included in the final analysis, and results were categorised into six emergent themes: (1) Anatomy - Normal anatomical variation of the biceps from aberrant origins, third and fourth accessory heads, and an absence of the LHB tendon (LHBT) are not necessarily benign, with shoulder pain and instability a commonly reported theme. (2) Function - Bicep’s role in glenohumeral elevation and stability in healthy shoulders is minimal. In contrast, LHB has a more significant role in shoulder stability and humeral head depression in subjects with rotator cuff failure or an absent LHBT. (3) Pathology - There is an association between LHB tendinopathy, rotator cuff disease, LHBT instability and occult rotator cuff tears. Early recruitment and hyperactivity of the LHB in subjects with symptomatic rotator cuff tears and instability suggest a potential compensatory role. (4) Assessment - The limited diagnostic utility of special orthopaedic tests in assessing LHBT pathology was a consistent theme. The utility of magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound to identify full-thickness tendon tears and instability of the LHBT was moderate to high. However, the utility of clinical tests and imaging may be underestimated due to arthroscopy’s limitations in fully visualising the proximal LHBT. (5) Non-Surgical Management - Ultrasound-guided injections into the biceps sheath show greater accuracy and patient outcomes than blinded injections; however, the entry of injectate into the intraarticular glenohumeral joint may have unwanted complications. (6) Surgical management - For the surgical management of biceps pathology with or without rotator cuff pathology, both biceps tenodesis and tenotomy report similar improvements in pain without any significant adverse effect on strength or function. Tenodesis favoured higher overall constant scores and a lower incidence of Popeye deformity and cramping arm pain, with tenotomy trending to be more cost and time effective. For patients with a healthy LHBT, rotator cuff repair with adjunctive tenodesis or tenotomy fails to provide additional clinical improvements compared to rotator cuff repair in isolation. Conclusions: The scoping review highlights the variability of biceps anatomy, which is not necessarily benign and suggests a minimal role of the LHB in shoulder elevation and stability in healthy individuals. In contrast, individuals with rotator cuff tears experience proximal humeral migration and demonstrate hyperactivity of the LHB, suggesting a potential compensation role. The observed prevalence of LHBT pathology with rotator cuff tears is well established; however, the cause-and-effect relationship between LHBT pathology and rotator cuff disease is undetermined. The diagnostic utility of clinical tests and imaging to exclude LHBT pathology may be understated due to the limitations of arthroscopy to visualise the proximal LHBT fully. Rehabilitation programs for the LHB are understudied. Similar post-surgical clinical outcomes are observed for tenodesis and tenotomy for biceps and rotator cuff-related shoulder pain. Subjects undergoing biceps tenodesis are less likely to have cramping arm pain and a Popeye deformity than patients undergoing biceps tenotomy. The significance of routine surgical removal of the LHBT and sequelae on rotator cuff tear progression to failure and long-term shoulder function is unknown, and further research is required.

Methods: Patient-participants (17–85 years) were prospectively recruited within one week of a concussion. Participants received education over visits from Weeks 1 to 8 post-injury. Primary outcome measures were participant responses on a concussion knowledge questionnaire at Weeks 1 (n = 334) and 8 (n = 195), and feedback regarding education through interviews.

Patients without a diagnosis of mood disorders, such as anxiety and depression, before rotator cuff repair (RCR) can be considered an optimal candidate for surgery. The objective of this prospective observational study was to evaluate the relationship between anxiety and depressive symptoms, using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) as an assessment tool, and patient-reported outcome measures in RCT after repair surgery. This study included patients with RCT undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (RCR). Forty-three patients were included who had completed the HADS, Constant Murley Score (CMS), and Short Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36) questionnaires before surgery and in the postoperative follow-up, at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. The Friedman test showed that there were statistically significant changes in the different times point for HADS (p < 0.001), anxiety subscale of HADS, i.e., HADS-A (p < 0.001), depression subscale of HADS, i.e., HADS-D (p < 0.001), CMS (p < 0.001), and SF-36 (p < 0.001). The average scores of HADS, HADS-A, and HADS-D improved at each follow-up, showing improvement in discomfort. From the third month after surgery, there was an improvement in anxiety and depression disorders related to improved quality of life, functionality, and pain perception. The trend remained stable until the sixth month of follow up.

We further explored whether the effects of the intervention on glycemic parameters could be associated with the baseline lipidome. (2) Methods: Sixty-one participants were randomly allocated to control (Con), exercise (EX), vitamin D (VD), and EX + VD groups. Multiple glycemic and anthropometric parameters were evaluated before and after intervention. The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was the primary outcome. The plasma lipidome was analyzed before, after, and at an additional 12-week follow-up. Machine learning was applied to establish prediction models for responsiveness of glycemic control. (3) Results: Our interventions failed to improve the HOMA-IR index while fasting glucose was reduced in the EX + VD group (change%, −11.9%; effect size, 0.65; p < 0.05). Both EX and VD interventions altered the plasma lipidome, with EX + VD intervention considerably affecting levels of lyso-phosphatidylcholines and triglycerols containing long-chain unsaturated fatty acids. Such effects could last until 12 weeks after intervention. Notably, there was high inter-individual variability in glycemic parameters including HOMA-IR in response to the interventions, which could be predicted with great accuracy using an optimal panel of baseline lipid predictors alone or in combination with clinical indices, as assessed by an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of over 0.9. (4) Conclusions: Although substantial alterations were observed in the plasma lipidome related to glycemic control, our intervention failed to improve HOMA-IR scores, which may have been predominately due to the large inter-individual variability in responses. Basal plasma lipid levels could potentially predict an individual’s response to intervention, highlighting the necessity of personalized nutrition. © 2023 by the authors.",diabetes; exercise; insulin resistance; lipidomic profile; vitamin D,"Adult; Blood Glucose; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Dietary Supplements; Exercise Therapy; Humans; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Lipidomics; Lipids; Middle Aged; Vitamin D; Vitamins; lipid; lipidome; nature made; phosphatidylcholine; unsaturated fatty acid; vitamin D; insulin; lipid; vitamin; vitamin D; adult; anthropometric parameters; Article; clinical assessment; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; effect size; endurance training; female; follow up; glucose blood level; glycemic control; HOMA index; homeostasis model assessment; human; insulin resistance; lipid blood level; lipid fingerprinting; machine learning; major clinical study; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; outcome assessment; personalized nutrition; randomized controlled trial; receiver operating characteristic; vitamin blood level; vitamin supplementation; dietary supplement; kinesiotherapy; lipidomics; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus","""Effects of Exercise and Lifestyle Modification on Diabetes, Obesity, and Cardiovascular Health""",Effects of Exercise Programs on Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Health Outcomes,Effects of Exercise and Supplementation on Performance and Health

In most studies, the injection technique is not standardized, which makes it challenging to compare outcomes.Questions/purposes(1) Does injection with autologous blood, dextrose, or needle perforation only at the extensor carpi radialis brevis tendon origin produce better VAS pain scores during provocation testing at 5 months of follow-up? (2) Which percutaneous technique resulted in better secondary outcome measures: VAS during rest and activity, VAS during maximum grip, Oxford elbow score (OES), QuickDASH, Patient-related Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE), or EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D)?MethodsIn this multicenter, randomized controlled trial performed from November 2015 to January 2020, 166 patients with lateral epicondylitis were included and assigned to one of the three treatment groups: autologous blood, dextrose, or perforation only. Complete follow-up data were available for the primary outcome measures at the 5-month follow-up interval for 77% (127 of 166) of patients. Injections of the extensor carpi radialis brevis tendon were conducted in an accurate and standardized way. The three groups did not differ in terms of key variables such as age, gender, duration of symptoms, smoking habits, pain medication, and physiotherapy use. Data were collected at baseline and 8 weeks, 5 months, and 1 year after treatment and compared among the groups. The primary endpoint was the VAS pain score with provocation at 5 months. Our secondary study outcomes were VAS pain scores during rest, after activity, and after maximum grip strength; functional recovery; and quality of life. Therefore, we report the VAS pain score (0 to 100, with higher scores representing more-severe pain, minimum clinically important difference [MCID] 10), OES (0 to 48, with higher scores representing more satisfactory joint function, MCID 10), QuickDASH (0 to 100, with higher scores representing more severe disability, MCID 5.3), PRTEE (0 to 100, with higher scores representing more pain or more disability, MCID 20), EQ-5D/QALY (EQ-5D sumscore 0 to 1, with the maximum score of 1 representing the best health state, MCID 0.04), and EQ-5D VAS (0 to 100, with higher scores representing the best health status, MCID 8). For analysis, one-way analysis of variance and a linear mixed-model analysis were used. The analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Four patients from the perforation group opted to crossover to autologous blood after 5 months.ResultsNo injection therapy proved to be superior to any other in terms of VAS pain scores during the provocation test at 5 months of follow-up (VAS for perforation: 25 ± 31; autologous blood: 26 ± 27; dextrose: 29 ± 32; p = 0.35). For the secondary outcomes, only a clinically important difference was found for the QuickDASH score. Both the perforation-only group (-8 [98% CI -4 to -12]) and autologous blood (-7 points [98% CI -3 to -11]) had improved QuickDASH scores over time compared with the dextrose group (MCID 5.3; p < 0.01). For the other outcomes, no clinically important differences were found.ConclusionThere is no benefit to injectable autologous blood and dextrose over perforation alone to treat lateral epicondylitis, and they are therefore not indicated for this condition.Level of EvidenceLevel I, therapeutic study. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The reverse fragility index (RFI) is a statistical tool that provides an objective measure of the study’s neutrality by determining the number of events that need to change for a nonsignificant result to be significant. Purpose: The purpose was to utilize the RFI to appraise the strength of neutrality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the rerupture rates of acute Achilles tendon ruptures treated with open repair versus early functional rehabilitation. Study Design: Systematic review; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A systematic review was performed including all RCTs comparing the rerupture rates after operative repair and early functional rehabilitation for acute Achilles tendon ruptures. Studies were included that explicitly used early functional rehabilitation, defined as weightbearing and exercise-based interventions initiated within 2 weeks, as compared with open repair and reported a nonsignificant difference in rerupture rates. The RFI, with rerupture as the primary outcome, was calculated for each study (significance threshold, P <.05). The RFI quantifies a study’s strength of neutrality and is defined as the minimum number of event reversals necessary to change a nonsignificant result to statistically significant. Results: Nine RCTs were included, with 713 patients and 46 reruptures. The median (interquartile range) rerupture rate was 7.69% (6.38%-9.64%) overall, 4.00% (2.33%-7.14%) in the operative group, and 10.00% (5.26%-12.20%) in the nonoperative group. The median RFI was 3, indicating that an outcome reversal of 3 patients was necessary to change the results from nonsignificant to statistically significant. The median number of patients lost to follow-up was 6 (3-7). Of 9 studies, 7 (77.8%) had a loss to follow-up greater than or equal to its RFI. Conclusion: The statistical nonsignificance of studies reporting equivalent rerupture rates in the management of acute Achilles tendon ruptures with open repair versus nonoperative management with early functional rehabilitation can be reversed by changing the outcome status of only a few patients. © 2023 The Author(s).",Achilles tendon; ankle; foot; physical therapy/rehabilitation; statistics; tendon rupture,Achilles Tendon; Acute Disease; Humans; Physical Therapy Modalities; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Rupture; Tendon Injuries; Treatment Outcome; achilles tendon; acute disease; human; physiotherapy; randomized controlled trial (topic); rupture; surgery; tendon injury; treatment outcome,"""Achilles Tendinopathy and Musculoskeletal Ultrasound Studies in Sport Medicine""",Achilles Tendon Health & Rehabilitation Research,Tendon Rehabilitation and Treatment Methods

This study aimed to investigate the influencing factors of cognitive frailty in elderly patients with diabetes and develop a nomogram for its assessment. Methods: We collected the clinical data of diabetic patients aged 60 years or older and the patients were divided into training and validation cohorts at a ratio of 7:3. In the training cohort, logistic regression was used to screen out the influencing factors of cognitive frailty in elderly diabetic patients, and a risk prediction model and nomogram were constructed and verified in the validation cohort. The performance of the model was evaluated using various measures, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration curve, Hosmer-Lemeshow test and decision curve analysis. Results: A total of 315 elderly diabetic patients were included, of which 87 (27.6%) patients had cognitive frailty. Age, albumin levels, calf circumference, duration of diabetes, intellectual activity, and depressive state were identified as independent risk factors for cognitive frailty in older patients with diabetes (P < 0.05). The training cohort and validation cohort demonstrated area under curve (AUC) values of 0.866 and 0.821, respectively. Conclusion: Older patients with diabetes have a higher prevalence of cognitive frailty. The nomogram model exhibited satisfactory calibration and identification, providing a reliable tool for assessing the risk of cognitive frailty in individuals with diabetes. © 2023 Deng et al.

We sought to identify typical presenting symptoms and common findings on diagnostic workup, in addition to evaluating rates of return to play following various treatment interventions. Design: Retrospective chart review. Setting: Single institution. Participants: Medical records of Division 1 athletes containing the diagnosis of nTOS between the years 2000 and 2020 were identified. Athletes with arterial or venous thoracic outlet syndrome were excluded. Independent Variables: Demographics, sport, participation status, clinical presentation, physical examination findings, diagnostic workup, and treatments provided. Main Outcome Measures: Rate of return to play (RTP) to collegiate athletics. Results: Twenty-three female and 13 male athletes were diagnosed and treated for nTOS. Digit plethysmography showed diminished or obliterated waveforms with provocative maneuvers in 23 of 25 athletes. Forty-two percent were able to continue competing despite symptoms. Of the athletes who were initially unable to compete, 12% returned to full competition after physical therapy alone, 42% of those remaining were able to RTP after botulinum toxin injection, and an additional 42% of the remaining athletes RTP after thoracic outlet decompression surgery. Conclusions: Many athletes diagnosed with nTOS will be able to continue competing despite symptoms. Digit plethysmography is a sensitive diagnostic tool for nTOS to document anatomical compression at the thoracic inlet. Botulinum toxin injection had a significant positive effect on symptoms and a high rate of RTP (42%), allowing numerous athletes to avoid surgery and its prolonged recovery and associated risks. Clinical Relevance: This study demonstrates that botulinum toxin injection had a high rate of return to full competition in elite athletes without the risks and recovery needed for surgical intervention, suggesting that this may be a good intervention especially among elite athletes who only experience symptoms with sport-related activities.  © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Methods: A prospective case series study included 12 adult patients with a mean age of 25.2 ± 8.1 years who presented with GV deformity associated with lateral thrust. They were evaluated clinically using the “hospital for special surgery” (HSS) knee scoring system. Radiological evaluation was performed using long film from hip to knee to ankle (HKA) radiographs; the overall mechanical alignment was measured as the HKA angle, the upper tibial deformity was measured as the medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA), and the joint line convergence angle (JLCA) was measured. Surgical technique included using Ilizarov for MWOHTO below the level of the tibial tubercle, acute correction of the GV deformity, fibular osteotomy, and gradual distalization of the proximal fibula. Results: After a mean follow-up of 26.3 ± 6.4 months, all osteotomies were united. All patients achieved fibular osteotomy site bony union except two with a fibrous union. The HSS score showed improvement from a mean preoperative score of 88.7 ± 7.6 to a postoperative 97.3 ± 3.9 (P < 0.05). The overall mechanical lower limb alignment improved significantly from a mean preoperative HKA of 164.5 ± 3.2 to a postoperative 178.9 ± 1.6 (P < 0.05). The MPTA improved significantly from 74.6 ± 4.1 to 88.9 ± 2.3, as well as the JLCA from 12.17 ± 1.9 to 2.3 ± 1.7 (P < 0.05). Grade 1 pin tract infection was developed in four patients and was treated conservatively. In two patients, mild pain over the fibular osteotomy site was relieved over time. The lateral thrust reoccurred at the last follow-up evaluation in the two poliomyelitis patients.

Possibly, weight issues result from lowered resting energy expenditure (EE) and impaired muscle oxidative metabolism. Objectives: This study aims to assess EE, body composition, and muscle oxidative capacity in patients with DM1 compared to age-, sex- and BMI-matched controls. Methods: A prospective case control study was conducted including 15 DM1 patients and 15 matched controls. Participants underwent state-of-the-art methodologies including 24 h whole room calorimetry, doubly labeled water and accelerometer analysis under 15-days of free-living conditions, muscle biopsy, full body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), computed tomography (CT) upper leg, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Results: Fat ratio determined by full body MRI was significantly higher in DM1 patients (56 [49-62] %) compared to healthy controls (44 [37-52] % ; p = 0.027). Resting EE did not differ between groups (1948 [1742-2146] vs (2001 [1853-2425>] kcal/24 h, respectively; p = 0.466). In contrast, total EE was 23% lower in DM1 patients (2162 [1794-2494] vs 2814 [2424-3310] kcal/24 h; p = 0.027). Also, DM1 patients had 63% less steps (3090 [2263-5063] vs 8283 [6855-11485] steps/24 h; p = 0.003) and a significantly lower VO2 peak (22 [17-24] vs 33 [26-39] mL/min/kg; p = 0.003) compared to the healthy controls. Muscle biopsy citrate synthase activity did not differ between groups (15.4 [13.3-20.0] vs 20.1 [16.6-25.8] μM/g/min, respectively; p = 0.449). Conclusions: Resting EE does not differ between DM1 patients and healthy, matched controls when assessed under standardized circumstances. However, under free living conditions, total EE is substantially reduced in DM1 patients due to a lower physical activity level. The sedentary lifestyle of DM1 patients seems responsible for the undesirable changes in body composition and aerobic capacity. © 2023 - The authors.",body composition; energy expenditure; Myotonic dystrophy; physical activity,"Body Composition; Case-Control Studies; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Muscle, Skeletal; Myotonic Dystrophy; Oxidative Stress; citrate synthase; water; accelerometry; adult; aerobic capacity; aerobic metabolism; age; aged; Article; body composition; body fat; body mass; calorimetry; cardiopulmonary exercise test; case control study; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; cross-sectional study; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; energy expenditure; enzyme activity; female; human; human tissue; male; middle aged; muscle biopsy; myotonic dystrophy; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; obesity; peak oxygen uptake; prospective study; sex; skeletal muscle; body composition; energy metabolism; myotonic dystrophy; oxidative stress; pathology; skeletal muscle","""Effects of Different Factors on Muscle Performance and Metabolism""",Exercise and Muscle Performance in Different Individuals,Spinal Cord Injury and Exercise Rehabilitation

This study aimed to investigate physical activity using a triaxial activity monitor in community-dwelling older Japanese adults with and without lifestyle-related diseases. Methods: Data from a total of 732 community-dwelling older Japanese men and women were collected and analyzed in a cross-sectional study. The participants’ physical activity was assessed for seven consecutive days by a triaxial accelerometer. Physical activity was assessed by number of lifestyle-related diseases and six lifestyle-related diseases categories by gender. Physical activity was assessed separately for total, locomotive, and nonlocomotive physical activity. Results: Participants with multiple (two or more) diseases had significantly lower total light-intensity physical activity (LPA; 278.5 ± 8.4 min/day) and nonlocomotive LPA (226.4 ± 7.0 min/day) versus without diseases in men.

Design: Randomized clinical trial. Setting: Veteran Affairs Hospital, Palo Alto, CA. Participants: Sample included 72 community-dwelling volunteers (mean age 72.4 ± 9.5) diagnosed with aMCI. Intervention: Participants were randomized to either a combined aerobic and resistance exercise + cognitive training (CARE+CT) or stretching exercise + CT (SE+CT). Measurements: Primary outcomes included intervention specific assessments of word list and name-face recall. Secondary cognitive outcomes included standardized composite scores that reflect cognitive domains (e.g., learning and memory, executive function, processing speed, visuospatial ability, language). Secondary physiological outcomes included VO2 max and functional capacity (e.g., distance walked 6-minute walk test). APOE and BDNF were determined from whole blood samples. Results: Controlling for age and employment status, linear mixed effects models revealed that all participants experienced significant improvement in the delayed recall of word list, learning and memory and executive function. Only the CARE+CT condition had significant improvement in processing speed and functional capacity. APOE4 status impacted cognitive benefits of those in the SE+CT condition. Conclusions: Results provide preliminary support for combined exercise and cognitive training interventions for older adults with aMCI.

Evidence supporting any particular treatment approach for the management of post-COVID pain is lacking. Large variability in the patient response to any standard pain treatments is clinically observed, which has led to calls for a personalized, tailored approach to treating patients with chronic post-COVID pain (i.e. ‘precision pain medicine’). Applying the global concerted action towards precision medicine to post-COVID pain could help guide clinical decision-making and aid in more effective treatments. Methods The current position paper discusses factors to be considered by clinicians for managing post-COVID pain ranging from identification of the pain phenotype to genetic consideration. Results The ability of clinicians to phenotype post-COVID pain into nociceptive, neuropathic, nociplastic or mixed type is suggested as the first step to better planification of a treatment programme. Further, the consideration of other factors, such as gender, comorbidities, treatments received at the acute phase of infection for onset-associated COVID-19 symptoms, factors during hospitalization or the presence of emotional disturbances should be implemented into a treatment programme. Conclusions Accordingly, considering these factors, management of post-COVID pain should include multimodal pharmacological and non-pharmacological modalities targeting emotional/cognitive aspects (i.e. psychological and/or coping strategies), central sensitization-associated mechanisms (i.e. pain neuroscience education), exercise programmes as well as lifestyle interventions (e.g. nutritional support and sleep management).

We aimed to explore the influence of smartphone-based physical activity promotion on weight loss and cognitive functions in obese young adults. Methods: In our pilot randomised controlled trial, 24 obese adults were randomized to two conditions: (1) EXI group receiving a smartphone-application based personalized physical activity prescription; (2) CONT group continuing their routine work for eight weeks. Executive functions and cardiometabolic risk variables [body and fat mass, waist circumference (WC), blood pressure (BP)] and executive functions were measured before and after eight weeks. Results: Our study findings revealed a significant improvement in reaction times with overall (H = 7.71, p = 0.005), congruent stimuli (H = 4.43, p = 0.03) and incongruent stimuli (H = 5.35, p = 0.02) between groups. Though EXI participants reduced their fat mass by 5.07 kg more than CONT group users after eight weeks, the findings were statistically insignificant. Similarly, our study did not find significant differences in body mass, WC, BP or accuracy between EXI and CONT groups. There was a decreased user engagement (H = 5.80, p = 0.564) after the 3rd week of the study period. Conclusion: Short-term smartphone-based physical activity programs may offer favourable cognitive benefits to young adults; however, the weight loss benefits remain unconvincing.

In sports, there are stress factors that affect the athlete’s performance, especially in team sports that involve short, high-intensity exercise cycles followed by short recovery periods, such as American football. The lack of stress regulation mechanisms can be detrimental to the individual and collective performance of athletes. Biofeedback systems have shown promising clinical results in regulating stress for sports competitions. However, there is a lack of scientific evidence to support their efficacy, and technologies, such as virtual reality videogames, have not been extensively explored. In this article, we present the development and pilot testing of Virtual Autonomic Nervous System (VANS), a virtual reality videogame using biofeedback that supports stress management training in athletes. VANS uses an optical heart rate sensor and aims at keeping the heart rate below a given threshold to control features within the game. We evaluated the usability and user experience of VANS through a 1-week deployment study with 10 American footballers. Our results show that VANS outperformed a commercial videogame used for biofeedback training and considerably reduced stress in our participants. Therefore, VANS could provide stress management training for future matches and competitions. Finally, we reflect on aspects of our design and discuss future directions of our work. © The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The British Computer Society.

The anthropometric profiles of 357 elite soccer players [184 males (age 24.3 ± 4.3 y) and 173 females (age 25.2 ± 5.1 y)] participating in the first Italian league (Serie A) and 363 subjects from the general population [188 males (age 24.2 ± 4.8 y) and 175 females (age 25.0 ± 5.1 y)] were measured according to the guidelines of the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK). Reference percentiles for stature, body mass, circumferences, eight skinfolds (biceps, triceps, subscapular, suprailiac, supraspinal, abdominal, front thigh, and calf), breadths, and somatotype were calculated and stratified by player position and sex. No difference (p > 0.05) was found in age between the two groups. Soccer players showed lower values for the sum of the eight ISAK skinfolds than individuals from the general population of the same sex. This suggests lower adipose tissue, as indicated by a lower endomorphic component. The somatotype was endomorphic mesomorph and mesomorphic endomorph for the male and female individuals from the general population, respectively. The male soccer players were ectomorphic mesomorphs, while the females were balanced mesomorphs, defining a sport-specific morphology.

The factors underlying these different dietary choices are not yet clear. Individual differences in people’s reactions to environmental stress may help explain this phenomenon. This study proposed a Gene × Stress interaction model of dietary choice, suggesting that different dietary choices under stress may be related to DRD2 genes, which moderate the reward circuitry and have been associated with habitual use of alcohol, obesity, and eating behaviors. Method: 12,269 employees completed genotyping of their saliva samples and questionnaires on work stress, healthy dietary intentions, and healthy dietary behaviors. Nonlinear multiple regressionswere used to test the hypothesized interaction of DRD2 genes and work stress on healthy dietary intentions and healthy dietary behaviors. Results: Individuals with higher work stress reported lower healthy dietary intentions, whereas healthy dietary behaviors exhibited an inverted U shape. DRD2 genes significantly moderated this relationship, and the above relationship was only detected among C allele carriers, whereas for the AA genotype, work stress was not associated with healthy dietary intentions or behaviors. Conclusions: Healthy dietary intentions and healthy dietary behaviors showed different patterns of association with work stress.

The purpose of this study was to characterize the torque-velocity relationship in the quadriceps following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction compared to healthy limbs. Methods: 681 participants were included, 493 of which were patients at least four months following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (23.2 ± 10.08 yr, 6.6 ± 5.37 months post-surgery) and 188 were healthy participants (21.6 ± 3.77 yr). A subset of 175 post-surgical participants completed a repeated visit (8.1 ± 1.71 months post-surgery). Participants completed isokinetic knee extension at 90°/s and 180°/s. A one-way ANOVA was used to compare torque velocity relationships by limb type (surgical, contralateral, healthy). Paired samples t-tests were conducted to analyze the torque-velocity relationship across limbs and across time. Findings: There was a large effect for limb type on torque-velocity (F(2, 1173) = 146.08, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.20). Surgical limbs demonstrated significantly lower torque-velocity relationships compared to the contralateral limbs (ACLR: 0.26 Nm/kg, contralateral:0.55 Nm/kg, p < 0.001, d = 1.18). Healthy limbs had similar torque-velocity relationships bilaterally (dominant limb: 0.48 Nm/kg, non-dominant limb: 0.49 Nm/kg, p = 0.45). The torque velocity relationship for the involved limb significantly increased in magnitude over time (+0.11 Nm/kg, p < 0.001, d = −0.61) while the contralateral limb torque-velocity relationship remained stable over time (0.0 Nm/kg difference, p = 0.60). Interpretation: Following surgery, the knee extensors appear to have altered torque-velocity relationships compared to contralateral and healthy limbs.

Musculoskeletal disorders are the main cause of chronic pain, illness, reduced educational performance, productivity, and quality of life, and are responsible for increased absenteeism, which could compromise the future career of students. The purpose of this study was to identify the prevalence of postural changes and the occurrence of musculoskeletal disorders in different anatomical regions in the 12 months prior and 7 days prior to the application of the questionnaire and the number of affected anatomical regions. Methods: This is an observational, descriptive, cross-sectional study. It included 508 students selected by a stratified random sample. Our outcomes were the Portuguese version of the Standardized Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire, the Adam’s test, a scoliometer, and the visual analog pain scale associated with the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire. Results: In total, 79.3% of the students tested positive with the Adam’s test. The neck, shoulder, lumbar region, and knee stood out in all of the temporal references, the 12 months prior (44.3%; 35.2%, 50.2%, 34.1%) and the 7 days prior (16.5%, 16.9%; 28.9%, 17.5%), and even in the restriction of activity due to painful symptoms in the 12 months prior (4.3%, 5.3%, 10.6%, 8.5%). Conclusions: Out of 497 students, 403 were identified with postural changes.

Methods: Sixty patients with HFpEF were randomly divided into group A (n=20), receiving Shexiang Baoxin Pill combined with home-based exercise training based on conventional drugs for 12 weeks; group B (n=20), receiving conventional drugs combined with home-based exercise training for 12 weeks; and group C (n=20), receiving conventional drug treatment only. Peak oxygen uptake (peakVO2), anaerobic threshold (AT), 6-min walking test (6MWT), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and SF-36 questionnaire (SF-36) results before and after treatment were compared among groups. Results: After the 12-week intervention, patients in group C showed significant declines in peakVO2, AT, 6MWT, PSQI, and SF-36 compared with pre-treatment (P<0.01), while groups A and B both showed significant improvements in peakVO2, AT, 6MWT, PSQI, and SF-36 results compared with pre-treatment (P<0.01). Compared with group C, patients in groups A and B showed significant improvements in peakVO2, AT, 6MWT, PSQI, and SF-36 (P<0.01). In addition, patients in group A showed more significant improvements in physical function, role-physical, vitality, and mental health scores on the SF-36 questionnaire, and PSQI scores than those in group B (P<0.01). Conclusions: Exercise training improved exercise tolerance, sleep quality and quality of life (QoL) in patients with HFpEF. Notably, Shexiang Baoxin Pill played an active role in sleep quality and QoL of patients with HFpEF.

Forty-two recreationally active women; 21 naturally menstruating and 21 combined, monophasic, oral contraceptive pill users participated in the study. Data were collected using two approaches: (a) an online 54-part retrospective survey and (b) a daily questionnaire. “Total number of symptoms,” “symptom index score,” “average symptom severity,” and “symptom index × severity score” were calculated from the retrospective data set. Real-time symptom data (i.e., “symptom frequency per phase” and “phase symptom frequency × severity score”) were calculated across predefined cycle phases from the daily questionnaire. The retrospective survey showed that symptoms were commonly reported by recreationally active women, but there were no differences in symptomology between the groups (p >.113). The daily questionnaire showed both groups experienced a greater frequency and severity of symptoms while bleeding (p ≤.001), which was associated with perceived reductions in exercise performance (odds ratio = 1.04–1.07) and a perceived longer recovery time posttraining (odds ratio = 1.03– 1.04). The results from this study show that cycle-related symptoms were commonly reported by a group of recreationally active women, with no difference in symptomology between naturally menstruating women and combined, monophasic, oral contraceptive pill users. The magnitude of symptoms was greater while bleeding, which was associated with a perceived reduction in exercise performance and a longer recovery time posttraining. © 2024 University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG).",female athlete; hormonal contraception; menstrual cycle,,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

However, change in children’s behaviour has obesity as a possible consequence. “Join the Healthy Boat” promotes a healthy lifestyle to improve children’s health holistically. This work aimed to find out whether the programme affects children’s health and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Methods: 401 children (3.65±0.56 years; 54.1% boys) from 57 kindergartens were included. The intervention group (IG) carried out a yearlong programme on healthy eating and physical activity. The control group (CG) followed the normal kindergarten routine. Anthropometric data were collected objectively. Information on HRQoL, sick days and doctors’ visits were collected subjectively. Intervention effects were analysed using difference measures, Chi² tests and logistic regressions. Results: Over the study year, IG showed no significant intervention effects but a greater increase in HRQoL than CG (1.09±5.65 vs. 0.43±5.67, p=0.40) and a greater reduction in sick days (-1.25±5.30 vs-0.50±5.52, p=0.38) and doctors’ visits (-0.79±3.16 vs-0.39±2.95, p=0.75), neither are significant. Conclusions: “Join the Healthy Boat” did not achieve significant intervention effects on HRQoL, sick days and doctor visits. However, the programme showed promise in improving HRQoL, which could potentially be significant with a longer duration of study. © 2024, Dynamic Media Sales Verlag.

A quasi-experimental study of two Physical Education programmes in preschool education,2023,Journal of Human Sport and Exercise,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159009589&doi=10.14198%2fjhse.2023.182.20&partnerID=40&md5=75575d7560ae985ff3baf5183f4dd6b1,"Early childhood is a key stage for promoting Physical Education as a means for improving motor competence in children. With this in mind, is there a particular psychomotor stimulation method that can improve said competence? The aim of this study was to analyse and compare the effects on motor competence of two Physical Education and psychomotor stimulation programmes in 4-year-old children. The psychomotor profile of a sample of 49 preschool children (53.1% boys and 46.9% girls; Mage = 4.66, SD = 0.27) was examined using a quasi-experimental model and the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2 (MABC-2). The percentiles achieved in the tests that make up the battery were measured, which were grouped into three domains: manual dexterity, aiming and catching and balance, as well as the overall psychomotor profile. The control group (n = 25, 52% boys and 48% girls) followed an annual Physical Education programme consisting of a single 50-minute weekly session. The experimental group (n = 24, 54.2% boys and 45.8% girls) followed an early psychomotor stimulation programme based on the Doman method, with 5 weekly sessions lasting 25 minutes each. The results show no significant differences in the psychomotor profile between the control and experimental groups, both in the total percentile and in the percentile of manual dexterity, aiming and catching or balance. Significant differences were found in both groups between the pre-test and the post-test, with greater differences displayed in the control group. The findings suggest that a single session of Physical Education has a greater impact on the psychomotor profile than 5 weekly 25-minute sessions following the Doman method of early stimulation. Furthermore, these findings also point to the need to provide personalised Physical Education that enhances the psychomotor profile of each child. © Faculty of Education.

Exergames try to tackle this problem by combining exercising with motivational gameplay. Another approach in sports science is the use of auditory-motor synchronization, the entrainment of movements to the rhythm of music. There are already commercially successful games making use of the combination of both, such as the popular VR rhythm game BeatSaber. However, unlike traditional exercise settings often relying on periodic movements that can be easily entrained to a rhythmic pulse, exergames typically offer an additional cognitive challenge through their gameplay and might be based more on reaction or memorization. That poses the question as to what extent the effects of auditory-motor synchronization can be transferred to exergames, and if the synchronization of music and gameplay facilitates the playing experience. We conducted a user study (N = 54) to investigate the effects of different degrees of synchronization between music and gameplay using the VR rhythm game BeatSaber. Results show significant effects on performance, perceived workload, and player experience between the synchronized and non-synchronized conditions, but the results seem to be strongly mediated by the ability of the participants to consciously perceive the synchronization differences.  © 2022 Owner/Author.",auditory-motor synchronization; exergames; rhythm games,Interactive computer graphics; Auditory-motor synchronization; Condition; Exergames; Gameplay; Health concerns; Performance; Player experience; Rhythm game; Sport science; User study; Synchronization,"""Virtual Reality and Exergames in Rehabilitation and Exercise""",Virtual Reality Interventions in Motor Rehabilitation and Sports for Older Adults,Impact of Visual and Virtual Reality Interventions in Sports and Rehabilitation

Study design: Randomised cross-over trial. Participants: Twenty-seven participants (age = 26.0 years ±6.4) with no current or recent history of lower back or leg pain/surgery completed the study. Main outcome measures: Participants attended two sessions, receiving either grade 3 (‘treatment’) or grade 1 (‘sham’) unilateral spinal mobilisations. Outcome measures (modified-modified Schober's test [MMST], ninety-ninety test [NNT], and passive straight-leg raise [PSLR]) were assessed immediately before and after (post-1 and post-2) the intervention. An instrumented hand-held dynamometer was used to measure the change in NNT and PSLR joint angle (deg) and passive stiffness (Nm/deg) pre- and post-intervention. Results: The mean change in PSLR angle at the first (P1) and maximal (P2) point of discomfort following the treatment was 4.8° and 5.5°, and 5.6° and 5.7°, larger than the sham at post-1 and post-2, respectively. There was no effect of the treatment on the PSLR at P1 or P2 for the contralateral limb at either timepoint. There was no effect of the treatment on MMST distance, NNT angle or passive stiffness, or PSLR passive stiffness, for either limb. Conclusions: Immediate effects of unilateral posterior-anterior lumbar mobilisations in asymptomatic individuals are isolated to treatment side and limited to a small increase in PSLR range, with no change in lumbar motion or the NNT test. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Flexibility; Hamstrings; Mechanosensitivity; Mobilisations; Passive stiffness,"Adult; Cross-Over Studies; Humans; Leg; Lower Extremity; Lumbosacral Region; Pain; Range of Motion, Articular; adult; Article; asymptomatic disease; clinical article; controlled study; crossover procedure; female; human; joint angle; lateral malleolus; leg pain; low back pain; lower limb; lumbar mobilization; male; mobilization; randomized controlled trial; range of motion; trunk; leg; lower limb; lumbosacral region; pain",Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Evaluation and Improvement of Postural Balance and Muscle Strength

Methods: This was a prospective observational registry cohort study based on the Swedish National Knee Ligament Registry. Patients undergoing isolated ACL-R, isolated PCL-R, and combined ACL/PCL-R between 2005 and 2019 were eligible for inclusion. Demographic characteristics as well as injury- and surgery-related data were queried from the SNKLR. To evaluate functional outcomes, the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) was collected preoperatively and at 1- and 2-year follow-ups and compared between the treatment groups. Results: In total, 45,169 patients underwent isolated ACL-R, 192 patients isolated PCL-R, and 203 patients combined ACL/PCL-R. Preoperatively, and at the 1- and 2-year follow-ups, KOOS subscales were highest for the isolated ACL-R group, followed by the isolated PCL-R, and lowest for the combined ACL/PCL-R groups. Significant improvements were observed across all treatment groups in the majority of KOOS subscales between the preoperative, and 1- and 2-year follow-ups. All treatment groups showed the greatest improvements between the preoperative and 2-year follow-ups in the knee-related quality of life (mean improvement: isolated ACL-R, + 28 points; isolated PCL-R, + 23 points; combined ACL/PCL-R, + 21 points) and the function in sport and recreation (mean improvement: isolated ACL-R, + 26 points; isolated PCL-R, + 20 points; combined ACL/PCL-R, + 19 points) subscales. Conclusion: Clinically relevant improvements in knee function can be expected after isolated ACL-R, isolated PCL-R, and combined ACL/PCL-R. Functional improvements were particularly pronounced in the KOOS function in sport and recreation subscale, indicating the importance of knee stability for sports activity. This study facilitates more comprehensive patient education about functional expectations after surgical treatment of isolated and combined ACL and PCL injuries.

Methods: Three databases (MEDLINE, PubMed and EMBASE) were searched from inception to April 27th, 2023 for studies investigating contralateral hamstring autografts in primary or revision ACLR. The authors adhered to the PRISMA and R-AMSTAR guidelines as well as the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Data on demographics, strength measures, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), and rates of positive Lachman test, positive pivot-shift test and graft rupture were extracted. PROMs included Lysholm, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Tegner scores. Results: Nine studies comprising 371 patients were included in this review. In primary ACLR, there were no significant differences between contralateral and ipsilateral groups in isokinetic hamstring torque in the non-ACLR limb or isokinetic quadriceps torque in both limbs when tested at 60, 90, 120 or 180 degrees/second. Isokinetic hamstring torque in the non-ACLR limb was significantly weaker in the contralateral group at six months for primary ACLR; however, these deficits did not persist. There were no significant differences in postoperative median Tegner scores and Lysholm scores between contralateral and ipsilateral groups in primary ACLR. There were no significant differences in postoperative median Tegner, mean Lysholm and IKDC scores between groups in revision ACLR. There were no significant differences in positive Lachman, positive pivot-shift and rupture rates in primary ACLR between groups. Rates of positive Lachman and pivot-shift were slightly higher in the contralateral than ipsilateral group for revision ACLR. Conclusion: Contralateral hamstring autografts results in comparable muscle strength to ipsilateral hamstring autografts, with the exception of weaker hamstring strengths in the early postoperative period. Patient-reported outcome measures were similar between the two groups across both primary and revision ACLR, with rates of instability and failure being similar between groups for primary ACLR. Contralateral hamstring grafts do not provide additional benefit when compared to ipsilateral options for either primary or revision ACLR, and should be used only in select circumstances including insufficient ipsilateral hamstring grafts or situations where quadriceps or patella autografts are not optimal.

However, traffic safety concerns among pedestrians could reduce walking behaviour. Safety concerns are generally measured through risk perceptions. Unfortunately, a lack of theoretical development of risk perceptions in walking behaviour research has limited our capacity to identify groups of pedestrians who are inequitably affected and address their concerns. To address this gap, the present investigation identified various theory-driven risk dimensions (i.e., mechanism of injury, temporal risk dimensions, and information processing). Logistic and hierarchical linear regression analyses were used to investigate the effect of the risk dimensions on walking behaviour while considering psychosocial factors (e.g., attitudes and social norms).

The present study aims to better understand the motivation to exercise in group of independently living active older adults. A qualitative research method DIPEx was applied using thematic analysis. The analyzed 34 interviews defined five general themes: (a) Exercise as an expression of the will to live: An attempt to slow down and reverse the aging process; (b) Exercise as a way to get closer to people; (c) Exercise as a part of identity; (d) Exercise aiming to preserve or improve health; (e) Exercise for the sheer joy of the physical activity. Another finding is that more frequent exercise was facilitated by more intrinsic types of motivation while the less frequent exercising groups valued more the social and health impact of exercise. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",DIPEx; Motivation; older adults; physical activity; thematic analysis,,"""Physical Activity and Health Outcomes in Aging Populations""",Physical Activity and Health in Older Adults,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

This study aimed to subgroup and compare chronic knee pain patients according to their CPM responses. Methods: This explorative, cross-sectional study included 127 patients with chronic knee pain (osteoarthritis or following total knee arthroplasty). Individual CPM responses were categorized as facilitatory (test stimuli pain intensity increased when conditioning stimuli were applied), as inhibitory (test stimuli pain intensity decreased) or as no change (defined as less than 5.3% change in pain intensity). Outcomes were clinical pain intensities, temporal summation, widespread pain, self-reported physical function, PainDETECT questionnaire and Pain Quality Assessment Scale. Data were analysed as comparisons between the inhibitory and the facilitatory groups and using multivariate linear regression models. Results: Fifty-four patients had facilitatory CPM responses, 49 had inhibitory CPM responses, and 24 showed no change in CPM response. A between-group difference was observed for self-reported physical function, with the facilitatory CPM group reporting better function (54.4 vs. 46.0, p = 0.028) and the facilitatory CPM group reported more deep pain sensations (3.2 vs. 2.0, p = 0.021). The remaining outcomes showed no between-group differences. Higher clinical pain intensity and facilitated temporal summation were associated in the facilitated CPM group but not in the inhibitory CPM group. Conclusion: These explorative findings indicated that quantitative clinical and experimental differences exist between facilitatory or inhibitory CPM responses in a chronic knee pain patient population. Differences in patients’ CPM responses should be further investigated to unravel possible clinical importance. Significance: Our findings confirm that conditioned pain modulation consist of inhibitory and facilitatory responders among a patient population with chronic knee pain. This explorative study indicates that patients with either facilitatory or inhibitory conditioned pain modulation could exhibit differences in pain outcomes. Subgrouping of chronic pain patients depending on individual conditioned pain modulation responses could be considered in phenotyping patients prior to inclusion in clinical trials or used for personalizing the management regime. © 2023 The Authors.

Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 1,862 patients who underwent hip arthroscopy for FAIS from January 2012 to April 2017. Patients who underwent RHA were propensity matched in a 1:4 ratio by age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and exercise status to patients who underwent primary HA. Preoperative and postoperative radiographs were assessed. Patient-reported outcomes before and at 5 years after surgery, including the Hip Outcome Score Activities of Daily Living subscale (HOS-ADL) and Sports subscale (HOS-SS), modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), international Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-12), and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for Pain and Satisfaction, were compared between groups. Minimally clinically important difference and patient-acceptable symptomatic state (PASS) achievement rates were compared using previously published thresholds. Results: Fifty-one patients who underwent RHA (35 female, 16 male; age 36.2 ± 10.2 years; BMI 26.5 ± 5.9) were followed up for 63.9 ± 9.2 months and then propensity matched in a 1:4 ratio by sex, age, and BMI to 204 control patients who underwent primary HA. At midterm follow-up, patients in the RHA cohort had significantly lower scores for HOS-SS (RHA 64.9 ± 32.5 vs HA 75.3 ± 26.2, P = .044), mHHS (RHA 72.2 ± 22.4 vs HA 80.1 ± 18.1, P = .039), and iHOT-12 (RHA 61.4 ± 29.3 vs HA 71 ± 27.6, P = .043) compared to primary HA patients. Rates of achieving PASS were significantly decreased for HOS-SS (RHA 38.3% vs HA 55.4%, P = .039) and iHOT-12 (RHA 41.9% vs HA 59.9%, P = .035) in the RHA cohort. There were no significant differences in rates of conversion to THA or subsequent reoperation on the index hip between groups. Conclusions: Patients undergoing revision hip arthroscopy demonstrate comparable survivability and magnitude of improvement but may experience worse overall outcome scores and meet thresholds for clinically significant outcomes less often when compared to primary hip arthroscopy patients.

However, it assesses only the active and passive flexibility of posterior thigh muscles. This may lead the practitioner to underestimate a compensation or abnormal movement pattern. The aim of this study was to analyze these kinematic aspects and their reliability, and evaluate the hamstring (HM) and gluteus maximus (GM) muscles' activities. Twelve healthy male volunteers were tested during two session of three trials for passive and active tests. Dynamic flexibility (97.2 ± 6.0°) was significantly greater than the passive one (70.5 ± 14.7°) (p < 0.001), and good intra-individual reproductibility for most kinematic characteristics was observed. Biceps Femoris long head, semitendinosus and GM mean activities (20.1 ± 11.2%; 14.3 ± 7.3% and 25.2 ± 22.1%, respectively) were found to be low to moderate, indicating that only a moderate level of activity occurred during the active H-test, in comparison to other movements such as sprinting itself. In addition, the activity of the posterior thigh muscles during the active H-test appeared to be variable among the volunteers. These findings suggest that the H-test should be interpreted on an individual basis rather than relying on general characteristics, and be considered as an intermediate tool before more strenuous activities such as returning to sprint. With this comprehensive approach, clinicians can gain a more accurate understanding of their patients' progress and make more informed decisions about their readiness to return to play. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",H-test; Hamstring extensibility; Kinematic analysis; Muscle recruitment; Muscle stiffness,active H test; adult; Article; biceps femoris muscle; controlled study; electromyography; gluteus maximus muscle; hamstring muscle; human; human experiment; kinematics; male; muscle contraction; muscle rigidity; muscle strength; musculoskeletal system examination; neurophysiological recruitment; normal human; observational study; physical activity; range of motion; reliability; reproducibility; semitendinous muscle; sprinting; young adult,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Muscle Strength and Recovery in Sports Performance

A method of collecting multi-position data with a hand-held accelerometer is introduced, and the proposed algorithm is used to in-field calibrate nine parameters of the accelerometer's nonlinear error model. In addition, simulation is used to compare the results of calibrating the accelerometer using the proposed algorithm and the original algorithm, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed algorithm. Finally, experimental results confirm that the proposed method can rapidly calibrate accelerometer error parameters without relying on complex equipment and with greater accuracy than traditional methods. © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",calibration; Inertial Measurement Unit; intelligent optimization algorithm; Northern Goshawk optimization algorithm; three-axis accelerometer,Calibration; Cost functions; Optimization; Cost-function; Field calibration; High costs; In-field; Inertial measurements units; Intelligent optimization algorithm; Northern goshawk optimization algorithm; Optimization algorithms; Three axis accelerometers; Triaxial accelerometer; Accelerometers,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Wearable Devices and Techniques in Gait Analysis and Mobility Rehabilitation

Linear regression models were used to validate the effects of nutrition and exercise on cognitive function and to test their interaction effects with happiness. When the interactions were significant, stratified analyses in sub-groups were conducted. Mediation effects of happiness were examined using two-step causal mediation models. We confirmed that better nutrition (p < 0.001) and exercise (p = 0.009) were significantly associated with less cognitive decline. Furthermore, the effects of nutrition and exercise on cognitive decline were significant in the unhappy (happiness < 20) (p < 0.001) and younger (age < 74) sub-groups (p = 0.015). Happiness partially mediated 11.5% of the negative association of cognitive decline with nutrition (p = 0.015) and 23.0% of that with exercise (p = 0.017). This study suggests that happiness moderates and partially mediates the effects of exercise and nutrition on cognitive status.

Methods: A systematic review was performed by searching PubMed, Web of Science, OVID and EMBASE to identify studies that compared the clinical efficacy of PRP for talar cartilage repair. Main outcome was the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score for function and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain was the second outcome. Results: A total of 10 studies were included in this systematic review, including 4 randomized controlled trials, 1 controlled trial, 3 case series and 2 cohort studies. Four RCTs were analyzed using meta-analysis. For all outcomes, statistical results favored PRP group (AOFAS: MD = 7.84; 95% CI= [-0.13, 15.80], I2 = 83%, P < 0.01; VAS: MD = 1.86; 95% CI= [0.68, 3.04], I2 = 85%, P < 0.01). There were almost no reports of adverse events related to PRP intervention. Subgroup analysis showed that whether PRP was used alone or combined with other treatments could result in high heterogeneity but no more specific factors were identified to contribute to this. Conclusion: PRP is safe and effective for talar cartilage repair. In addition to the standardization of PRP preparation and application, it is necessary to distinguish the effects of PRP used alone or in combination with other treatments. In PRP studies, surgical treatment of talar cartilage repair remains the mainstream. The regulation of PRP in surgical applications are worth exploring. The most relative component is the mesenchymal stem cell because it is the only exposed chondrocyte precursor in the articular cavity whether it is microfracture or cell transplantation.

Patient reported outcomes and healthcare resource use were collected at six and 12 months post injury. Accounting for Rockwood grade, age, gender and dominant arm injury, the operative group had a statistically lower Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) at baseline (10.8 vs 25.3, <0.0001) and at six months (37 vs 43.8, p = 0.024) than the non-operative group.

This study assessed change in PA levels and mental well-being after a motivational interviewing (MI) community-based PA intervention and the impact of signposting (SP) and social action (SA) (i.e. weekly group support) pathways. Methods: Participants (n = 2084) took part in a community-based, primary care PA programme using MI techniques. Self-reported PA and mental well-being data were collected at baseline (following an initial 30-min MI appointment), 12 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. Participants were assigned based upon the surgery they attended to the SP or SA pathway. Multilevel models derived point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for outcomes at each time point and change scores. Results: Participants increased PA and mental well-being at each follow-up time point through both participant pathways and with little difference between pathways. Retention was similar between pathways at 12 weeks, but the SP pathway retained more participants at 6 and 12 months. Conclusions: Both pathways produced similar improvements in PA and mental well-being; however, the addition of a control would have provided further insight as to the effectiveness. Due to lower resources yet similar effects, the SP pathway could be incorporated to support PA in primary care settings.  © 2021 The Author(s).

An unblinded randomized controlled trial was conducted to investigate sex-specific dose–response effects of a 24-week supervised concurrent exercise training program on cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular strength in young adults. One hundred and forty-four sedentary adults aged 18–25 years were assigned to either (i) a control group (n = 54), (ii) a moderate intensity exercise group (MOD-EX, n = 46), or (iii) a vigorous intensity exercise group (VIG-EX, n = 44) by unrestricted randomization. Cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max), hand grip strength, and one-repetition maximum of leg press and bench press were evaluated at baseline and after the intervention. A total of 102 participants finished the intervention (Control, n = 36; 52% women, MOD-EX, n = 37; 70% women, and VIG-EX, n = 36; 72% women). In men, VO2max significantly increased in the MOD-EX (~8%) compared with the control group and in the VIG-EX group after the intervention (~6.5%). In women, VO2max increased in the MOD-EX and VIG-EX groups (~5.5%) compared with the control group after the intervention. There was a significant increment of leg press in the MOD-EX (~15.5%) and VIG-EX (~18%) groups compared with the control group (~1%) in women. A 24-week supervised concurrent exercise was effective at improving cardiorespiratory fitness and lower body limbs muscular strength in young women—independently of the predetermined intensity—while only at moderate intensity improved cardiorespiratory fitness in men. © 2023 The Authors.

Mobility limitations are amongst the most frequent and early markers of MS. We evaluated the effectiveness of a DeepMS2G (deep learning (DL) for MS differentiation using multi-stride dynamics in gait) framework, which is a DL-based methodology to classify multi-stride sequences of persons with MS (PwMS) from healthy controls (HC), in order to generalize over newer walking tasks and subjects. Methods: We collected single-task Walking and dual-task Walking-while-Talking gait data using an instrumented treadmill from a balanced collection of 20 HC and 20 PwMS. We utilized domain knowledge-based spatiotemporal and kinetic gait features along with two normalization schemes, namely standard size-based and multiple regression normalization strategies. To differentiate between multi-stride sequences of HC and PwMS, we compared 16 traditional machine learning and DL algorithms. Further, we studied the interpretability of our highest-performing models; and discussed the association between the lower extremity function of participants and our model predictions. Results: We observed that residual neural network (ResNet) based models with regression-based normalization were the top performers across both task and subject generalization classification designs. Considering regression-based normalization, a multi-scale ResNet attained a subject classification accuracy and F$_{1}$-score of 1.0 when generalizing from single-task Walking to dual-task Walking-while-Talking; and a ResNet resulted in the top subject-wise accuracy and F$_{1}$ of 0.83 and 0.81 (resp.), when generalizing over unseen participants. Conclusion: We used advanced DL and dynamics across domain knowledge-based spatiotemporal and kinetic gait parameters to successfully classify MS gait across distinct walking trials and unseen participants. Significance: Our proposed DL algorithms might contribute to efforts to automate MS diagnoses. © 1964-2012 IEEE.",Deep learning; gait; multiple sclerosis,Deep Learning; Exercise Test; Gait; Humans; Multiple Sclerosis; Walking; Classification (of information); Deep learning; Domain Knowledge; Feature extraction; Gait analysis; Pulse width modulation; Deep learning; Features extraction; Gait; Healthy controls; Legged locomotion; Multiple sclerosis; Normalisation; Pulsewidth modulations (PWM); Spatiotemporal phenomenon; Task analysis; adaptive boosting; adult; aged; area under the curve; Article; binary classification; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; convolutional neural network; cross validation; deep learning; demographics; Expanded Disability Status Scale; extreme gradient boosting; feature extraction; female; gait; gated recurrent unit network; ground reaction force; human; knowledge; logistic regression analysis; long short term memory network; machine learning; male; multi scale residual neural network; multilayer perceptron; multiple regression; multiple sclerosis; prediction; random forest; recurrent neural network; residual neural network; spatiotemporal analysis; standing; stride length; stride time; stride width; support vector machine; telephone interview; temporal convolutional network; vanilla recurrent neural network; walking difficulty; exercise test; gait; physiology; psychology; walking; Regression analysis,"""Application of Machine Learning and Biomechanics in Musculoskeletal Health and Wearable Devices""","Knee Assessment and Recovery: Validity, Reliability, and Clinical Trials",Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

One reason of potentially several is that subjective monitoring affords athletes to give dishonest responses. Indeed, athletes have never been systematically researched to understand why they are honest or not. Objective: Because we do not know what motivates professional athletes to be honest or not when responding to subjective monitoring, our objective is to explore the motives for why the athlete may or may not respond honestly. Methods: A qualitative and phenomenological approach was used, interviewing 11 world-class team-sport athletes (five women, six men) about their experiences when asked to respond to subjective monitoring questionnaires. Interview transcripts were read in full and significant quotations/statements extracted. Meanings were formulated for each interviewees’ story and assigned codes. Codes were reflected upon and labelled as categories, with similar categories grouped into an overall theme. Themes were examined, articulated, re-interpreted, re-formulated, and written as a thematic story, drawing on elements reported from different athletes creating a blended story, allowing readers a feel for what it is like to live the experience. Results: Overall, four key themes emerged: (i) pursuit of the ideal-self, (ii) individual barriers to athlete engagement, (iii) social facilitators to athlete engagement; and (iv) feeling compassion from performance staff. Conclusions: Our main insight is that athletes’ emotions play a major role in whether they respond honestly or not, with these emotions being driven at least in part by the performance staff asking the questions. © 2023, The Author(s).",,Athletes; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Motivation; Surveys and Questionnaires; Team Sports; adult; article; athlete; clinical article; drawing; emotion; female; genetic transcription; human; human experiment; interview; male; professional athlete; qualitative research; questionnaire; team sport; emotion; motivation; psychology; questionnaire,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Dysfunction and X-ray changes of TMJ were described only in few observational studies. Treatment as well has been seldom considered. Aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects on TMJ of two specifically designed physiotherapy protocols. Methods: The study group included 26 SSc outpatients (22 females and 4 males with mean age ± SD 59.08 ± 10.31 years). Thirteen patients were randomly assigned to a treatment (protocol 1) including home exercises for TMJ and thirteen to a treatment (protocol 2) including home exercises and a combined procedure. The rehabilitation effects on the TMJ were evaluated by ultrasound examination (UE) in static and dynamic phases. UE was performed in all patients before and at the end of the treatment and after a follow up (8 weeks). Results: Both rehabilitation protocols induced a significant improvement (protocol 1: p < 0.01 and protocol 2: p < 0.005) of mouth opening with a long-lasting effect. Protocol 2 was more effective than protocol 1. A significant increase of bilateral condyle-head temporal bone distance was detected by UE at the end of both treatments. It was maintained at follow-up in patients treated with Protocol 2. Conclusions: The present investigation shows that a rehabilitation program characterized by home exercises with a combined procedure is useful to recover the function of TMJ. The data also show that UE is helpful in the evaluation of TMJ in SSc and in the assessment of the efficacy of the rehabilitation programs. © 2023, The Author(s).",Rehabilitation; Systemic sclerosis; Temporomandibular joint; Ultrasound examination,,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Management and Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

Data on PA and SED are often self-reported in clinical practice and, hence, reliable and valid questionnaires are crucial. This study aimed to assess the test–retest reliability, criterion validity and agreement of two PA and one SED questionnaire commonly used in clinical practice, developed by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare (BHW) and the Swedish national quality register SWEDEHEART. Data from 57 patients (mean age 66 ± 9.2 years, 42 males) was included in this multi-centre study. The patients answered three questionnaires on PA and SED at seven-day intervals and wore an accelerometer for seven days. Test–retest reliability, criterion validity and agreement were assessed using Spearman’s rho and linearly weighted kappa. Test–retest reliability was moderate for three of the six-sub questions (k = 0.43–0.54) within the PA questionnaires. For criterion validity, the correlation was fair within three of the six sub-questions (r = 0.41–0.50) within the PA questionnaires. The SED questionnaire had low agreement (k = 0.12) and criterion validity (r = 0.30). The studied questionnaires for PA could be used in clinical practice as a screening tool and/or to evaluate the level of PA in patients with an MI. Future research is recommended to develop and/or evaluate SED questionnaires in patients with an MI. © 2023 by the authors.",accelerometer; cardiac rehabilitation; myocardial infarction; physical activity; sedentary time; self-report,Aged; Exercise; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Reproducibility of Results; Sedentary Behavior; Self Report; Sweden; accelerometer; cardiovascular disease; lifestyle; physical activity; questionnaire survey; reliability analysis; aged; algorithm; Article; body mass; clinical practice; criterion related validity; exercise; female; gait; heart infarction; heart rehabilitation; human; interrater reliability; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; physical activity; practice guideline; questionnaire; sedentary time; self report; test retest reliability; validity; welfare; clinical trial; heart infarction; middle aged; reproducibility; sedentary lifestyle,"""Physical Activity and Health Outcomes in Aging Populations""",Physical Activity and Health in Older Adults,Physical Activity and Health Risks

Methods: A retrospective review of all MLB athletes who underwent arthroscopic shoulder labrum repair from 2002 to 2020 was performed. Players with a history of instability events were excluded. A 2:1 control cohort of healthy MLB players were matched to the operative cohort by age, years of experience, position, height, and body mass index (BMI). Player demographics, game utilization, and performance metrics were collected for all players. Results: Twenty-six of 39 MLB pitchers (66%) and 18 of 25 (72%) positional players, who underwent arthroscopic shoulder labral repair RTP, with 46.2% of pitchers and 72% of positional players successfully RTP. At one season postsurgery, pitchers and positional players experienced a significant reduction in games played compared to their one season preinjury (44.7 ± 29.3 vs 109.5 ± 73.2 games; P < .001 and 75.7 ± 47.1 vs 98.0 ± 50.7 games; P = .04). When compared with matched controls at one season postinjury, pitchers had significantly fewer runs allowed per 9 innings (5.8 ± 2.0 vs 4.3 ± 1.4; P = .0061) and walk and hits per inning pitched (WHIP) (1.5 ± 0.3 vs 1.3 ± 0.2; P = .0035), while positional players had worse on-base percentage (0.3 ± 0.1 vs 0.3 ± 0.1; P = .0116). Both pitchers and positional players experienced significantly shorter career lengths after surgery (P = .002) when compared to controls. Conclusions: Following arthroscopic shoulder labral surgery, most MLB pitchers and positional players were able to RTP successfully but experienced shorter careers thereafter. These players also experienced declines in game utilization and performance one season after surgery but were able to return to baseline at 3 seasons after surgery.

However, the effects of IMPA on various parameters in swimmers are still unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of IMPA on the mechanical parameters, physiological responses, and their possible correlations with swimming performance. A total of 14 young swimmers (aged 16 ± 0 years) underwent a 30-s all-out tethered swimming test, preceded or not by IMPA, a load of 40% of the maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), and with a volume of 2 sets of 15 repetitions. The mechanical (strength, impulse, and fatigue index) and physiological parameters (skin temperature and lactatemia) and the assessment of perceived exertion and dyspnea were monitored in both protocols. The IMPA used did not increase the swimming force, and skin temperature, decrease blood lactate concentration, or subjective perception of exertion and dyspnea after the high-intensity tethered swimming exercises. Positive correlations were found between mean force and blood lactate (without IMPA: r = 0.62, P = 0.02; with IMPA: r = 0.65, P = 0.01). The impulse was positively correlated with blood lactate (without IMPA: r = 0.71, P < 0.01; with IMPA: r = 0.56, P = 0.03). Our results suggest that new IMPA protocols, possibly with increased volume, should be developed in order to improve the performance of young swimmers. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Athletic Performance; Dyspnea; Humans; Lactates; Muscles; Skin Temperature; Swimming; lactic acid derivative; athletic performance; dyspnea; human; muscle; physiology; skin temperature; swimming,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Physiological and Biomechanical Responses in Sports Performance

Methods: In this prospective randomized clinical trial, patients were assigned to tourniquet inflation (tourniquet-up) or tourniquet deflation (tourniquet-down) groups. Primary outcomes were intraoperative visualization with operative time and sterile saline consumption. Secondary outcomes were intra- and postoperative blood loss, postoperative pain, opioid consumption, swelling, serum CPK, Hb concentration, subjective and objective functional scores, and graft healing. Results: Intraoperative visualization was satisfactory in 100 of 100 cases in the tourniquet-up group and 64 of 100 cases in the tourniquet-down group (P < .05). The mean operative time was 58.4 ± 5.7 minutes in the tourniquet-up group and 72.5 ± 8.6 minutes in the tourniquet-down group (P < .05). The mean sterile saline consumption was 6.4 ± 2.5 L in the tourniquet-up group and 8.7 ± 4.6 L in the tourniquet-down group (P < .05). The respective amounts of estimated intraoperative and postoperative blood loss were 95.3 ± 25.1 mL and 240.3 ± 44.5 mL in the tourniquet-up group and 230.2 ± 22.3 mL and 75.6 ± 15.3 mL in the tourniquet-down group (P < .05).

Rate perceived exertion (RPE) and session-rate perceived exertion (sRPE) were registered for every training and game session. After that, acute and chronic workloads were calculated, and ACWR was subsequently derived from them. Furthermore, non-contact injuries were registered during the mentioned period. The main findings were: there is a poor correlation between the ACWR and non-contact injuries (r=0.069 (p<0.05)) and, the use of the ACWR by itself is insufficient to predict the occurrence of non-contact injuries in a semiprofessional football team.

It has excellent inter-rater and test-retest reliabilities, but it is unknown how accurately Johns Hopkins Highest Level of Mobility documentation reflects the patients’ mobility performance in the immediate postoperative period compared to objective measures such as accelerometers. Methods: In this single-center observational study, consented adults undergoing open abdominal surgery wore a research-grade accelerometer, activPAL, starting immediately postoperatively until hospital discharge or up to 7 days. We collected the Johns Hopkins Highest Level of Mobility scores documented by hospital staff via retrospective chart review and evaluated their accuracy in describing the type, frequency, and volume of postoperative out-of-bed mobilization using the activPAL as the criterion. Results: We analyzed data from 56 participants. The activPAL showed that participants spent 97.7% of their time lying in bed or sitting in a chair. Meanwhile, the Johns Hopkins Highest Level of Mobility documentation of preambulatory activities (scores 1–5) was rare. The activPAL detected 4 times more out-of-bed mobilization than routine Johns Hopkins Highest Level of Mobility documentation. Whereas the frequency of activPAL-measured out-of-bed mobilization increased steadily to a median of 9 sessions by postoperative day 6, the number of Johns Hopkins Highest Level of Mobility documentation remained around twice daily. ActivPAL measurements demonstrated that Johns Hopkins Highest Level of Mobility documentation of ambulatory sessions (scores 6–8) was accurate. Conclusions: We found that routine Johns Hopkins Highest Level of Mobility documentation did not accurately detect preambulatory activities or the overall frequency of out-of-bed mobility sessions, poorly reflecting the highly sedentary behaviors of the acute postoperative inpatients and highlighting the need to improve clinical documentation or use alternative methods to track postoperative mobilization. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",,Adult; Hospitals; Humans; Inpatients; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies; abdominal surgery; adult; Article; controlled study; female; human; hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy; hysterectomy; Johns Hopkins Highest Level of Mobility scale; major clinical study; male; mobilization; nephrectomy; observational study; pancreaticoduodenectomy; patient mobility; physical mobility; prospective study; recumbency; sedentary time; hospital; hospital patient; reproducibility; retrospective study,"""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Wearable Devices and Techniques in Gait Analysis and Mobility Rehabilitation

Methods: A total of 947 adults with dyslipidemia (STRRIDE I, STRRIDE AT/RT) or prediabetes (STRRIDE-PD) were randomized to either inactive control or to 1 of 10 exercise interventions, ranging from doses of 8–23 kcal/kg/week, intensities of 50%–75% (Formula presented.) peak, and durations of 6–8 months. Two groups included resistance training, and one included a dietary intervention (7% weight loss goal). Dropout was defined as an individual withdrawn from the study, with the reasons for dropout aggregated into determinant categories. Timing of dropout was defined as the last session attended and aggregated into phases (i.e., “ramp” period to allow gradual adaptation to exercise prescription). Utilizing descriptive statistics, percentages were generated according to categories of determinants and timing of dropout to describe the proportion of individuals who fell within each category. Results: Black men and women were more likely to be lost to follow-up (Black men: 31.3% and Black women: 19.6%), or dropout due to work responsibilities (15.6% and 12.5%), “change of mind” (12.5% and 8.9%), transportation issues (6.3% and 3.6%), or reported lack of motivation (6.3% and 3.6%). Women in general noted lack of time more often than men as a reason for dropout (White women: 22.4% and Black women: 22.1%). Regardless of race and sex, most participants dropped out during the ramp period of the exercise intervention; with Black women (50%) and White men (37.1%) having the highest dropout rate during this period. Conclusion: These findings emphasize the importance of targeted retention strategies when aiming to address race and sex differences that exist in determinants and timing of dropout among individuals enrolled in an exercise and/or caloric restriction intervention. 2023 Collins, Huffman, Wolever, Smith, Siegler, Ross, Jakicic, Costa and Kraus.",adherence; health disparity; lifestyle intervention; non-compliance; retention,,"""Physical Activity and Health Outcomes in Aging Populations""",Physical Activity and Health in Older Adults,Physical Activity and Health Risks

The aim, therefore, of the present study was to examine the effect of 8 weeks of an individualized corrective exercise intervention program on musculoskeletal asymmetries in young soccer players. Materials and Methods: Eighty young male soccer players (age: 14.4 ± 1.2 years; body height: 166.3 ± 9.6 cm; body mass: 59.1 ± 11.5 kg) participated in the current laboratory-based study. A battery of postural and musculoskeletal asymmetry evaluations were initially performed. After the completion of the initial assessment, each player was provided with an individual musculoskeletal asymmetry corrective exercise intervention program which lasted for 8-weeks, with the aim of restoring muscular asymmetries. Following the application of the intervention program, a re-evaluation of their musculoskeletal asymmetries was performed. Results: There was a significant improvement in the primary angle of trunk rotation (r = −0.56, p < 0.001), hamstring flexibility (right: r = −0.55, p < 0.001; left: r = −0.48, p < 0.001), hip external rotation (right: r = −0.46, p < 0.001; left: r = −0.26, p = 0.020), hip internal rotation (right: r = −0.26, p = 0.021; left: r = −0.35, p = 0.002), the opened-eyes Stork Test (right: r = −0.33, p = 0.003: left: r = −0.33, p = 0.003), the closed-eyes Stork Test (right: r = −0.39, p < 0.001; left: r = −0.43, p < 0.001), the Thomas test [right: (χ2(3) = 52.281, p = 0.001, (Formula presented.) = −0.751; left: (χ2(3) = 45.832, p = 0.001, (Formula presented.) = −0.696)] and of ankle prone passive dorsiflexion (flexed knees) (χ2(2) = 13.019, p = 0.005, V = 0.285).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of bouldering on upper and lower limb muscle strength and body balance. Material and Methods. The study group consisted of 22 climbers (aged 27.23 ± 4.81) with at least 2 years of bouldering experience, while the control group consisted of 20 men (aged 23.10 ± 5.28) not practicing rock climbing. The study received approval from the local bioethical commission in Poland. Static and dynamic stabilographic parameters were measured with eyes open (EO) and closed (EC) on the Biodex Balance System SD USA (BBS) platform. Subsequently, the maximum muscle torques of the elbow, hip, knee and ankle joints were measured in isometric conditions. Hand-grip strength (HGS) with and without the thumb was assessed using a handheld dynamometer. Results. Climbers achieved significantly higher values of HGS with the thumb of both hands (p < 0.005), foot extensors strength (FES) in both limbs (p < 0.05) and left hip extensors (HES L) (p < 0.05). They also achieved significantly lower values of all stabilographic parameters, indicating better balance compared to the control group (p < 0.05). An interaction of HES x SIDE across the groups was observed (F(1,40) = 13.588, p < 0.001 η2 = 0.254). Moreover, there was a statistically significant negative correlation of ankle extensors strength with medial-lateral stability index (MLSI EC) (right: r = -0.418; left: r = -0.331) and fall risk index (FRI6-2) (right: r = -0.520; left: r = -0.435). Conclusions. Regular climbing training develops muscle strength, especially FES, HES, HGS, and improves balance. Climbing can be used for prevention of muscle weakness and equilibrium disorders. © 2023 Sciendo.

The aim of his study was to determine the prevalence of WMSDs, estimate the likelihood of subsequent disorders, and investigate the effect of NASM-based training protocol on firefighters function. Method: First, prevalence and region of WMSDs in all 524 male Isfahan firefighters were determined by Medical-history-questionnaire. Then, functional movement screen (FMS) separated firefighters to the 2-dimension FMS score (FMSCS≤14 or FMSCS>14) to show at risk firefighters. Finally, 40 Participants with both FMSCS≤14 and common WMSDs randomly assigned to either an intervention (IG) (n = 20) or control (CG) (n = 20) group. The IG received NASM-based training, while the CG engaged in daily activities. Outcomes included movement efficiency during landing error scoring system-real time, Y balance, single-leg squat, and deep squat, which were assessed in pretest and posttest. Results: The prevalence of disorders was 52.1%, which lower limb, back, upper limb, and neck were the highest prevalence respectively. Only lower limb and back disorders could identify individuals at disorder risk with a likelihood of 89% and 71%, sequentially. Also, movement performance significantly improved in all functional tests in IG relative to CG. Conclusions: Considering high disorder rate in firefighters, the value of our study lies in alleging a systematic model periodically to reduce WMSDs and risk of subsequent disorders. Not only our model determined the prevalence of WMSDs, but it also identified those who are at risk. In addition, our model represents exercise therapy as a solution. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Functional test; Lower extremity; Musculoskeletal abnormalities; Occupational health; Prevalence study,Firefighters; Humans; Male; Movement; Musculoskeletal Diseases; Occupational Diseases; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; adult; arm injury; Article; body equilibrium; body movement; clinical article; controlled study; daily life activity; fire fighter; functional assessment; functional movement screen; human; kinesiotherapy; leg injury; leg movement; male; musculoskeletal disease; neck injury; occupational accident; outcome assessment; prevalence; questionnaire; risk assessment; risk reduction; squatting (position); training; movement (physiology); musculoskeletal disease; occupational disease; risk factor,"""Pain Management and Musculoskeletal Health in Various Populations""",Chronic Pain Management and Treatment Studies,Evaluation and Improvement of Postural Balance and Muscle Strength

Post-COVID-19 syndrome, also known as long COVID or long-haul COVID, refers to a persistent condition where individuals experience symptoms and health issues after the acute phase of COVID-19. The aim of this study was to assess the strength and fatigue of skeletal muscles in people recovered from COVID-19. A total of 94 individuals took part in this cross-sectional study, with 45 participants (referred to as the Post-COVID Cohort, PCC) and 49 healthy age-matched volunteers (Healthy Control Cohort, HCC). This research article uses the direct dynamometry method to provide a detailed analysis of post-COVID survivors’ strength and power characteristics. The Biodex System 4 Pro was utilized to evaluate muscle strength characteristics during the fatigue test. The fatigue work in extensors and flexors was significantly higher in the PCC. The PCC also showed significantly less power in both extensors and flexors compared to the HCC. In conclusion, this study provides compelling evidence of the impact of post-COVID-19 fatigue on muscle performance, highlighting the importance of considering these effects in the rehabilitation and care of individuals recovering from the virus.

Recently, mat-based proprioceptive training has assumed a key role in recovery from these disorders. Therefore, this proof-of-principle study aimed to assess the efficacy of proprioceptive mat training on plantar pressures and athletic performance in volleyball players. The participants included adult semi-professional volleyball players allocated into two groups: an experimental group, with mat-based proprioceptive and balance training, and a control group, with a sham protocol. For the outcome, we evaluated the barefoot plantar pressure, performing an analysis on a baropodometric resistive platform. The countermovement jump and squat jump were measured using an inertial measurement unit. Nineteen subjects were included in the two groups: the active proprioceptive group (n = 10) or the control group (n = 9). The results show a more uniform redistribution of loads with pressure hindfoot relief in the experimental group compared to the control group (p = 0.021, RBC = 0.67). Moreover, we observed a significant increase in peak landing force and high concentric power development in the experimental group compared to the controls. Focused proprioceptive management provided hindfoot load attenuation by stimulating higher peaks of concentric force in the experimental group compared to the sham group. Even though the study included a small sample, the results obtained in this proof-of-principle study suggest a positive role of proprioceptive stimulation in the inter-seasonal scenario for volleyball players to improve their jump performance and reduce the micro-traumatisms of the heel fat pad and the ankle injury rate. However, further studies performed on larger samples are needed to confirm these preliminary results. © 2023 by the authors.",baropodometric analysis; inertial sensor; mat-based; performance; proprioception; rehabilitation; volleyball,Adipose Tissue; Adult; Ankle Injuries; Athletic Performance; Humans; Social Group; Volleyball; Baropodometric analyse; Control groups; Experimental groups; Inertial sensor; Mat-based; Performance; Plantar pressures; Proof of principles; Volleyball; Volleyball players; adipose tissue; adult; ankle injury; athletic performance; human; volleyball; Sports,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Effects of different training methods on athletic performance and injury prevention

It makes the patient complain of knee pain, tends to immobilize, and induced neural inhibition (Arthrogenic muscle inhibition) on the quadriceps muscle as a knee stabilator and shock absorbent. These caused quadriceps weakness. The combination of blood flow restriction (BFR) and low-intensity resistance training (LIRT) showed an improvement in isotonic peak torque significantly, but the prescription is varied and limited in Indonesia. Patient and Methods: This was a clinical experimental study with randomized control trial with pre and post-test design. The subjects were 28 KOA patients (50-70 years old). The intervention group (n=14) received a combination of low-load resistance training (30% 1-RM; 75 repetitions) and BFR (50 mmHg). The control group (n=14) received low load resistance training only (30% 1-RM; 75 repetitions). Both groups received training 2 times per week with a Q-bench machine for 6 weeks. Isokinetic peak torque was assessed before and after the training program. Results: There was a significant improvement in isokinetic peak torque before and after the training program in both groups (intervention group p=0.001; control group p=0.000). There was a significant improvement of delta isokinetic peak torque between both groups (p=0.018) and post-test between both groups (p=0.044). The effect size value of the intervention group was 1.22 (very large) and the control group was 0.89 (large). Conclusions: The addition of BFR on LIRT for 6 weeks can improve isokinetic quadriceps strength in patients with knee osteoarthritis. © 2023, Sanglah General Hospital.

It can occur in previously healthy and anatomically normal knees, but there are several abnormalities that predispose to patellar instability. Magnetic resonance imaging is an essential part of assessing for associated injuries and risk of further instability. Treatment aims to prevent redislocation, residual instability, osteoarthritis, and allow return to previous activities. The purpose of this review was to assess evidence for management of first-time patella dislocation in children and adolescents. Methods: Literature review was performed, accompanied by the current best practice by the authors. Results: Non-operative treatment is preferred, except where there are associated injuries such as osteochondral fractures that would benefit from surgery. The exact method of ideal non-operative management is not clearly defined but should focus on restoration of range of movement and strength with bracing as indicated. There seems to be a trend toward operative intervention that may well be inappropriate. Conclusion: Further prospective studies are required with focus on the younger patient to fully understand if there is an at-risk group that would benefit from early surgery.

These risk factors were subsequently used in ACL injury prevention measures. Due to the lack of ecological validity, the use of on-field data in the ACL injury risk screening is increasingly advocated. Though, the kinematic differences between laboratory and on-field settings have never been investigated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the lower-limb kinematics of female footballers during agility movements performed both in laboratory and football field environments. Twenty-eight healthy young female talented football (soccer) players (14.9 ± 0.9 years) participated. Lower-limb joint kinematics was collected through wearable inertial sensors (Xsens Link) in three conditions: (1) laboratory setting during unanticipated sidestep cutting at 40-50°; on the football pitch (2) football-specific exercises (F-EX) and (3) football games (F-GAME). A hierarchical two-level random effect model in Statistical Parametric Mapping was used to compare joint kinematics among the conditions. Waveform consistency was investigated through Pearson’s correlation coefficient and standardized z-score vector. In-lab kinematics differed from the on-field ones, while the latter were similar in overall shape and peaks. Lower sagittal plane range of motion, greater ankle eversion, and pelvic rotation were found for on-field kinematics (p < 0.044). The largest differences were found during landing and weight acceptance. The biomechanical differences between lab and field settings suggest the application of context-related adaptations in female footballers and have implications in ACL injury prevention strategies. Highlights Talented youth female football players showed kinematical differences between the lab condition and the on-field ones, thus adopting a context-related motor strategy. Lower sagittal plane range of motion, greater ankle eversion, and pelvic rotation were found on the field. Such differences pertain to the ACL injury mechanism and prevention strategies. Preventative training should support the adoption of non-linear motor learning to stimulate greater self-organization and adaptability. It is recommended to test football players in an ecological environment to improve subsequent primary ACL injury prevention programmes. © 2022 European College of Sport Science.",ACL; female football; field; IMU; kinematics; laboratory,Adolescent; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Biomechanical Phenomena; Female; Football; Humans; Knee Joint; Lower Extremity; Soccer; adolescent; anterior cruciate ligament injury; biomechanics; female; football; human; knee; lower limb; soccer,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Effects of Training Protocols on Injury Prevention and Performance in Soccer and Futsal Players

This study investigated (a) whether encounters with friends and the quality of these encounters were associated with cardiovascular reactivity in everyday life and (b) whether these associations varied by race. Method: Participants were from the Stress and Well-being in Everyday Life Study which included Black (n=76; aged = 34–76) and White (n=87, aged = 34–91) adults residing in the United States. Participants provided background and social network information in a baseline interview, followed by a 4-day ecological momentary assessment in which they reported social encounters every 3 hr. Concurrently, participants wore an electrocardiogram monitor which collected physiological data in real time. To assess cardiovascular reactivity, heart rate variability (HRV) was analyzed. Results: Multilevel models revealed that at times when individuals encountered friends (particularly positive encounters), they exhibited a momentary reduction in HRV (within-person association). But those with more friend encounters during the study period (particularly positive encounters) had higher HRV than those with fewer friend encounters during the study period (between-person association). These links were observed only among Black adults, but not among White adults. Conclusions: This study contributes to the conceptual model of social integration and enriches the literature on racial disparities in cardiovascular health from a social perspective. Findings highlight the implications of engagement with friends for momentary cardiovascular reactivity and suggest that friends may be more salient for Black adults’ cardiovascular health. © 2023 American Psychological Association",ambulatory assessments; friendships; heart rate variability; racial differences; social determinants of health,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Black or African American; Cardiovascular System; Emotions; Friends; Health Inequities; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Middle Aged; United States; White; adult; aged; Article; Black person; cardiovascular function; cardiovascular response; Caucasian; conceptual model; controlled study; ecological momentary assessment; electrocardiography monitoring; female; friendship; heart rate variability; human; integration; interview; male; multilevel analysis; physiological process; physiological stress; race difference; racial disparity; social background; social determinants of health; social interaction; social network; United States; wellbeing; African American; cardiovascular system; emotion; epidemiology; friend; health disparity; human relation; middle aged; very elderly","""Physical Activity and Health Outcomes in Aging Populations""",Physical Activity and Health in Older Adults,Physical Activity and Health Risks

Introduction: A strength imbalance between the shoulder rotator muscles of overhead athletes is a predisposing factor to shoulder injuries. As very little research has been done on cricketers, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of shoulder rotator muscle imbalance in a population of collegiate cricket bowlers by assessing the isokinetic strength of shoulder external and internal rotators. Also, comparison was done between the concentric and eccentric torques at different velocities. Method: Isokinetic shoulder rotational strength was evaluated in 42 male cricket bowlers with a mean age of 22.02 years and a mean BMI of 22.33 kg/m2. The Biodex System 4 Pro Isokinetic Dynamometer was used to collect data on shoulder rotation strength in a seated position. Data were collected at two speeds (180 and 240deg/sec) and computed for peak torque values for the dominant shoulder's functional external eccentric-to-internal concentric ratio. Result: At a speed of 180deg/sec, 40 bowlers and 240deg/s, 37 bowlers demonstrated lower functional ratios and shoulder muscle imbalance. Conclusion: A significant fraction of cricket bowlers had shoulder muscle imbalance. This imbalance represents a predisposition to injuries. These strength ratios must be considered when managing cricketers and their injuries. © 2022",Cricket bowlers; Isokinetic strength ratios; Peak torque; Shoulder rotators; Strength imbalance,Dynamometers; Torque; Cricket bowler; Isokinetic dynamometers; Isokinetic strength ratio; Isokinetics; Peak torque; Predisposing factors; Shoulder injury; Shoulder rotator; Strength imbalance; Strength ratios; Muscle,"""Muscle Strength, Endurance, and Injury Risk in Upper-Extremity Sports Performance""",Muscular Strength and Injury Risk in Athletes,Injury Risk and Performance in Athletes

Percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD) is a common surgical method for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation. The difference between single-segment lumbar disc herniation and double-segment lumbar disc herniation with Sciatic Scoliosis in adults after PELD needs further study. The aim of this study was to compare the imaging features of single-segment and double-segment lumbar disc herniation with Sciatic Scoliosis in adults and to further explore the clinical outcomes of functional improvement and scoliosis imaging parameters of the two groups after PELD. Methods: Adult patients with lumbar disc herniation with sciatic scoliosis who received PELD from January 2019 to June 2022 were analyzed retrospectively. According to the number of operative segments, the patients were divided into a single-segment group and a double-segment group. Perioperative parameters were observed and compared between the two groups. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score, Oswestry dysfunction index (ODI), Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores (JOA) and imaging parameters of the two groups were recorded and compared before the operation and during the follow-up. Results: A total of 53 patients with single segments and 21 patients with double segments were included in this study. During the follow-up, the VAS score, ODI index and JOA score of the two groups were significantly improved as compared with those before the operation(P < 0. 05). Ninety-two point five percent of single-segment patients and 90.5% of double segment patients returned to normal scoliosis within 12 months after the operation. The operation time, number of intraoperative fluoroscopy times and the amount of intraoperative blood loss in single-segment patients were better than those in double-segment group(P < 0. 05). At the last follow-up, the AVT, CBD and SVA in the double-segment group were 5.2 ± 2.3, 5.1 ± 1.0 and 12.2 ± 3.0 mm, respectively, which were higher than those in the single-segment group (1.9 ± 0.4, 1.1 ± 1.6 and 3.9 ± 2.1 mm) (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: PELD is an effective treatment for single-segment and double-segment lumbar disc herniation with Sciatic scoliosis. Double-segment patients can enjoy similar clinical efficacy to single-segment patients, avoiding complications caused by decompression, fusion, and internal fixation. Scoliosis was corrected spontaneously within 12 months after operation, and the sagittal curve was significantly improved in both groups. The improvement of coronal and sagittal balance in double -segment patients may take longer. © 2024, The Author(s).",Adult lumbar disc herniation; Double segmental; Percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy; Sciatic scoliosis; Single segmental,"Adult; Diskectomy; Diskectomy, Percutaneous; Endoscopy; Humans; Intervertebral Disc Displacement; Lumbar Vertebrae; Retrospective Studies; Scoliosis; Treatment Outcome; bisoprolol fumarate; adult; article; clinical outcome; complication; controlled study; female; fluoroscopy; follow up; human; lumbar discectomy; lumbar disk hernia; major clinical study; male; operation duration; osteosynthesis; Oswestry Disability Index; retrospective study; sciatica; scoliosis; surgery; visual analog scale",Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Evaluation and Improvement of Postural Balance and Muscle Strength

There is wide variation in the clinical presentation, and because of its unique characteristics, several evaluation tools of clinical severity, behavior, and functional motor abilities have been proposed specifically for it. This opinion paper aims to present up-to date evaluation tools which have specifically been adapted for individuals with RTT often used by the authors in their clinical and research practice and to provide the reader with essential considerations and suggestions regarding their use. Due to the rarity of Rett syndrome, we found it important to present these scales in order to improve and professionalize their clinical work. The current article will review the following evaluation tools: (a) the Rett Assessment Rating Scale; (b) the Rett Syndrome Gross Motor Scale; (c) the Rett Syndrome Functional Scale; (d) the Functional Mobility Scale—Rett Syndrome; (e) the Two-Minute Walking Test modified for Rett syndrome; (f) the Rett Syndrome Hand Function Scale; (g) the StepWatch Activity Monitor; (h) the activPALTM; (i) the Modified Bouchard Activity Record; (j) the Rett Syndrome Behavioral Questionnaire; and (k) the Rett Syndrome Fear of Movement Scale.

The secondary purpose of this study was to compare these parameters in early and advanced OC survivors. Methods: Thirty-two OC survivors (n = 15 early stage; n = 17 advanced stage) with no evidence/suspicion of cancer recurrence after completing adjuvant local and systemic treatments for at least 12 months and 32 healthy controls were recruited for functional- and health-related assessments. Participants were assessed using the following methods of measuring the following: 6-min walk test (6MWT) for functional exercise capacity, 30-s chair stand test (30 s-CST) for functional fitness and muscle endurance, a handheld dynamometer for peripheral muscle strength, and a handheld dynamometer for lower extremity strength, Medical Micro RPM for respiratory muscle strength, International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF) for physical activity level, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Scale (ECOG-PS) for performance status, Checklist Individual Strength (CIS) for fatigue, Treatment/Gynecological Oncology-Neurotoxicity (FACT/GOG-NTX) for neuropathy, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) for anxiety and depression level, and the World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) for generic quality of life. Results: All OC survivors underwent surgery and chemotherapy, and only 9.4% received radiotherapy in addition to chemotherapy. The median recurrence-free period post-completion of adjuvant treatments was 24.00 (12.00–75.00) months. OC survivors had lower 6MWT (m) (p < 0.001, r = 1.50), peripheral muscle strength (p = 0.005, r = 0.72), knee extension (p < 0.001, r = 1.54), and respiratory muscle strength (maximal inspiratory pressure) (p < 0.001, r = 1.90) (maximal expiratory pressure) (p < 0.001, r = 1.68) compared to healthy controls. HADS-A (p = 0.005, r = 0.75) and CIS scores (p = 0.025, r = 0.59) were also higher in the OC survivors. Early-stage OC survivors had better 6MWT (m) than advanced-stage OC survivors (p = 0.005, r = 1.83). Peripheral muscle strength was lower in advanced-stage OC survivors (p = 0.013, r = 0.92). FACT/GOG-NTX scores were higher in early-stage OC survivors (p < 0.001, r = 1.42). No significant differences were observed between early- and advanced-stage OC survivors in other measures (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The findings suggest functional status, and health-related parameters are negatively affected in OC survivors. Additionally, higher levels of fatigue, neuropathy anxiety, and depression were reported in advanced OC survivors. © 2024, The Author(s).",Functionality; Health parameters; Ovarian cancer; Respiratory muscle strength,"Cancer Survivors; Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial; Fatigue; Female; Functional Status; Humans; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Ovarian Neoplasms; Quality of Life; Survivors; adult; anxiety; anxiety disorder; Article; breathing muscle; cancer recurrence; cancer survivor; checklist; clinical article; controlled study; depression; exercise; fatigue; female; fitness; functional status; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety; human; international physical activity questionnaire short form; maximal expiratory pressure; maximal inspiratory pressure; middle aged; muscle exercise; muscle strength; neurotoxicity; ovary cancer; physical activity; quality of life; radiotherapy; six minute walk test; systemic therapy; WHO-5 Well-Being Index; fatigue; functional status; ovary carcinoma; ovary tumor; survivor; tumor recurrence","""Physical Activity, Rehabilitation, and Health Outcomes in Medical Conditions""",Impact of Exercise and Rehabilitation on Quality of Life and Health in Patients,Exercise Programs and Physical Activity in Cancer Recovery

Vision guarantees the postural stability of patients with FAI, and visual deprivation (VD) increases their risk of injury when completing various movements. This study explored injury risk during drop landing in patients with FAI under VD through the kinetics of lower extremities. Methods: A total of 12 males with FAI participated in the study (age, 23.0 ± 0.8 years; height, 1.68 ± 0.06 m; weight, and 62.2 ± 10.4 kg) completed single-leg drop landings under visual presence (VP) and VD conditions. Ground reaction force (GRF), time to peak GRF, joint torque, and vertical length variation (ΔL) were measured. Results: Significant effects were detected in the group for time to peak lateral GRF (p = 0.004), hip extensor torque (p = 0.022), ankle plantarflexion torque (p < 0.001), ankle varus torque (p = 0.021), lower extremity stiffness (p = 0.035), and ankle stiffness (p < 0.001). Significant effects of conditions were detected for vertical GRF, time to peak vertical and lateral GRF, loading rate, hip extensor torque, knee extensor torque, hip varus torque, knee varus torque, lower extremity stiffness, and ankle stiffness (p < 0.05). ΔL was affected by VD with a significant difference (p < 0.001). Conclusion: In patients with FAI, an unstable extremity has a higher injury risk than a stable extremity, and VD increases such risk. However, because the influence of the central nervous system on hip strategy is also affected, the effect on the unstable extremity is more significant and more likely to result in injury. Deepening the squat range may be an effective preventive measure for reducing injury risk of unstable extremities during drop landing.

However, existing fall risk assessments mainly depend on scales, which are inconvenient, subjective, and imprecise. The aim of this study was to explore a machine learning model based on gait parameters to evaluate the risk of falls in older adults living in the community over a one-year period. A total of 46 elderly subjects were recruited in this study. Information on demographics, disease history, and fall history was collected via questionnaire. Moreover, this study used a gait analysis system based on inertial measurement unit and Azure Kinect to acquire the spatiotemporal parameters of the subjects' gait. Based on the above data, various machine learning models, including k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, gradient boosting decision tree, and voting classifier, were built to estimate the fall risk level of elderly individuals. K-nearest neighbor performed best among all the models with an accuracy of 0.80 on the individual test set, an F1 score of 0.67, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.83. Gait frequency was found to be the most significant feature associated with fall risk, followed by body mass index and gait cycle variability. The findings suggest that the k-nearest neighbor model can provide a quantitative and objective evaluation of fall risk for older adults living in the community and that the evaluation is more accurate when both gait parameters and disease history are taken into account. © 2013 IEEE.",Fall risk; gait analysis; machine learning; risk assessment,Adaptive boosting; Artificial intelligence; Decision trees; Gait analysis; Learning systems; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Parameter estimation; Pattern recognition; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Fall risk; Gait parameters; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Older adults; Predictive models; Risks assessments; Risks management; Spatiotemporal phenomenon; Risk management,"""Balance, Mobility, and Fall Risks in Aging and Musculoskeletal Conditions""",Impact and Control of Chronic Low Back Pain and Balance in Older Adults,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

This study introduces the technique and clinical results of a novel intramedullary support nail and plate system (ISNPs) for the internal fixation of 3- or 4- part PHF in older adults. The ISNPs combines the concept of intramedullary support and dynamic fixation into a locking plate fixation system that can be applied using a minimally invasive surgical approach. Methods: A total of 46 consecutive patients diagnosed with 3- or 4-part PHF that met the criteria were included in this study, including 18 in the ISNPs group and 28 in the conventional locking plate (LP) group. Clinical results, including operative time, intraoperative bleeding, reduction quality, subjective outcome ratings, and complications, were compared between the two groups. Functional outcomes were evaluated using the Constant score and disability of the arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH) questionnaire at 1-year follow-up. Results: There were no significant differences in age, sex, local bone quality, Neer-fracture type, and follow-up time between the ISNPs and LP groups. For clinical analysis, there were no significant differences in intraoperative bleeding and operation time between the ISNPs and LP groups. Significant differences were observed in the percentage of the malreduced cases, Constant and DASH score analysis, and the patients’ subjective evaluation (‘excellent’ and ‘good’ %) between the two groups. Conclusion: The ISNPs technique proposed in this study provides a novel hybrid internal fixation model for complex PHF with osteoporosis. The clinical results at 1-year follow-up confirmed the advantage of applying it to 3- or 4- part PHF in older patients. Further studies are required to optimize its design and explore its optimal indications. © 2022, The Author(s).",Locking plate; Nail; Osteoporosis; Proximal humeral fracture; Support,"Aged; Epiphyses; Humans; Humerus; Shoulder; Shoulder Fractures; Upper Extremity; adult; aged; Article; bone quality; clinical article; Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (score); evaluation study; female; follow up; fracture fixation; groups by age; human; male; minimally invasive surgery; operation duration; operative blood loss; proximal humerus fracture; scoring system; sex; treatment outcome; diagnostic imaging; epiphysis; humerus; shoulder; shoulder fracture; upper limb","""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Shoulder Surgery Outcomes and Measures

This condition can lead to depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem in women who experience it. Objectives: The aim of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of physical therapy interventions for the treatment of female dyspareunia. Design: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. Method: Search of publications was conducted in Scopus, Medline, Pubmed, Cinahl and Web of Science. Treatment effects were defined as standardized mean difference and their 95% confidence intervals. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using Crohan's Q test and quantified using the I2 index. Results: Of the 19 articles selected, six applied multimodal physiotherapy treatments; five, electrotherapy; three, Thiele's massage; two, interdisciplinary interventions or pelvic floor muscle training; and one, extracorporeal shockwave therapy. The meta-analysis showed significant results for the variables pain and quality of life with the interventions based on electrotherapy and electrotherapy combined with pelvic floor muscle training. These interventions did not show significant results for the improvement of sexual function. Conclusions: Physiotherapy techniques are effective and procedures have been identified with reliable results in improving pain and quality of life in patients with dyspareunia. One of the most important aspects is the strengthening of the perineal musculature and the application of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation. Furthermore, manual trigger point release therapy and Thiele massage, optimize and guarantee the reduction of pain intensity.

To study the dynamics of the function of the lower limb and gait of patients after knee replacement using physical therapy. Material & Methods. Patients were randomly distributed into groups – control (CG) and study (MG), each group – 12 people (n=24). The groups received a rehabilitation intervention according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) concept. For each person, a categorical profile was created and SMART goals were set. The developed program of physical therapy (PT) for the MG, taking into account short-term goals in a SMART format, included the use of kinesitherapy according to the author’s method, hydrokinesitherapy and physiotherapy. Lower limb function and gait were assessed before and after the intervention using the Visual Analogue Pain Scale (VAS), goniometry, Tegner-Lusholm scale and Timed Up and Go (TUG) Test. Results. VAS pain scores showed significant dynamics in both groups, but without a significant difference between the groups (p>0,05). Indicators of the amplitude of flexion in the operated knee joint approached the normative values; in patients from the MG they improved by 23,51%, and in the CG – by 10,83% (p<0,05). Improvement in indicators on the Tegner-Lusholm scale after the rehabilitation cycle occurred in both groups (p<0,05), but the results of the MG were significantly higher (p<0.05). During the repeated study, 16.66% of the CG showed an “excellent result”, in the absence of such a result in the CG. Timed Up and Go (TUG) Test indicators had positive dynamics in both groups (p<0,05), but large changes were observed in the MG (р<0,05). Conclusions. analysis of the dynamics of indicators of physical functions, range of motion and gait of persons 50-64 years old after total knee replacement confirmed the advantages of the developed physical therapy program for persons in the MG. © 2024 by the authors.",goniometry; knee replacement; physical therapy; Tegner-Lusholm scale; Timed Up and Go (TUG) Test; VAS,,"""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation in Osteoarthritis Patients

Previous studies have shown evidence of sociodemographic disparities with these injuries. The purpose of this nationwide study was to better understand these disparities based on ethnicity, sex, and socioeconomic status, in order to inform future health care strategies. Methods: Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) is a no-fault comprehensive compensation scheme encompassing all of Aotearoa/New Zealand (population in 2018, 4.7 million). Using the ACC database, traumatic rotator cuff injuries were identified between January 2010 and December 2018. Injuries were categorized by sex, ethnicity, age, and socioeconomic deprivation index of the claimant. Results: During the 9-year study period, there were 351,554 claims accepted for traumatic rotator cuff injury, which totaled more than NZ$960 million. The greatest proportion of costs was spent on vocational support (49.8%), then surgery (26.3%), rehabilitation (13.1%), radiology (8.1%), general practitioner (1.6%), and “Other” (1.1%). Asian, Māori (indigenous New Zealanders), and Pacific peoples were under-represented in the age-standardized proportion of total claims and had lower rates of surgery than Europeans. Māori had higher proportion of costs spent on vocational support and lower proportions spent on radiology, rehabilitation, and surgery than Europeans. Males had higher number and costs of claims and were more likely to have surgery than females. There were considerably fewer claims from areas of high socioeconomic deprivation. Discussion and Conclusion: This large nationwide study demonstrates the important and growing economic burden of rotator cuff injuries. Indirect costs, such as vocational supports, are a major contributor to the cost, suggesting improving treatment and rehabilitation protocols would have the greatest economic impact. This study has also identified sociodemographic disparities that need to be addressed in order to achieve equity in health outcomes. © 2022 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees",Case Series; Descriptive Epidemiology Study; epidemiology; injuries; Level IV; Rotator cuff; tendon; trauma,Female; Humans; Male; New Zealand; Rotator Cuff Injuries; Shoulder Pain; Socioeconomic Disparities in Health; Treatment Outcome; administrative claims (health care); adult; Article; Asian; ethnicity; European; female; general practice; general practitioner; groups by age; health care cost; health care disparity; human; indigenous people; major clinical study; male; Maori (people); middle aged; New Zealand; New Zealander; Pacific Islander; rehabilitation care; retrospective study; rotator cuff injury; rotator cuff repair; sex difference; shoulder radiography; social isolation; social status; vocation; epidemiology; rotator cuff injury; shoulder pain; treatment outcome,"""Shoulder Joint Health and Rehabilitation: Arthroscopic Surgeries, Treatments and Outcomes""",Clinical Outcomes and Treatments in Shoulder Care,Shoulder Surgery Outcomes and Measures

A large number of studies have emerged, most frequently using assessment criteria based on painful symptoms or joint damage. Development: While many authors argue for a threshold of 10–20 mm to establish a link between pain and LLD, most publications based on radiography show lesion stigmata on lumbar, hip and knee joints as early as 6 mm. This would be linked to comorbidities. Discussion: Some studies argue forcefully that leg-length correction below 20 mm is of no benefit. The authors of the present article, on the other hand, evoke the notion of lesion risks in the absence of correction, even for small deviations in the presence of certain associated factors and according to their importance. Conclusion: The authors argue for the need to define in the future a lesion significance score that would not be correlated to painful symptomatology, but rather to the presence of co-morbidities such as age, anatomical variability, sports practice and/or patients' professional activities. Other parameters, such as mobility, should also be taken into consideration, while gender, height and weight do not appear to be significantly related. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Chiropractic; Difference in lower limb length; Leg length discrepancies; Orthopedics; Osteopathy; Podiatry; Radiology; Sports medicine,age; anatomical variation; Article; body height; body weight; comorbidity; gender; hip joint; human; joint injury; knee joint; leg length inequality; lumbar spine; osteopathic medicine; pain; patient mobility; podiatry; radiography; sport; sports medicine; symptomatology,"""Lower Extremity Health and Biomechanics: Studies on Pain, Function, and Treatment Methods""",Lower Limb Biomechanics and Pain Management in Chronic Conditions,Hip Arthroscopy Outcomes and Rehabilitation

The purpose of this study was to determine whether MLB players who sustain metacarpal fractures demonstrate decreased performance on return to competition in comparison to the performance of control-matched peers. Methods: Data for MLB position players with metacarpal fractures incurred over 17 seasons were obtained from injury reports, press releases, and player profiles. Age, position, career experience, body mass index (BMI), injury mechanism, handedness, and treatment were recorded. Individual season statistics for the 2 seasons immediately before injury and the 2 seasons after injury were obtained. Controls matched by player position, age, BMI, career experience, and performance statistics were identified. A performance comparison of the cohorts was performed. Results: Overall, 24 players met inclusion criteria. Eleven players with metacarpal fractures were treated with surgery (46%) and 13 (54%) were treated nonoperatively. Players treated nonoperatively missed significantly fewer games following injury compared with those treated operatively (35.5 vs 52.6 games, P =.04). There was no significant difference in postinjury performance when compared with preinjury performance among the fracture cohorts. Players with metacarpal fractures treated nonoperatively had a significant decline in their Wins Above Replacement (WAR) 2 seasons postinjury (1.37 point decline) in comparison to matched controls (0.84 point increase) (P =.02). There was no significant difference in WAR 1 or 2 seasons postinjury for players with metacarpal fractures treated operatively in comparison to the control cohort. Conclusions: Major League Baseball players sustaining metacarpal fractures can expect to return to their preinjury performance levels following both nonoperative and operative treatment. However, players treated nonoperatively may witness a decline in their performance compared with peers over the long term. Orthopedic surgeons treating professional athletes with metacarpal fractures should consider these outcomes when counseling their patients and making treatment recommendations. © The Author(s) 2022.",Major League Baseball; metacarpal fracture; performance; professional athlete; return to sport,"Athletes; Baseball; Fractures, Bone; Hand Deformities; Hand Injuries; Humans; Metacarpal Bones; Return to Sport; athlete; baseball; fracture; hand injury; hand malformation; human; metacarpal bone; return to sport",Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Injury Risk and Performance in Athletes

To evaluate the effectiveness of Tuina in relieving the pain, negative emotions, and disability of patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Design. Single-center, parallel, randomized controlled trial. Setting. Shanghai Guanghua Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital, Shanghai, China. Subjects. Adult patients with KOA who were able to speak Chinese and self-report symptoms were eligible. Methods. A total of 104 patients were randomly allocated to receive the 6-week treatment of Tuina (Tuina group) or celecoxib (celecoxib group). Data on pain, negative emotions, and disability were collected at baseline, at week 2, 4, and 6, and follow-up (1 month after the last treatment). The primary outcomes were the pressure pain thresholds. The secondary outcomes were: (1) numerical rating scale at rest and with movement; (2) Hamilton Anxiety Scale; (3) Hamilton Depression Scale; (4) Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index; and (5) clinical effective rate. The adverse events of the trial were evaluated. Results. In total, 99 patients completed the follow-up. Generalized linear mixed models were constructed to analyse the between-group differences. Statistically significant differences were found in the interaction effects (P < .05). In evaluating the group effect, statistical differences were found at week 6 and follow-up (P < .05). Further, all variables showed a time effect (P < .05). A statistical difference in the clinical effective rate was found between the Tuina and celecoxib groups (P < .05). Conclusions.

This study aimed to investigate whether TCC players have different limb and joint strengths in the upper and lower limbs from non-Tai Chi Chuan (NTCC). Methods: Twenty TCC players who have at least one year of experience playing TCC were compared with a group of 25 NTCC participants. A force sensor was used to measure forces in the lower and upper limbs. Maximum forces produced by the lower limbs was measured during a standing position with straight legs or were measured in a seated position. The maximum forces produced by the upper limbs were measured in a standing position at elbow and shoulder levels. Results: The forces of the knee extensors in the TCC group were significantly higher (7.4%) than in the NTCC group; however, the forces of the knee flexors in the TCC group were significantly lower than the NTCC group. The heel-force in hip extension in the NTCC group was significantly higher (9.3%) than in TCC; the toe-force in the plantar flexion in the NTCC was significantly higher than in the TCC group. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the hand-forces in the upper limbs. Conclusions: TCC routine movements strengthen the muscles related to knee extension, which are mainly related to bending knee performance during TCC exercise. For the healthy people between 42 and 78 years old, TCC benefits the enhancement of the strength for knee extension but not for the knee flexion, ankle plantar flexion and hip extension. There is no significant difference between the TCC and NTCC groups on the strength of upper limbs and joints. As a whole, the effect of Tai Chi Chuan exercise on the strengths in the limbs and joints is compromised. In the future, a study with larger sample size than this study is highly recommended. © 2023 by the authors.",force sensor; joint strength; lower limbs; Tai Chi Chuan; upper limb,,"""Analysis of Biomechanics, Exercise Techniques, and Physiological Adaptations in Various Physical Activities""",Lower Limb Muscle Strength and Biomechanics Studies,Muscle Strength and Recovery in Sports Performance

Despite commonly cited criteria for PPCSs involving 3 or more complaints, many individuals experience just 1 or 2 symptoms that may still negatively affect HRQoL. Objective: To determine differences in HRQoL between children and adolescents with 0, 1 to 2, or 3 parent-reported persistent symptoms at 1 month postconcussion. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Community practice clinics. Patients or Other Participants: Individuals aged 8 to 18 years presented for the initial visit within 3 days of a sport- or recreation-related concussion. One month later, parents or guardians reported persistent symptoms using the Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ). Individuals with complete symptom data were analyzed (n = 236/245, n = 97 females, age = 14.3 6 2.1 years). Participants were grouped by the number of discrete RPQ symptoms reported as worse than preinjury (0, 1-2, or 3 ). Main Outcome Measure(s): Total summary and subscale scores on the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 23-item HRQoL inventory and 18-item Multidimensional Fatigue Scale (MDFS). Results: Kruskal-Wallis rank sum tests highlighted differences in PedsQL HRQoL and MDFS total scores across symptom groups (PedsQL HRQoL: v2 2 = 85.53, P , .001; MDFS: v2 2 = 93.15, P , .001). Dunn post hoc analyses indicated all 3 groups were statistically significantly different from each other (P , .001). The median (interquartile range) values for the Peds QL Inventory HRQoL totals were 93.5 (84.2-98.8) for those with 0 symptoms; 84.8 (73.9-92.4) for those with 1 to 2 symptoms; and 70.7 (58.7-78.0) for those with 3 symptoms. The median (interquartile range) values for the MDFS totals were 92.4 (76.4-98.6) for those with 0 symptoms; 78.5 (65.6-88.9) for those with 1 to 2 symptoms; and 54.2 (46.2-65.3) for those with 3 symptoms. Similar group differences were observed for each PedsQL HRQoL and MDFS subscale score. Conclusions: Children and adolescents whose parents reported 1 to 2 PPCSs had lower HRQoL and more fatigue than those with 0 symptoms. Across all 3 groups, those with 3 persistent symptoms had the lowest HRQoL and most fatigue. These findings indicate the continued need for intervention in this age group to prevent and address PPCSs. © 2023 National Athletic Trainers' Association Inc..

This pilot study aims to investigate if the immediate experience of musculoskeletal pain during gait influences kinematics and selective-motor-control in individuals with spastic cerebral-palsy. Methods: Retrospective treadmill-based gait-analysis data for 145 individuals with spastic cerebral-palsy were screened. Participants were asked about experiencing lower-extremity musculoskeletal pain immediately during gait, with 26 individuals (18%) reporting this was the case (pain-group; mean 11.55 ± 3.15 years, Gross-Motor-Function-Classification-System levels I/II/III n = 5/13/8, Uni/bilateral involvement n = 11/15). Of the 77 individuals who did not report any pain, a no-pain group (n = 26) was individually matched. Kinematics were evaluated using the Gait-Profile-Score and spatiotemporal parameters (dimensionless-walking-speed, single-leg-support percentage and step-time). Selective-motor-control was assessed using the Walking-Dynamic-Motor-Control index. Findings: In the pain-group, 58% reported experiencing pain in their more-involved leg, 8% in the less-involved leg and 34% in both legs. Regarding the pain location, 38% of the pain-group reported experiencing pain in multiple locations. On a more specific level, 35%, 46% and 54% reported pain around the hip/thigh, knee/calf and ankle/ft, respectively. No significant differences were observed between the pain and no-pain groups for any of the outcome measures, in each leg or bilaterally. Interpretation: No significant differences in kinematics and selective-motor-control during gait were found between individuals with spastic cerebral-palsy, with and without musculoskeletal pain. This suggests that the individuals in this study may not present with obvious antalgic gait patterns, which may relate to the pre-existing altered kinematics and selective-motor-control. © 2023",Cerebral palsy; Gait; Kinematics; Muscle synergy analysis; Pain,Biomechanical Phenomena; Cerebral Palsy; Gait; Humans; Muscle Spasticity; Musculoskeletal Pain; Paralysis; Pilot Projects; Retrospective Studies; Diseases; Gait analysis; Cerebral palsy; Gait; Lower extremity; Motor control; Motor function; Muscle synergies; Muscle synergy analyse; Musculoskeletal pains; Pain; Pilot studies; antalgic gait; Article; cerebral palsy; child; cohort analysis; controlled study; dorsal rhizotomy; female; gait; Gross Motor Function Classification System; human; kinematics; major clinical study; male; medical history; motor control; musculoskeletal pain; physical examination; pilot study; school child; walking speed; biomechanics; cerebral palsy; complication; gait; paralysis; retrospective study; spasticity; Kinematics,"""Pain Management and Musculoskeletal Health in Various Populations""",Chronic Pain Management and Treatment Studies,Wearable Devices and Techniques in Gait Analysis and Mobility Rehabilitation

Materials and methods. 38 students with disabilities, aged 18-23, who entered the first year of study at the university, voluntarily participated in the study. The studied sample consisted of students with a simple form of disorder in the musculoskeletal system, who have the ability to move independently and perform motor actions. An information search approach to data collection was used at the theoretical level, and pedagogical testing and methods of mathematical statistics were used at the empirical level. Results. A method for assessing the strength endurance of the core muscles developed on the basis of information technologies is presented. To implement the method, a network of sensors formed by analog and digital sensors, wireless infrared communication devices, information from which enters the programmable logic controller and is fed to the personal computer, is used. The software has been developed that implements immediate processing and presentation of test control results in real-time. Correlation analysis was used to calculate the indicators of test reliability and validity of fixing the results of tests using the method presented in this paper and the traditional method. Conclusions. Experimental verification of the presented method for controlling the development of the core muscles of students with disabilities has proven its practical effectiveness. In conclusion, the numerical values of reliability and validity obtained using the automated method of countering are within the range of “above average,” in contrast to the measurements made by the traditional method of control using a test exercise: the calculation of test reliability and validity revealed a level of “below average.” The set of obtained numerical characteristics of empirical data proved the advantage of using the latest information technologies in inclusive physical education as a factor of its effectiveness. Achieving positive results in ensuring the proper level of health, full physical and psychological rehabilitation of higher education students with disabilities is considered as a practical value of implementing inclusion in a higher education institution. © Blavt, O., Iedynak, G., Pereverzieva, S., Holub, V., & Melnyk, S., 2023.",control; inclusion; information technologies; physical education; students; testing,,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Management and Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

This study assesses the test-retest reliability of isokinetic leg function in the knee flexors and extensors at 150°/s in children and young adults with severe burns to be used for rehabilitation exercise program prescription. In 39 severely burned patients (49 ± 14% total body surface area burn [TBSA], mean ± SD; 34 ± 21% TBSA 3rd degree; 14 ± 5 years, 153.3 ± 16.5 cm height; 53.8 ± 17.9 kg) knee flexion/extension isokinetic dynamometry at 150°/s was performed on each patient's dominant leg in two sessions. The patient was acquainted with the test and performed 1 set of 10 repetitions at 150°/s. A second session of 1 set of 10 repetitions at 150°/ was performed within 24 h of the first. Muscle function outcomes were knee flexion/extension peak torque, average peak torque, and average power. One-sample paired t tests were performed for all muscle function outcomes; intraclass correlation coefficients and r2 values with session two as a function of session one were calculated. Sessions did not differ significantly in knee extension or flexion for any muscle function outcome or the hamstrings to quadriceps ratio. All intraclass correlation coefficients were >0.89 and r2 > 0.79.

Despite great progress in detection and treatment, life reconstruction requires comprehensive cross-sectoral approaches between different disciplines and deeper consideration of the patient’s challenges. Hippotherapy is an emerging specialized rehabilitation approach, performed by accredited health professionals and equine specialists, on specially trained horses via their movement, activating major paths for physical, mental, psychic and social reinforcement, and is synergistic to rehabilitative and supportive care. Methods: We conducted a randomized open, prospective, two-armed, controlled trial on the effectiveness of hippotherapy versus conventional supportive care on adult women with a diagnosis of breast cancer, after the period of primary treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy). The 6-month program included, in the treated group, an initial 1-week daily hippotherapy session, followed by three short 2-day sessions with an interval of 2 months between each, where the patients received conventional supportive care. The control group received 6 months of conventional supportive care. The primary end point was quality of life. Cognitive performances, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and body image were the secondary end points. Measurements were done through self-reported questionnaires. Results: We observed statistical differences in the evolution of the measured parameters over time between the two groups. The hippotherapy group showed a much faster, favorable and continuous improvement until the end of the program for each function assessed. The most striking improvements were observed in global quality of life, and fatigue, while breast cancer-specific quality of life, cognitive performance, anxiety and depression and body image showed a less marked but still statistically significant difference at the final post-treatment evaluation. Conclusions: We demonstrate the therapeutic relevance of hippotherapy, a one-health approach, as a key initial stage after cancer diagnosis and treatment to foster recovery. Furthermore, hippotherapy has a strong impact on cancer treatments’ efficiency and reconstruction of patient’s life and ecosystem.

Methods: A search was performed on PubMed, Embase®, and Cochrane. Studies that compared the diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests or ultrasound versus arthroscopy for the assessment of LHBT pathologies were included. Results: Seven studies were included reporting on a total of 448 patients. One study on instability using ultrasound reported sensitivity and specificity of 1.00 and 0.96, respectively. Two studies on full-thickness tears using ultrasound reported sensitivity and specificity of 0.88–0.95 and 0.71–0.98, respectively. Four studies on partial-thickness LHBT tears reported sensitivity and specificity of 0.17–0.68 and 0.38–0.92, respectively, for clinical tests, versus 0.27–0.71 and 0.71–1.00, respectively, for ultrasound. Three studies on other LHBT pathologies reported sensitivity and specificity of 0.18–0.79 and 0.53–0.85, respectively, for clinical tests, versus 0.50 and 1.00, respectively, for ultrasound. Conclusion: To detect LHBT pathologies, sensitivity is high-to-excellent using ultrasound, and moderate using Neer’s sign and Speed’s test, while specificity is high-to-excellent also using ultrasound, as well as the belly press, lift-off and Kibler’s tests. The clinical relevance of these findings is that clinical tests are only reliable either to confirm or rule out LHBT pathologies, whereas ultrasound is reliable both to confirm and rule out LHBT pathologies. While diagnostic imaging cannot substitute for patient history and physical examination, the reliability and accessibility of ultrasound render it practical for routine use, particularly if clinical tests render unclear or contradictory findings.

These tools were cheaper than other thermographic devices used to measure superficial human muscle tissue temperature. In addition, infrared thermography has been previously used to assess skin temperature related to muscle tissue conditions in the triceps surae of athletes. Nevertheless, the reliability and repeatability of an infrared thermography device designed for materials, such as the Manual Infrared Camera PCE-TC 30, have yet to be determined to measure skin temperature of the triceps surae muscle tissue of athletes. Objective: The purpose was to determine the procedure’s intra- and inter-session reliability and repeatability to determine skin temperature within the Manual Infrared Camera PCE-TC 30 thermography device in the triceps surae muscle tissue of athletes, which was initially designed to measure the superficial temperature of materials. Methods: A total of 34 triceps surae muscles were bilaterally assessed from 17 healthy athletes using the Manual Infrared Camera PCE-TC 30 thermography device to determine intra- (at the same day separated by 1 h) and inter-session (at alternate days separated by 48 h) reliability and repeatability of the skin temperature of the soleus, medial and lateral gastrocnemius muscles. The triceps surae complex weas measured by a region of interest of 1 cm2 through five infrared thermography images for each muscle. Statistical analyses comprised intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), standard error of measurement (SEM), minimum detectable change (MCD), systematic error of measurement, correlation (r), and Bland-Altman plots completed with linear regression models (R2). Results: Intra- and inter-session measurements of the proposed infrared thermography procedure showed excellent reliability (ICC(1,2) = 0.968–0.977), measurement errors (SEM = 0.186–0.232 ℃; MDC = 0.515–0.643 ℃), correlations (r = 0.885–0.953), and did not present significant systematic error of measurements (P > 0.05). Adequate agreement between each pair of measurement moments was presented by the Bland-Altman plots according to the limits of agreement and non-significant linear regression models (R2 = 0.000–0.019; P > 0.05). Conclusions: The proposed procedure to determine skin temperature within the Manual Infrared Camera PCE-TC 30 thermography device presented excellent intra- and inter-session reliability and repeatability in athletes’ triceps surae muscle tissue. Future studies should consider the SEM and MDC of this procedure to measure the skin temperature of soleus, medial, and lateral gastrocnemius muscles to promote triceps surae muscle prevention and recovery in athletes.

Study design and setting CPGs for HP infection were systematically collected from PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and six online guideline repositories. Three researchers independently used the AGREE II tool to evaluate the methodological quality of the eligible CPGs. In addition, the reporting and recommendation qualities were appraised by using the RIGHT and AGREE-REX tools, respectively. The distribution of the level of evidence and strength of recommendation among evidence-based CPGs was determined. Results A total of 7,019 records were identified, and 24 CPGs met the eligibility criteria. Of the eligible CPGs, 19 were evidence-based and 5 were consensus-based. The mean overall rating score of AGREE II was 50.7% (SD = 17.2%). Among six domains, the highest mean score was for scope and purpose (74.4%, SD = 17.7%) and the lowest mean score was for applicability (24.3%, SD = 8.9). Only three of 24 CPGs were high-quality. The mean overall score of recommendation quality was 35.5% (SD = 12.2%), and the mean scores in each domain of AGREE-REX and RIGHT were all ≤ 60%, with values and preferences scoring the lowest (16.6%, SD = 11.9%). A total of 505 recommendations were identified. Strong recommendations accounted for 64.1%, and only 34.3% of strong recommendations were based on high-quality evidence. Conclusion The overall quality of CPGs for HP infection is poor, and CPG developers tend to neglect some domains, resulting in a wide variability in the quality of the CPGs. Additionally, CPGs for HP infection lack sufficient high-quality evidence, and the grading of recommendation strength should be based on the quality of evidence. The CPGs for HP infection have much room for improvement and further researches are required to minimize the evidence gap.  © 2024 Ou et al.

The temporary muscle soreness associated with high intensity eccentric contractions may explain their limited use in clinical exercise prescription, however any discomfort is often alleviated after the initial bout (repeated bout effect). Therefore, the aims of the present study were to examine the acute and repeated bout effects of eccentric contractions on neuromuscular factors associated with the risk of falling in older adults. Methods: Balance, functional ability [timed up-and-go and sit-to-stand], and lower-limb maximal and explosive strength were measured in 13 participants (67.6 ± 4.9 year) pre- and post-eccentric exercise (0, 24, 48, and 72 hr) in Bout 1 and 14 days later in Bout 2. The eccentric exercise intervention was performed on an isokinetic unilateral stepper ergometer at 50% of maximal eccentric strength at 18 step‧min−1 per limb for 7 min (126 steps per limb). Two-way repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted to identify any significant effects (P ≤ 0.05). Results: Eccentric strength significantly decreased (− 13%) in Bout 1 at 24 hr post-exercise; no significant reduction was observed at any other time-point after Bout 1. No significant reductions occurred in static balance or functional ability at any time-point in either bout. Conclusion: Submaximal multi-joint eccentric exercise results in minimal disruption to neuromuscular function associated with falls in older adults after the initial bout. © 2023, Crown.",Ageing; Delayed onset muscle soreness; Eccentric contractions; Strength,"Aged; Exercise; Exercise Therapy; Humans; Muscle Contraction; Muscle, Skeletal; Myalgia; aged; exercise; human; kinesiotherapy; muscle contraction; myalgia; physiology; skeletal muscle","""Balance, Mobility, and Fall Risks in Aging and Musculoskeletal Conditions""",Impact and Control of Chronic Low Back Pain and Balance in Older Adults,Muscle Strength and Recovery in Sports Performance

However, an uninvestigated “window of opportunity” exists for exercise therapy early in the disease. Objective: This study presents secondary analyses from the Early Multiple Sclerosis Exercise Study, and aims to investigate the efficacy of exercise on physical function, cognition, and patient-reported measures of disease and fatigue impact early in the disease course of MS. Methods: This randomized controlled trial (n = 84, time since diagnosis <2 years) included 48 weeks of aerobic exercise or an active control condition (health education) and between-group changes are based on repeated measurement mixed regression models. Physical function tests included measures of aerobic fitness, walking (6-minute walk, Timed 25-foot walk, Six-spot step test), and upper-limb dexterity. Tests of processing speed and memory evaluated cognition. The questionnaires Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale assessed perception of disease and fatigue impact. Results: Following early exercise aerobic fitness showed superior between-group physiological adaptations (4.0 [1.7; 6.3] ml O2/min/kg; large effect size [ES = 0.90]). No other outcomes showed significant between-group differences, yet all measures of walking and upper-limb function showed small-to-medium effect sizes in favor of exercise (ES = 0.19−0.58). Overall disability status as well as cognition were unaffected by exercise, whereas perception of disease and fatigue impact were reduced in both groups. Conclusion: In early MS, 48 weeks of supervised aerobic exercise seem to positively modify physical function, but not cognitive function. Perception of disease and fatigue impact may be modifiable by exercise in early MS.

This lack of identity development beyond athletics has the potential to lead to the development of a high AI. High AI in athletes can have positive effects in areas such as performance, however, high AI may also pose negative consequences. The development of such an identity can limit the adaptive responses to substantial life changes such as retirement from sport. This inability to adapt may thereby contribute to mental health problems during the transition. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to better understand the relationship between athletic identity and mental health symptoms so clinicians may provide support to enable positive outcomes after retirement from sport. Clinical Question: What is the influence of athletic identity on mental health symptoms in athletes retiring from sports? Summary of Key Findings: (1) High athletic identity contributes to increased mental health symptoms following retirement. (2) Athletic identity had no relationship to mental health symptoms during the preretirement phase of an athlete’s career Clinical Bottom Line: The findings suggest that there is high-quality evidence to support that AI has no relationship with mental health symptoms during the preretirement phase and that athletes with high AI are more likely to experience mental health symptoms during their transition out of or retirement from sport. Strength of Recommendation: The grade of B is recommended by the Strength of Recommendation taxonomy for consistent, limited-quality, patient-oriented evidence that high AI has a strong relationship to mental health symptoms following retirement in athletes. © 2023 Human Kinetics, Inc.",anxiety; athletes; depression; transition out of sport,Athletes; Athletic Injuries; Humans; Mental Health; Retirement; Sports; athlete; human; mental health; psychology; retirement; sport; sport injury,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Our objectives were to: 1) Establish prevalence of cachexia in a cohort of cancer patients receiving inpatient rehabilitation and its association with demographic and oncological history. 2) Determine the relationship between the presence of cachexia and functional recovery and whether these patients in inpatient rehabilitation have a distinct prognosis. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study of 250 patients over 330 admissions to an inpatient rehabilitation facility. Body weight loss threshold and Weight Loss Grading Scale identified patients with and without cachexia. Main outcomes were functional independence measure scores, discharge destination, and 6-mo survival. Results Prevalence of cachexia in inpatient rehabilitation was 59% using consensus body weight loss criteria, and 77% of cancer patients had a Weight Loss Grading Scale score greater than 0. Patients with and without cachexia had similar motor and cognitive gains, although patients with severe cachexia had more limited functional gains (P < 0.05) and increased odds of acute care return (P < 0.01). Patients with a Weight Loss Grading Scale score of 4 had decreased survival at 6 mos (P < 0.05) compared with noncachectic patients. Conclusions These data suggest that there is a relationship between cachexia and recovery for cancer patients that should be further studied in rehabilitation settings.  © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the associated factors with meniscal injury and irreparable meniscal tear and the timeline for medial meniscal injury at ACL-R in young patients. Methods: A retrospective analysis of young patients (13 to 29 years of age) who underwent ACL-R by a single surgeon from 2005 to 2017 was conducted. Predictor variables (age, sex,body mass index [BMI], time from injury to surgery [TS], and pre-injury Tegner activity level) for meniscal injury and irreparable meniscal tear were analyzed with multivariate logistic Results: Four hundred and seventy-three consecutive patients with an average of 31.2 months post-operative follow-up were enrolled in this study. The risk factors for medial meniscus injury were TS (<= 3 months) (odds ratio [OR], 3.915; 95% CI, 2.630-5.827; P < .0001) and higher BMI (OR, 1.062; 95% CI, 1.002-1.125; P = 0.0439). The presence of irreparable medial meniscal tears correlated with higher BMI (OR, 1.104; 95% CI, 1.011-1.205; P = 0.0281) Conclusion: An increased time from ACL tear to surgery of 3 months was strongly associated with an increased risk of medial meniscus injury, but not related to irreparable medial meniscal tear at primary ACL reconstruction in young patients.

Creative dance can be an innovative approach as effective as traditional exercise training. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate effect of creative dance-based exercise (CDE) training on functional capacity, postural stability and balance, pulmonary and cognitive functions, respiratory and peripheral muscle strength in COPD patients. Methods: Twenty-four patients with COPD were randomly allocated to either “chest physiotherapy and home-based walking program” (PT) or “CDE alongside home-based chest physiotherapy group” (PT+CDE). Both groups performed chest PT program twice a day for 5 days per week for 8 weeks. PT+CDE group received CDE training 2 days a week for 8 weeks. Primary outcome was six minute walk test (6MWT). Secondary outcomes were postural stability and balance, pulmonary function, maximum inspiratory (MIP) and expiratory (MEP) pressure, peripheral muscle strength, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), COPD Assessment Test (CAT), and BODE index. Outcome measures were assessed at baseline and after 8 weeks of training. Results: Both groups showed statistically significant improvements in 6MWT distance, MIP, MEP, MoCA score, CAT, and BODE index (p < 0.05). Only with CDE training was achieved improvements in postural stability and balance scores, pulmonary function, and peripheral muscle strength (p < 0.05). The improvements in 6 MWT distance, MEP, MoCA score, and CAT were greater in PT+CDE group (p < 0.05).

Predicting the adverse effects of tissue damage on the performance of other limbs is very important in the prevention of progressive damage. Finite element (FE) and musculoskeletal modeling can be helpful by allowing such effects to be studied in a way where the internal stresses in the tissue could be investigated. Hence, this study aims to investigate the effects of the hammer toe deformity on the lower extremity, especially on the plantar fascia functions. To compare the joint reactions of the hammer toe foot (HTF) and healthy foot (HF), two musculoskeletal models (MSM) of the feet of a healthy individual and that of a participant with hammer toe foot were developed based on gait analysis. A previously validated 3D finite element model which was constructed using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the diabetic participant with the hammer toe deformity was processed at five different events during the stance phase of gait. It was found that the hammer toe deformity makes dorsiflexion of the toes and the windlass mechanism less effective during walking. Specifically, the FE analysis results showed that plantar fascia (PF) in HTF compared to HF played a less dominant role in load bearing with both medial and lateral parts of PF loaded. Also, the results indicated that the stored elastic energy in PF was less in HTF than the HF, which can indicate a higher metabolic cost during walking. Internal stress distribution shows that the majority of ground reaction forces are transmitted through the lateral metatarsals in hammer toe foot, and the probability of fifth metatarsal fracture and also progressive deformity was subsequently increased. The MSM results showed that the joint reaction forces and moments in the hammer toe foot have deviated from normal, where the metatarsophalangeal joint reactions in the hammer toe were less than the values in the healthy foot. This can indicate a vicious cycle of foot deformity, leading to changes in body weight force transmission line, and deviation of joint reactions and plantar fascia function from normal. These in turn lead to increased internal stress concentration, which in trun lead to further foot deformities. This vicious cycle cause progressive damage and can lead to an increase in the risk of ulceration in the diabetic foot. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Diabetic foot ulcer; Finite element analysis; Hammer toe; Plantar fascia; Plantar soft tissue,Biomechanical Phenomena; Diabetic Foot; Fascia; Foot; Hammer Toe Syndrome; Humans; Metatarsal Bones; Diseases; Ductile fracture; Hammers; Joints (anatomy); Magnetic resonance imaging; Stress concentration; Tissue; Condition; Diabetic foot ulcer; Finite element analyse; Hammer toe; Lower extremity; Musculoskeletal modeling; Plantar fascia; Plantar soft tissue; Progressive damage; Soft tissue; adult; Article; biomechanics; body weight change; case report; clinical article; controlled study; diabetic foot; fascia; finite element analysis; foot malformation; gait; ground reaction force; hammertoe; human; lower limb; male; metatarsophalangeal joint; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; soft tissue; software; standing; tension; three dimensional finite element analysis; walking; weight bearing; biomechanics; complication; diabetic foot; diagnostic imaging; fascia; foot; metatarsal bone; Finite element method,"""Lower Extremity Health and Biomechanics: Studies on Pain, Function, and Treatment Methods""",Lower Limb Biomechanics and Pain Management in Chronic Conditions,Gender Differences in Musculoskeletal Health & Physical Fitness

Agreement of at least 67% was required for consensus to be deemed achieved on outcomes. Agreement was reached on the key components of an IPEP and potential layouts of the programme. Requirements for an activity/exercise to be deemed games-based and key outcome measures for a games-based IPEP for PE class were established. Finally, PE teacher supports and resources required for implementing a games-based IPEP in PE class were determined, including supports for PE teachers and IPEP location within the class. The recommendations of this study provide a fundamental framework for the development of future games-based IPEPs that could be applied internationally as it provides the flexibility to be adapted to suit various constraints of PE classes across the globe. © The Author(s) 2023.",games-based; injury prevention; Physical education; secondary school,,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Methods: Seven matched pairs of fresh-frozen cadaver arms were dissected to expose the humerus and elbow while preserving the biceps brachii, elbow joint capsule, and distal radioulnar soft tissue complex. For each pair, the distal biceps tendon was severed with a scalpel and then repaired with bone tunnels placed at either the anterior (anatomic) or the posterior (nonanatomic) aspect of the bicipital tuberosity on the proximal radius. A supination test with 90° of elbow flexion and an unconstrained flexion test were conducted on a customized loading frame. The biceps tension was applied incrementally at 200 g per step, whereas the radius rotation was tracked with a 3-dimensional motion analysis system. The tendon force needed to produce a degree of supination or flexion was derived as the regression slope of the tendon force-radial rotation plots. A two-tailed paired t test was performed to compare the difference between the anatomic repair and the nonanatomic repair cadavers. Results: Significantly greater tendon force was required to initiate the first 10° of supination with the elbow in flexion for the nonanatomic group compared with the anatomic group (1.04 ± 0.44 N/degree vs 0.68 ± 0.17 N/degree, P = .02). The average nonanatomic to anatomic ratio was 149% ± 38%. No difference existed between the two groups in the mean tendon force needed to produce the degree of flexion. Conclusions: Our results show that anatomic repair is more efficient in producing supination than nonanatomic repair, but only when the elbow is in 90° of flexion. When the elbow joint is not constrained, the nonanatomic supination efficiency improved, and the difference between the techniques was not significant. Clinical relevance: The present study added to the body of evidence in comparing anatomic versus nonanatomic repair of the distal biceps tendon and serves as a foundation for future biomechanical and clinical studies in this topic. Given no difference when the elbow joint was not constrained, one could argue that surgeon comfort and preference could guide which technique to use when addressing the distal biceps tendon tears. More studies will be needed to clearly define whether there will be a clinical difference between the two techniques. © 2023",Biceps tendon; Biomechanics; Flexion; Supination,aged; anatomical concepts; Article; biceps brachii muscle; biceps tendon; biomechanics; cadaver; clinical significance; comparative study; controlled study; elbow; elbow flexion; female; human; humerus; intermethod comparison; loading test; male; proximal radius; rotation; Student t test; supination; surgeon; surgical technique; tendon; tendon reconstruction; tension,"""Achilles Tendinopathy and Musculoskeletal Ultrasound Studies in Sport Medicine""",Achilles Tendon Health & Rehabilitation Research,Shoulder Pathologies and Treatment Techniques

A novel technique pointing at perineural regions using 5%-concentrated dextrose is also gaining popularity in daily clinical practice. Animal and human studies have revealed the clinical and functional benefits of perineural prolotherapy; however, the cytological effects of dextrose solution are immature. This study compared the effects of dextrose solutions at different concentrations on neurons at the cytological level. Methods: Cultures of human neuroblastoma cell lines that simulate neurons at the cytological level were prepared. The sample cultures consisted of the control group (CG), 5% dextrose-supplemented group (5DG), and 15% dextrose-supplemented group (15DG). The neuronal viability assay of the cultures before and 6 h after supplementation was compared between the groups. Results: The pre-supplementation cell viability percentage of CG was presumed to be 100%. The post-supplementation cell viability percentages of CG, 5DG, and 15DG were 93.33%, 22.22%, and 0%, respectively. The decreases in cell viability in both dextrose groups were statistically significant when compared with CG (p<0.001). Moreover, the difference in cell viability between the 5DG and 15DG groups was also statistically significant (p<0.001). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that dextrose solution has an acute, concentration-dependent toxic effect on cultured human neuroblastoma cells. © 2023 The Author.

Participants (20 first league of Tunisian football players) performed four warm-up protocols on two times a day in the morning: 09:00–10:00 and in the evening: 16:00–17:00, with at least 2 days between test sessions. All groups followed the warm-up randomly at two different periods of the day on non-consecutive days. The four protocols included: Dynamic stretching (DS), Dynamic stretching + conditioning activity (DS + High-Intensity Sprints HSJ), Dynamic stretching + drop jump (DS + DJ), and control (CONT). The thirty-meter sprint performance after different stretching and potentiation-based warm-up protocols was recorded. Two-way Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) analysis was applied to examine the difference between warm-up protocols, the difference between the time of day and the interaction effect. The major finding revealed that 30 m sprint results and the exercise-induced temperature significantly differed from morning and evening stretching and potentiation-based warm-up protocols (statistically significant p < 0.05, and evening measurements were higher compared to the morning). In conclusion, and from a practical point of view, if the objective is to increase performance over a shorter period of time, each of these warm-up protocols can be useful. For the best improvement, DS + HSJ may be preferable both in the morning and the evening. © 2023 The Author(s).",Chronobiology; Football; Physical activity; Post-activation potentiation; Time of day,adult; anthropometry; Article; athletic performance; chronobiology; circadian rhythm; conditioning; controlled study; elite athlete; football player; human; jumping; male; normal human; running; sprint interval training; squatting (exercise); stretching exercise; temperature; Tunisian; warm up; young adult,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

They result in both physical and psychological trauma, where fear of falling is a major consequence that leads to a vicious cycle that makes elderlies more isolated and dependent, making them more vulnerable to falls. Falls are multifactorial, where dizziness is a common factor in elderlies. Thus, a multi-systemic approach is essential for the assessment of balance functions; it also serves as a guide for treatment planning, either in the presence of a cause-specific pathology or when presbyvestibulopathy is the sole issue. Vestibular rehabilitation is useful in training elderlies to improve their dizziness and balance functions. Aim: The aim of the study is to assess fall risk in elderly participants and to assess the role of customized vestibular rehabilitation in decreasing dizziness and falls in elderlies identified to be at risk of falling. Results: All elderlies diagnosed at fall risk showed statistically significant improvement in dizziness handicap inventory, dynamic gait index, and computerized dynamic posturography after vestibular rehabilitation. As for dizziness, handicap inventory participants showed statistically significant improvement in the total score and in each of its three aspects (functional, emotional, and physical) after vestibular rehabilitation. The Dynamic Gait Index showed statistically significant improvement after vestibular rehabilitation, where they all became non-fallers. Subjects improved significantly in sensory organization test, limits of stability, vestibular stimulation test, motor control test, and faller assessment test of computerized dynamic posturography. Performance on the subjective assessment test was not significantly correlated to the objective assessment methods. The Dynamic Gait Index is sensitive in the detection of elderlies at risk of falling. Conclusions: Falls in elderlies is an important subject that must be taken seriously due to its major consequences. Full balance assessment is crucial for offering customized vestibular rehabilitation, which has proved to be useful in minimizing dizziness and fall risk in elderlies. © 2022, The Author(s).",Computerized dynamic posturography; Dizziness handicap inventory; Dynamic gait index; Fall; Vestibular rehabilitation,aged; Article; clinical article; controlled study; dizziness; dizziness handicap inventory; Dynamic Gait Index; fall risk; fall risk assessment; falling; female; high risk population; human; male; motor control; rehabilitation; therapy effect; treatment outcome; vestibular rehabilitation; vestibular stimulation,"""Balance, Mobility, and Fall Risks in Aging and Musculoskeletal Conditions""",Impact and Control of Chronic Low Back Pain and Balance in Older Adults,Fall Prevention and Balance Improvement in the Elderly

Thus, it is not difficult to recommend physical training programs as part of an integrated and holistic treatment approach for mental health disorders. However, getting patients to participate and keeping them engaged is a major challenge. Programs based on martial arts training could be interventions improving physical and mental health with higher attachment rates. The structured discipline, holistic approach integrating physical and mental elements, and empowering activities, may explain higher participant attachment rates. Methods: Thus, the main objective of this feasibility study is to describe a newly established group therapy program incorporating interventions from martial arts training with its physical and philosophical parts including mindfulness and breath work. Results: During the 14-month study period from April 2021 to May 2022, a Budo group therapy was used by 215 individual persons with a total of 725 group therapy participations. Retention in the program was good across all settings and very good for persons who participated as outpatients. The mean age of the participants was 33.5 years with a range from 14 to 69 years of age, and about 41% of the participants were female. The therapy program was able to address patients over the whole spectrum of psychiatric diagnoses. Satisfaction and motivation were uniformly self-reported as very good. Patients self-reported improved mental and physical health after participating in a Budo session compared to pre-session. Discussion: Budo group therapy thus can be seen as a feasible, well-accepted and promising new transdiagnostic treatment approach, combining physical activation with resilience enhancement. With minimal contraindications, a broad spectrum of individuals seeking mental health support can engage in this group therapy.

Acute respiratory complications that require intensive care unit (ICU) management are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Among other important risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes, obesity has emerged along with undernutrition-malnutrition as a strong predictor of disease risk and severity. Obesity-related excessive body fat may lead to respiratory, metabolic and immune derangements potentially favoring the onset of COVID-19 complications. In addition, patients with obesity may be at risk for loss of skeletal muscle mass, reflecting a state of hidden malnutrition with a strong negative health impact in all clinical settings. Also importantly, obesity is commonly associated with micronutrient deficiencies that directly influence immune function and infection risk. Finally, the pandemic-related lockdown, deleterious lifestyle changes and other numerous psychosocial consequences may worsen eating behaviors, sedentarity, body weight regulation, ultimately leading to further increments of obesity-associated metabolic complications with loss of skeletal muscle mass and higher non-communicable disease risk. Therefore, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies should be routinely included in the management of COVID-19 patients in the presence of obesity; lockdown-induced health risks should also be specifically monitored and prevented in this population.

We conducted a cross-sectional study in a fencing club to collect anthropometric and biomechanical data from élite and novice fencers. Wearable sensors were used to collect biomechanical data, including a wireless inertial system and four surface electromyographic (sEMG) probes. Four different ML algorithms were trained for each dataset, and the most accurate was further trained with hyperparameter tuning. The best Machine Learning algorithm was Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), which had (Formula presented.) % accuracy and 90% precision, recall, and F1-score when predicting class novice (0); and 93% precision, recall, and F1-score when predicting class élite (1). Interestingly, the MLP model has a slightly higher capacity to recognize élite fencers than novices; this is important to determine which training planning and execution are the best to achieve good performances. © 2022 by the authors.",fencing; machine learning; smart health; wearable sensors,,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Methods: We evaluated isometric muscle strength in a standing position with the help of an exoskeleton that holds the subject and makes the test easily repeatable. Results: The optimal device angles for hip and knee were, respectively, 20° and 80° for flexor tests and 30° and 40° for extensor tests. Test–retest reliability was very high for the right knee extensor (ICC 0.96–0.98), left knee extensor (ICC 0.96–0.97), right knee flexor (ICC 0.91–0.96), and left knee flexor (ICC 0.96–0.97). Furthermore, the typical error in percent (T.E.%) ranged from 2.50 to 5.50%, and the change in the mean in percent ranged from 0.84 to 7.72%, making it possible to determine even a slight variation in force. Conclusions: this new method could represent a valid alternative for assessing strength, due to the high reliability and the favorable joint position, particularly in football. © 2023 by the authors.",dynamometer; extensor; isometric strength; knee flexors; maximum force; muscle strength assessment,,"""Application of Machine Learning and Biomechanics in Musculoskeletal Health and Wearable Devices""","Knee Assessment and Recovery: Validity, Reliability, and Clinical Trials",Effects of Training Protocols on Injury Prevention and Performance in Soccer and Futsal Players

Clinically, this measure enables the real-time monitoring of muscular recruitment patterns and breathing effort. Thus, it has the potential, for example, to help differentiate between respiratory disease and dysfunctional breathing, which otherwise can present with similar symptoms such as breath rate. Current automatic methods of measuring chest expansion are invasive, intrusive, and/or difficult to conduct in conjunction with pulmonary function testing (spontaneous breathing pressure and flow measurements). (2) Methods: A tape measure and rotary encoder band system developed by the authors was used to directly measure changes in thoracic and abdominal circumferences without the calibration required for analogous strain-gauge-based or image processing solutions. (3) Results: Using scaling factors from the literature allowed for the conversion of thoracic and abdominal motion to lung volume, combining motion measurements correlated to flow-based measured tidal volume (normalised by subject weight) with R2 = 0.79 in data from 29 healthy adult subjects during panting, normal, and deep breathing at 0 cmH2O (ZEEP), 4 cmH2O, and 8 cmH2O PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure). However, the correlation for individual subjects is substantially higher, indicating size and other physiological differences should be accounted for in scaling. The pattern of abdominal and chest expansion was captured, allowing for the analysis of muscular recruitment patterns over different breathing modes and the differentiation of active and passive modes. (4) Conclusions: The method and measuring device(s) enable the validation of patient-specific lung mechanics models and accurately elucidate diaphragmatic-driven volume changes due to intercostal/chest-wall muscular recruitment and elastic recoil. © 2023 by the authors.",abdominal; circumference; monitoring; muscular recruitment; respiratory mechanics; rotary encoder; thoracic,Abdomen; Adult; Diaphragm; Humans; Lung; Respiratory Mechanics; Thoracic Wall; Flow measurement; Noninvasive medical procedures; Signal encoding; Strain gages; Abdominal; Circumference; Mechanic model; Muscular recruitment; Non-invasive assessments; Rotary encoder; SIMPLE method; Spontaneous breathing; Thoracic; Volume change; abdomen; abdominal cavity; abdominal circumference; article; breathing; breathing mechanics; breathing rate; calibration; clinical article; controlled study; electric potential; female; flow measurement; human; hyperpnea; image processing; lung function; lung mechanics; lung volume; male; neurophysiological recruitment; non invasive procedure; normal human; positive end expiratory pressure ventilation; positive pressure ventilation; respiratory tract disease; strain gauge transducer; thorax; thorax wall; tidal volume; Biological organs,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation and Exercise Training

The purpose of this study was to upgrade the evidence of the most effective preventive physiotherapy interventions to improve back care in children and adolescents. Methods: The study settings were children or adolescents aged 18 years or younger. Data were obtained from the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, PEDro, Web of Science, LILACS, IBECS, and PsycINFO databases and the specialized journals BMJ and Spine. The included studies were published between May 2012 and May 2020. Controlled trials on children and adolescents who received preventive physiotherapy for back care were considered. Data on all the variables gathered in each individual study were extracted by two authors separately. Two authors assessed risk of bias of included studies using the RoB2 and quality of the body of evidence using the GRADE methodology. Data were described according to PRISMA guidelines. To calculate the effect size, a standardized mean difference “d” was used and a random-effects model was applied for the following outcome variables: behaviour, knowledge, trunk flexion muscle endurance, trunk extension muscle endurance, hamstring flexibility and posture. Results: Twenty studies were finally included. The most common physiotherapy interventions were exercise, postural hygiene and physical activity. The mean age of the total sample was 11.79 years. When comparing the change from baseline to end of intervention in treatment and control groups, the following overall effect estimates were obtained: behaviour d+ = 1.19 (95% CI: 0.62 and 1.76), knowledge d+ = 1.84 (0.58 and 3.09), trunk flexion endurance d+ = 0.65 (-0.02 and 1.33), trunk extension endurance d+ = 0.71 (0.38 and 1.03), posture d+ = 0.65 (0.24 and 1.07) and hamstrings flexibility d+ = 0.46 (0.36 and 0.56). At follow-up, the measurement of the behaviour variable was between 1 and 12 months, with an effect size of d+ = 1.00 (0.37 and 1.63), whereas the knowledge variable obtained an effect size of d+ = 2.08 (-0.85 and 5.02) at 3 months of follow-up. Conclusions: Recent studies provide strong support for the use of physiotherapy in the improvement of back care and prevention of non-specific low back pain in children and adolescents. Based on GRADE methodology, we found that the evidence was from very low to moderate quality and interventions involving physical exercise, postural hygiene and physical activity should be preferred. © 2022, The Author(s).",Adolescent; Child; Exercise; Low back pain; Meta-analysis; Physical therapy modalities; Primary prevention,"Adolescent; Child; Exercise; Humans; Low Back Pain; Physical Therapy Modalities; Posture; Range of Motion, Articular; adolescent; Article; attitude to health; body position; child; exercise; follow up; hamstring muscle; health belief; human; low back pain; motor control; muscle exercise; muscle function; outcome assessment; outcome variable; physical activity; physiotherapy; self concept; skill; systematic review; trunk; joint characteristics and functions; low back pain; meta analysis; physiotherapy","""Pain Management and Musculoskeletal Health in Various Populations""",Chronic Pain Management and Treatment Studies,Management and Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

Objective: Study the effect of double-balance jump rope training on athletes’ muscular strength in the lower limbs. Methods: Through the experimental process, the dynamic and kinematic parameters generated during the process of vertical jump of the participants before and after the double balance rope jump exercise were tested; the effects of double balance rope jump on the biomechanical characteristics of the lower limbs and hip, knee and ankle joints of the participants were analyzed. Results: Compared to pre-training, subjects in the experimental group improved significantly (p = 0.05). Conclusion: After double rope jump training, the subjects obtained an increase in lower limb strength and ground reaction force at the extension stage in the vertical jump. They produced greater force in less time, suggesting that the lower limb burst strength was enhanced.

Cushioning insoles may improve knee biomechanics and play a significant protective role. However, the impact of insoles with varying cushioning properties on knee joints in individuals with different body mass index (BMI) categories remains unknown. Our aim was to investigate the biomechanical effects of insoles with different cushioning properties on knee joints across different BMI grades. Methods: Gravity-driven impact tests were used to characterize the cushioning properties of three types of Artificial Cartilage Foam (ACF18, 28, and 38) and ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) insoles. Knee joint sagittal, coronal, and vertical axis angles and moments were collected from healthy-weight (BMI 18.5–23.9 kg/m2, n = 15), overweight (BMI 24.0–27.9 kg/m2, n = 16), and obese (BMI ≥28.0 kg/m2, n = 15) individuals randomly assigned four different insoles during a drop jump. The Kruskal–Wallis test and mixed model repeated measures analysis of variance were used to compare differences among cushioning and biomechanical data across various insoles, respectively. Results: ACF showed higher cushioning than EVA, and ACF38 was the highest among the three types of ACF (all p < 0.001). During the drop jump, the knee flexion angles and moments of the ACF insoles were lower than those of the EVA insoles, the knee adduction angles of the ACF18 and ACF28 insoles were lower than those of the EVA insoles, and ACF18 insoles increased the first cushion time (all p < 0.05) for all participants in whom biomechanical variables demonstrated no interactions between insoles and BMI. Regarding the BMI-dependent biomechanical variables, compared with the EVA insoles, ACF28 insoles decreased the knee flexion angle and ACF38 insoles decreased the knee adduction and rotation moment in the healthy-weight group; ACF18 insoles decreased the knee flexion angle and ACF38 insoles decreased the knee moment in the overweight group; ACF28 insoles decreased the knee flexion and adduction moment, and ACF38 insoles decreased the knee flexion angle and rotation moment in the obese group (all p < 0.05). Conclusion: Insoles with higher cushioning properties could improve knee biomechanics and provide better knee joint protection in people across different BMI ranges.

Lower body strength, upper body strength, aerobic endurance, flexibility, and change of direction performances were compared over time and with normative values. Females (p = .02), but not males, had an improvement in upper body strength over time. Females were also more flexible than males at both assessments (p ≤.02). Of those who had five consecutive assessments, females were more flexible than males (p ≤.05) and had a faster change of direction ability (p < .001).

Iliotibial band friction syndrome is a common chronic overuse injury caused by repetitive knee use in cycling. Self-myofascial release using foam rollers is an effective intervention for this syndrome; however, studies reporting positive results on self-myofascial release in cycling are limited. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of self-myofascial release on pain and iliotibial band flexibility, heart rate, and exercise performance (cadence, power, and record) in adult male cyclists with iliotibial band friction syndrome. We evaluated the pain and exercise ability of the control (n = 11) and self-myofascial release (n = 11) groups before and after cycling twice. Significant differences were observed in the pain scale, the iliotibial band flexibility, and cycling pain and power. The posterior cadence of the self-myofascial release group was 3.2% higher than that of the control group. The control group’s record time increased by 74.64 s in the second cycling session compared to the first cycling session, while that of the self-myofascial release group decreased by 30.91 s in the second cycling session compared to the first cycling session. Self-myofascial release is effective in relieving pain and may improve cycling performance by increasing the iliotibial band flexibility. © 2022 by the authors.",cycling; cycling performance; iliotibial band friction syndrome; pain; self-myofascial release,Adult; Cumulative Trauma Disorders; Humans; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Male; Myofascial Release Therapy; Pain; cycle transport; disease; injury; performance assessment; physical activity; adult; analgesia; Article; clinical article; controlled study; cycling; exercise; female; human; iliotibial band friction syndrome; male; myofascial release; process design; visual analog scale; complication; cumulative trauma disorder; knee; knee injury; pain,"""Pain Management and Musculoskeletal Health in Various Populations""",Chronic Pain Management and Treatment Studies,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Previous studies have confirmed lumbar proprioception impairments among individuals with Low Back Pain (LBP), which can afflict the normal central sensory-motor control and hence increases the risk of abnormal loading on the lumbar spine. Although the local investigation of proprioception is important, its influence on other joints in a kinetic chain particularly between extremities and spine should not be ignored. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the proprioception of knee joint in different trunk positions among females with chronic nonspecific low back pain (CNSLBP) and healthy females. Design: The study included 24 healthy subjects and 25 patients with CNSLBP participated in this study. Repositioning error of knee joint in four different lumbar positions including flexion, neutral position, 50% ROM of left rotation and 50% ROM right rotation was evaluated using an inclinometer. Absolute error and constant error were obtained and analyzed. Results: Absolute error in flexion and neutral positions in the individuals with CNSLBP were significantly higher than in healthy individuals; whereas, there was no significant difference in absolute and constant error between the two groups in 50% rotation to either side. Conclusion: This study showed that knee joint repositioning accuracy was reduced in patients with CNSLBP compared to healthy ones. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Kinesthesia; Knee joint; Low back pain; Position sense,Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Low Back Pain; Lumbar Vertebrae; Movement; Posture; Proprioception; accuracy; adult; Article; backache; body mass; clinical article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; daily life activity; error; female; human; joint function; kinesthesia; kinetics; knee function; knee joint; low back pain; lumbar spine; motor control; muscle reflex; physiotherapy; proprioception; radiculopathy; range of motion; rotation; trunk; visual analog scale; young adult; body position; lumbar vertebra; movement (physiology); physiology,"""Balance, Mobility, and Fall Risks in Aging and Musculoskeletal Conditions""",Impact and Control of Chronic Low Back Pain and Balance in Older Adults,Evaluation and Improvement of Postural Balance and Muscle Strength

This descriptive and cross-sectional study involved 1688 federated road cyclists, aiming to analyse the pattern of SS consumption concerning the degree of scientific evidence and different categories. This study categorised SS based on the groups and subgroups established by the Australian Sport Institute (AIS, 2023) based on the level of evidence. Our results showed that 62.5% of the sample cyclists used SS, with an average of 12.2 ± 8.6 supplements consumed per participant. Health status (78.2%), pharmacies (62.5%), and medical doctors (45.7%) were the main reasons, purchase sites, and sources of information for SS consumption, respectively. The most prevalent SS consumed were Sports Gels (94%), Sports Bars (89.3%), and Sports Drinks (73.8%). Notably, 80% of the top ten most consumed SS belonged to the group with the highest level of evidence according to the AIS, with an average of 6.9 ± 3.2 supplements per participant. However, 23.3% of the total SS consumers used prohibited substances. In conclusion, while the prevalence of SS consumption among road cyclists is considerable and the primary sources for purchasing SS and obtaining advice are reliable, there is a notable prevalence of prohibited substance use within the sample. © 2023 by the authors.",cycling; doping; ergogenic aids; performance; sport nutrition; sports supplements,Academies and Institutes; Athletic Performance; Australia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dietary Supplements; Humans; ascorbic acid; beta alanine; caffeine; casein hydrolysate; citrulline; creatine; electrolyte; gel; glutamine; iron; melatonin; mineral; nitrate; nutrition supplement; probiotic agent; adult; Article; athletic performance; controlled study; cross-sectional study; cyclist; descriptive research; diet supplementation; dietary intake; health status; human; information source; male; mineral supplementation; normal human; nutritional deficiency; pharmacy (shop); physician; prevalence; purchasing; Spirulina; sport nutrition; sports drink; vitamin supplementation; athletic performance; Australia; dietary supplement; organization,"""Physical Activity and Health Outcomes in Aging Populations""",Physical Activity and Health in Older Adults,Effects of Exercise and Supplementation on Performance and Health

Objectives: Examine exercise perceptions of SCI individuals enrolled in an exercise trial about their: (a) reasons for enrolling, (b) barriers to exercise, and (c) solutions to address barriers. Setting: World-wide web. Methods: US individuals ≥18 years old with SCI completed password-protected free-response surveys (n = 144) as part of a larger internet-based intervention to promote exercise. Participants’ online reporting about their motivations to exercise, barriers, and solutions to identified barriers were analyzed using an inductive thematic qualitative approach. Participants could enter up to 10 responses for each category. Results: Study staff analyzed 956 participant responses across questions regarding their motivations, barriers, and solutions. Leading reasons reported for enrolling were to improve their physical health (69%), function (61%), and attitude (59%) while commonly reported barriers were time constraints (54%), lack of motivation (31%), accessibility issues (24%), and SCI-specific barriers (23%). Participant-generated solutions were scheduling exercise (47.9%) for time constraints, making exercise more fun (21.8%) to increase motivation, obtaining home exercise equipment (30.3%), and locating accessible facilities (27.3%) to resolve accessibility barriers. Solutions for SCI-specific barriers of temperature control, skin breakdown, and pain included getting adapted equipment or finding exercises they could perform independently (29.3%) and enlisting support from friends or family (24.4%). Conclusions: The results offer insights about exercise motivators and barriers reported by people with SCI who enrolled in an exercise intervention program and offer insights regarding topics to address for SCI-tailored exercise programs. Further research should examine what strategies are most useful in helping people with SCI engage in exercise. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to International Spinal Cord Society.",,Adolescent; Cross-Sectional Studies; Exercise; Humans; Motivation; Spinal Cord Injuries; Surveys and Questionnaires; adult; Article; behavior change; cross-sectional study; educational status; employment status; exercise; female; health care access; human; income; major clinical study; male; middle aged; motivation; paraplegia; perception; qualitative analysis; spinal cord injury; thematic analysis; thorax injury; weakness; web-based intervention; adolescent; motivation; physiology; questionnaire; spinal cord injury,"""Physical Activity and Rehabilitation in Adults with Neurological Conditions""",Physical Activity and Rehabilitation Post-Injury,Physical Activity Engagement Barriers and Facilitators for Stroke Survivors

Due to the duration of the training session or the need for an instructor, these supervised programs are rather difficult to implement. For this reason, numerous companies, especially companies in manual sectors, are turning to another solution, i.e. warm-up intervention before the work shift. These interventions present various advantages such as short duration and the possibility to perform exercises in working clothes. Surprisingly, while the positive effects of warm-up interventions on pain, performance, and physical and psychological capacities are expansively reported in the sport context, effects of workplace warm-up intervention are lacking. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess the acute effects of three different warm-up interventions on physical (pain, strength, flexibility) and psychological (workload) functions and also on work-related outcomes (work performance, readiness to work) among vineyard workers. METHODS: A cluster randomized study will be implemented among French vineyard workers. Four groups of 30 participants will be constituted; corresponding to four different conditions: (1) hybrid warm-up intervention (HWU); (2) dynamic warm-up intervention (DWU); (3) stretching warm-up intervention (SWU); (4) no warm-up intervention (NWU). A total of 120 vineyard workers will be recruited to participate in the study. CONCLUSION: The results will provide more evidence about the short-term effects of warm-up interventions at the workplace and will provide more evidence on which warm-up modality is the most effective on pain, performance, and physical and psychological capacities among vineyard workers.  © 2023 - IOS Press.

Understanding the influential factors associated with frailty may help prevent or if possible reverse frailty. The present study aimed to investigate factors associated with frailty status and frailty transition in a community-dwelling older population. Methods: A prospective cohort study on community-dwelling subjects aged ≥ 60 years was conducted, which was registered beforehand (ChiCTR 2,000,032,949). Participants who had completed two visits during 2020–2021 were included. Frailty status was evaluated using the Fried frailty phenotype. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was applied for variable selection. Bayesian network analysis with the max-min hill-climbing (MMHC) algorithm was used to identify factors related to frailty status and frailty transition. Results: Of 1,981 subjects at baseline, 1,040 (52.5%) and 165 (8.33%) were classified as prefrailty and frailty. After one year, improved, stable, and worsening frailty status was observed in 460 (35.6%), 526 (40.7%), and 306 (23.7%) subjects, respectively. Based on the variables screened by LASSO regression, the Bayesian network structure suggested that age, nutritional status, instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), balance capacity, and social support were directly related to frailty status. The probability of developing frailty is 14.4% in an individual aged ≥ 71 years, which increases to 20.2% and 53.2% if the individual has balance impairment alone, or combined with IADL disability and malnutrition. At a longitudinal level, ADL/IADL decline was a direct predictor of worsening in frailty state, which further increased the risk of hospitalization. Low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) levels were related to malnutrition, and further had impacts on ADL/IADL decline, and ultimately led to the worsening of the frailty state. Knowing the status of any one or more of these factors can be used to infer the risk of frailty based on conditional probabilities. Conclusion: Older age, malnutrition, IADL disability, and balance impairment are important factors for identifying frailty. Malnutrition and ADL/IADL decline further predict worsening of the frailty state. © 2022, The Author(s).",Bayesian analysis; Frail older adults; Risk factors,Activities of Daily Living; Aged; Bayes Theorem; Frail Elderly; Frailty; Geriatric Assessment; Humans; Independent Living; Malnutrition; Prospective Studies; aged; Bayes theorem; complication; daily life activity; frail elderly; frailty; geriatric assessment; human; independent living; malnutrition; prospective study,"""Physical Activity and Health Outcomes in Aging Populations""",Physical Activity and Health in Older Adults,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

The aim is to achieve an understanding of the meaning of physical activity one year after participating in a high-intensity exercise training program. Method: Twelve people were interviewed using a phenomenological hermeneutic approach. Results: Four themes were formulated and revealed that one year after participating in high-intensity exercise training participants had an awareness of the meaning of the project, their chest pain and daily life: Being reassured, Daily life’s impact on chest pain and continuing doing high-intensity exercise training, A strengthened body and mind, Being part of a group of people with similar problems. Comprehensive understanding was formulated as “Being reassured according being physically active in a background of vulnerability”. Conclusion: This study indicates that by going through the high-intensity exercise training program the person regains more unity with the lived body and an unfolding life. A person-centred approach is suggested including an underlying dimension of vulnerability. A lifeworld led care means meeting the patient in their way of relating to the world bodily and existentially.

PCS represents a major health issue worldwide because it severely impacts patients’ work activities and their quality of life. In the absence of treatment for both conditions and given the beneficial effect of pacing strategies in ME/CFS, we conducted this study to assess the effectiveness of pacing in PCS patients. Methods: We retrospectively included patients meeting the World Health Organization definition of PCS who attended the Internal Medicine Department of Angers University Hospital, France between June 2020 and June 2022, and were followed up until December 2022. Pacing strategies were systematically proposed for all patients. Their medical records were reviewed and data related to baseline and follow-up assessments were collected. This included epidemiological characteristics, COVID-19 symptoms and associated conditions, fatigue features, perceived health status, employment activity, and the degree of pacing adherence assessed by the engagement in pacing subscale (EPS). Recovery was defined as the ability to return to work, and improvement was regarded as the reduction of the number and severity of symptoms. Results: A total of 86 patients were included and followed-up for a median time of 10 [6–13] months. Recovery and improvement rates were 33.7% and 23.3%, respectively. The EPS score was the only variable significantly associated with recovery on multivariate analysis (OR 40.43 [95% CI 6.22–262.6], p < 0.001). Patients who better adhered to pacing (high EPS scores) experienced significantly higher recovery and improvement rates (60–33.3% respectively) than those with low (5.5–5.5% respectively), or moderate (4.3–17.4% respectively) scores. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that pacing is effective in the management of patients with PCS, and that high levels of adherence to pacing are associated with better outcomes. © 2023, The Author(s).",Adherence; Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome; Outcomes; Pacing strategies; Post-COVID syndrome,"COVID-19; Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic; Humans; Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome; Quality of Life; Retrospective Studies; adult; Article; disease association; disease severity; employment; engagement in pacing subscale; epidemiology; fatigue; female; follow up; France; health care management; health status; human; human cell; long COVID; major clinical study; male; medical record; patient compliance; retrospective study; return to work; scoring system; therapy effect; treatment outcome; university hospital; chronic fatigue syndrome; coronavirus disease 2019; long COVID; quality of life","""Impacts of COVID-19 on Physical and Mental Health, Exercise Habits, and Rehabilitation Strategies""","Impact of COVID-19 on Health, Physical Activity and Quality of Life",Post-COVID-19 Syndrome and Rehabilitation Strategies

Strong evidence supports the absence of a direct relationship between the intensity of pain and tissue damage, with psychosocial factors also playing a crucial role. In this context, the Pain Attitudes and Beliefs Scale for Physiotherapists (PABS-PT) is a useful tool for evaluating physiotherapists’ treatment orientations and beliefs regarding the management of low back pain (LBP). It helps identify practitioners who may benefit from additional education in modern pain neuroscience. However, there is not a Spanish validation of this scale for physiotherapists. Thus, the aims of this study were to translate and culturally adapt the Pain Attitudes and Beliefs Scale for Physiotherapists (PABS-PT) into Spanish and to evaluate its psychometric properties. This validation study used three convenience samples of physiotherapists (PTs) (n = 22 for the pilot study, n = 529 for the validity study and n = 53 for assessing the instrument’s responsiveness). The process of translating and adapting the PABS-PT into Spanish followed international guidelines and produced a satisfactory pre-final version of the questionnaire. Factor analysis confirmed the two-factor structure of the original version, with the biomedical (BM) factor explaining 39.4% of the variance and the biopsychosocial (BPS) factor explaining 13.8% of the variance. Cronbach’s alpha values were excellent for the BM factor (0.86) and good for the BPS factor (0.77), indicating good internal consistency. Test–retest reliability was excellent for both factors, with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of 0.84 for BM and 0.82 for BPS. The standard error of measurement (SEM) was acceptable for both factors (3.9 points for BM and 2.4 points for BPS). Concurrent validity was moderate and in the expected direction and had significant correlations with the Health Care Providers’ Pain and Impairment Relationship Scale (HC-PAIRS) and Revised Neurophysiology Pain Questionnaire (R-NPQ). Sensitivity to change was demonstrated by significant improvements in both factors after an educational intervention, with medium-to-large effect sizes. The PABS-PT also showed good discriminative ability, as it was able to distinguish between physiotherapists with and without pain education. Cut-off values for the BM and BPS factors were determined. In conclusion, the translated and adapted Spanish version of the PABS-PT demonstrated good psychometric properties and can be reliably used to assess the attitudes and beliefs of Spanish-speaking physiotherapists regarding LBP. The questionnaire is recommended for use in clinical and educational research in the Spanish language context. © 2023 by the authors.",attitude; beliefs scale; low back pain; physical therapists; psychometrics,adaptation; adult; Article; attitude assessment; concurrent validity; controlled study; convenience sample; correlation coefficient; Cronbach alpha coefficient; cross-sectional study; cultural factor; effect size; factor analysis; female; Health Care Providers Pain and Impairment Relationship Scale; human; internal consistency; low back pain; male; pain assessment; Pain Attitudes and Beliefs Scale for Physiotherapist; physiotherapist; pilot study; practice guideline; psychometry; questionnaire; rating scale; Revised Neurophysiology Pain Questionnaire; Spanish (language); test retest reliability; validation study,"""Pain Management and Musculoskeletal Health in Various Populations""",Chronic Pain Management and Treatment Studies,Management and Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Web of Science, PubMed, and CNKI databases were used to identify studies. Literature search, data extraction and bias risk assessment were conducted independently by two authors. A total of 25 articles were included, involving 844 young adults with an average age of 17.4±1.7 years. The minimum effective exercise intervention dose (Cohen’s d>0.5) to induce cardiopulmonary enhancement in young adults was 35-50% exercise intensity, 0-35 min exercise time, 2-3 day/week frequency, and 4-5 week exercise duration. The range of exercise intensity, time, frequency, and cycle that have a large effect on improving cardiopulmonary function is 60-69%, 36-45 min and >56 min, 6-7 sessions/week and >8 sessions/week, ≥4 weeks respectively. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The interaction effect results among the elements of exercise prescription: 1) no matter how the single exercise time changes, when the exercise intensity is controlled in the range of 51-70%, there will be a large enhancement effect; 2) when the weekly exercise time is less than 150 min, 51-70% of the exercise intensity will get great enhancement effect; 3) when the weekly exercise time is longer than 150 min, 35-50% and 51-70% of exercise intensity can produce great enhancement effect. A 35-50% exercise intensity, 36-45 min exercise time, ≥8 sessions/ week exercise frequency and 4-5 week exercise duration had the best enhancement effect on male youth. A 51-70% exercise intensity, 36-45 min exercise time, ≥8 sessions/week exercise frequency and 4-5 week exercise duration had the best enhancement effect on female youth. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, there was a dose-effect relationship between exercise intervention and improvement of cardiorespiratory fitness in young people. The optimal exercise dose for improving cardiorespiratory fitness in young people was 60-69% exercise intensity, 36-45 min exercise time, ≥8 sessions/week exercise frequency, and 4-5 weeks exercise cycle, respectively. However, attention must be paid to gender differences.

Thus, the enhancement of quadriceps strength and proprioceptive accuracy can play a pivotal role in the management of knee OA. This study aimed to investigate the effects of Kinesio tape and flexible knee orthosis in terms of clinical and neuromuscular outcomes in patients with knee OA. Methods: This clinical trial was conducted on 56 patients with knee OA, randomly allocated to two groups: knee orthosis or Kinesio tape. The knee orthosis group wore a neoprene knee support for 4 weeks. For participants in the Kinesio tape group, tape was applied once a week, for 4 weeks. The primary outcomes were pain intensity and physical function evaluated through the visual analog scale and the Western Ontario and McMaster OA index. The secondary outcomes were concentric and isometric quadriceps strength, Joint Position Sense (JPS), Threshold to Detect Passive Motion (TTDPM), and force sense (FS), all measured by isokinetic dynamometry. Results: All outcome measures were significantly improved in the orthosis group. The Kinesio tape group also demonstrated significant changes in all outcome measures except three proprioception components namely JPS (70° target), FS, and TTDPM. At the end of the fourth week, there were no significant between-group differences for measured parameters. Conclusion: Wearing a flexible knee orthosis and/or Kinesio tape for 4 weeks significantly improved knee pain, physical function, and quadriceps strength. Although knee orthosis showed significant beneficial effects on various components of proprioception, there were no significant differences between the two groups at the end of the 4-week intervention. © 2023 Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

Mechanical impingement, in which the aspherical femoral head (cam morphology) abuts with the acetabular rim, is created with simultaneous hip flexion, internal rotation, and adduction. Impaired function of the gluteal muscles may be contributory to femoroacetabular impingement syndrome progression. The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of gluteal muscle recruitment on acetabular contact pressure during squatting in persons with cam femoroacetabular impingement syndrome. Methods: Eight individuals (4 males, 4 females) with a diagnosis of cam femoroacetabular impingement syndrome underwent CT imaging of the pelvis and proximal femora, and a biomechanical assessment of squatting (kinematics, kinetics, and electromyography). Two maximal depth bodyweight squat conditions were evaluated: 1) non-cued squatting; and 2) cued gluteal activation squatting. Utilizing subject-specific electromyography-driven hip and finite element modeling approaches, hip muscle activation, kinematics, bone-on-bone contact forces, and peak acetabular contact pressure were compared between squat conditions. Findings: Modest increases in gluteus maximus (7% MVIC, P < 0.0001) and medius (6% MVIC, P = 0.009) activation were able to reduce hip internal rotation on average 5° (P = 0.024), and in doing so reduced acetabular contact pressure by 32% (P = 0.023). Reductions in acetabular contact pressure occurred despite no change in hip abduction and increased bone-on-bone contact forces occurring in the cued gluteal activation condition. Interpretation: Our findings highlight the importance of gluteal activation in minimizing mechanical impingement and provide a foundation for interventions aimed at preventing the development and progression of femoroacetabular impingement syndrome. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Cam morphology; Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome; Finite element analysis; Gluteus maximus; Gluteus medius; Hip internal rotation; Patient-specific models,"Acetabulum; Female; Femoracetabular Impingement; Finite Element Analysis; Hip; Hip Joint; Humans; Male; Range of Motion, Articular; Activation analysis; Cams; Chemical activation; Computerized tomography; Finite element method; Kinematics; Muscle; Cam morphology; Contact pressures; Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome; Finite element analyse; Gluteus maximus; Gluteus medius; Hip internal rotation; Internal rotations; Mechanical; Patient-specific modeling; abduction; acetabulum; adult; Article; body weight; clinical article; controlled study; electromyography; female; femoroacetabular impingement; finite element analysis; gluteus maximus muscle; gluteus medius muscle; gluteus muscle; hip muscle; human; joint mobility; kinematics; kinetics; male; muscle contraction; neurophysiological recruitment; x-ray computed tomography; acetabulum; finite element analysis; hip; joint characteristics and functions; physiology; Morphology","""Application of Machine Learning and Biomechanics in Musculoskeletal Health and Wearable Devices""","Knee Assessment and Recovery: Validity, Reliability, and Clinical Trials",Hip Arthroscopy Outcomes and Rehabilitation

Design: Cross-Sectional Study. Setting: Online survey at one university. Participants: Of the 385 respondents surveyed online, 140 were identified as having experienced at least one LAS (CAI group: 69, coper group: 24, LAS group not classified as either: 47). Main outcome measures: Factors associated with the presence of pain during activities of daily living (ADL) and sports were identified using multivariate logistic regression analyses. Independent variables were demographics, injury characteristics, the Identification of Functional Ankle Instability (IdFAI) score, the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure Sports (FAAM-Sports) and ADL subscales, and the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia-11 score. Results: The prevalence of pain during ADL and sports in the three groups was 16.7%–42.0% and 33.3%–56.5%, respectively. FAAM-Sports and IdFAI score were significantly associated with pain during ADL and sports in the CAI group (odd ratio: 0.923 and 1.145), respectively. No significant pain-related factors were found in the coper and LAS groups. Conclusions: Lower self-reported function and greater perceived ankle instability may be important factors in pain management in athletes with CAI. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Ankle injury; Ankle instability; Psychological factor; Sport injury,Activities of Daily Living; Ankle Injuries; Ankle Joint; Athletes; Chronic Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Joint Instability; Pain; adult; analgesia; ankle instability; ankle sprain; Article; chronic ankle instability; clinical outcome; controlled study; cross-sectional study; daily life activity; exercise; fear; female; Foot and Ankle Ability Measure Sports scale; human; Identification of Functional Ankle Instability score; lateral ankle sprain; major clinical study; male; medical history; pain assessment; prevalence; scoring system; self report; student athlete; Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia 11 score; ankle; ankle injury; athlete; chronic disease; joint instability; pain,"""Pain Management and Musculoskeletal Health in Various Populations""",Chronic Pain Management and Treatment Studies,Effects of different training methods on athletic performance and injury prevention

In the Weight Loss and Exercise for Communities with Arthritis in North Carolina (WE-CAN) study, a community-based diet and exercise (D + E) intervention led to an additional 6 kg weight loss and 20% greater pain relief in persons with knee OA and body mass index (BMI) >27 kg/m2 relative to a group-based health education (HE) intervention. We sought to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of the usual care (UC), UC + HE, and UC + (D + E) programs, comparing each strategy with the “next-best” strategy ranked by increasing lifetime cost. Methods: We used the Osteoarthritis Policy Model to project long-term clinical and economic benefits of the WE-CAN interventions. We considered three strategies: UC, UC + HE, and UC + (D + E). We derived cohort characteristics, weight, and pain reduction from the WE-CAN trial. Our outcomes included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), cost, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Results: In a cohort with mean age 65 years, BMI 37 kg/m2, and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain score 38 (scale 0–100, 100 = worst), UC leads to 9.36 QALYs/person, compared with 9.44 QALYs for UC + HE and 9.49 QALYS for UC + (D + E). The corresponding lifetime costs are $147,102, $148,139, and $151,478. From the societal perspective, UC + HE leads to an ICER of $12,700/QALY; adding D + E to UC leads to an ICER of $61,700/QALY. Conclusion: The community-based D + E program for persons with knee OA and BMI >27kg/m2 could be cost-effective for willingness-to-pay thresholds greater than $62,000/QALY. These findings suggest that incorporation of community-based D + E programs into OA care may be beneficial for public health.

It is proposed that the changes in postural steadiness in sitting reflect the trunk control better than those in standing, but the previous study results are inconsistent. Thus, this study aimed to compare trunk sway parameters during standing and sitting between patients with chronic LPB (CLBP) and controls using a tracker-based posturography to record the trunk displacement trajectories at the lumbar level (TD L). A total of 64 participants (32 patients with CLBP and 32 pain-free controls) were included in this study. The postural sway was measured under four conditions, sitting or standing on unstable surface, with eyes open or closed. The TDL parameters were compared between the two groups to explore their discriminative ability. The CLBP group had more body sway than the control group, characterized by several TDL parameters in sitting with eyes closed and standing with eyes open. The TDL parameters with the highest area under the curve according to the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were the root mean square distance and mean frequency in the medial-lateral direction obtained in the sitting with eyes closed. In conclusion, we confirmed the advantage of using sitting posturographic parameters as a sensitive measure to detect impaired trunk control in patients with CLBP. The results would help choose sensitive outcome measures to reflect the postural control of patients with LBP.  © 2001-2011 IEEE.",Biomechanics; instruments; measurement; virtual reality,Patient treatment; Atmospheric measurement; Chronic low back pain; Displacements measurements; Lower back pain; Pain; Particle measurement; Postural control; Postural steadiness; Posturography; Trunk sways; adult; aged; area under the curve; Article; body height; body position; body weight; clinical article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diagnostic test accuracy study; discriminant analysis; eyelid closure; female; follow up; human; low back pain; male; pain severity; postural steadiness; receiver operating characteristic; Roland Morris disability questionnaire; sensitivity and specificity; sitting; stabilography; standing; trunk; visual analog scale; Virtual reality,"""Balance, Mobility, and Fall Risks in Aging and Musculoskeletal Conditions""",Impact and Control of Chronic Low Back Pain and Balance in Older Adults,Evaluation and Improvement of Postural Balance and Muscle Strength

Among these, anterior cruciate ligament injuries are pretty common. Anterior cruciate ligament damage leads to instability and results in functional limitations. For this reason, postoperative rehabilitation is crucial for returning to sports. METHODS: This study included 24 male recreational athletes aged 18-35 years who underwent ACL surgery at least one year before and could not return to their pre-injury activity level. An eight-week protocol composed of strength, balance, plyometric and proprioceptive exercises was implemented. Functional questionnaires were applied before and after the protocol. In addition, isokinetic strength, balance scores, and concurrent EMG activities were measured. RESULTS: Significant differences were found between the strength, balance tests, and EMG data obtained before, during, and after the exercise program (P<0.05). Also, there were significant differences in functional questionnaire scores (P<0.05). All participants could successfully return to their pre-injury activities. There was no correlation between EMG data and isokinetic strength values (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Isokinetic strength and balance measurements, EMG parameters, and functional questionnaire scores have revealed that the exercise protocol is effective and can be used in deciding to return to sports. In addition, EMG analysis can be used in proper movement management during rehabilitation, aiding strength development and monitoring muscle fatigue. However, it can not be used as a criterion for returning to sports.

Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) disturbances are a common pathological feature of pediatric concussion, though no studies have explicitly examined sex-differences with respect to this outcome, precluding a sex-specific understanding of the functional neuropathology of pediatric concussion. Therefore, we performed a secondary data analysis of rs-fMRI data collected on children with concussion (n = 29) recruited from in a pediatric hospital setting, with greater than 12:1 matched control data accessed from the open-source ABIDE-II database. Seed-based and region of interest (ROI) analyses were used to examine sex-based rs-fMRI differences; threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) and a family-wise error (FWE) corrected p-values were used to identify significantly different clusters. In comparing females with concussion to healthy females, groupwise differences were observed irrespective of seed selected. Notably, we observed (in order of largest effect) hypo-connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex of the salience network and the thalamus and precuneus (TFCE = 1473.5, p-FWE < 0.001) and the cingulate gyrus (TFCE = 769.3, p-FWE = 0.009), and the seed (posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)) of the default mode network and the paracingulate gyrus (TFCE = 1275.7, p-FWE < 0.001), occipital pole right (TFCE = 1045.0, p-FWE = 0.001), and sub-callosal cortex (TFCE = 844.9, p-FWE = 0.005). Hyper-connectivity was observed between the salience network seed and the cerebellum (TFCE = 1719.3, p-FWE < 0.001) and the PCC and the thalamus (TFCE = 1198.3, p-FWE < 0.001), cuneal cortex (1070.9, p-FWE = 0.001), and lateral occipital cortex left (TFCE = 832.8, p-FWE = 0.006). ROI analyses showed 10 and 5 significant clusters of hypo- and hyper-connectivity in females, respectively. Only one cluster of difference was found between males with concussion and healthy males on seed-based analyses, and 3 clusters on ROI analyses. There are alterations in rs-fMRI in females with concussion at one-month post-injury that are minimally present in males, which provides further evidence that recovery timelines in pediatric concussion may differ by sex. © 2023, The Author(s).",,Brain; Brain Concussion; Brain Mapping; Cerebral Cortex; Child; Female; Gyrus Cinguli; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; brain; brain concussion; brain cortex; brain mapping; child; cingulate gyrus; female; human; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures,"""Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion: Studies on Impacts, Recovery, and Influences""",Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion Studies in Young Athletes,Post-Concussion Symptoms and Recovery in Adolescents

It causes acute localized neurological abnormalities such as weakness, sensory deficit, or language issues that require long-term treatment. These deficiencies harm the patient and their family psychologically, socially, and economically. Thus, combination treatment can rapidly rehabilitate such patients. Detoxification methods like Ayurvedic medicated enema help stroke pathophysiology. Physical modalities in physiotherapy have been shown to facilitate normal movement and function on the stroke patient’s affected side, increasing independence with everyday duties. A stroke patient may benefit from Dashmoola Niruha Basti, Function Electrical Stimulation (FES), and Motor Relearning Programme (MRP). Aim & Objectives: This study compares the adjuvant role of Dashmoola Basti with MRP and FES in stroke recovery. The main goals of this study are to assess and compare the adjuvant role of Dashmoola Basti with standard control over sensorimotor function of lower extremities, static and dynamic balance in stroke patients; gait parameters; resistance experienced during passive range of motion; quality of life of patients; Barthel Index; Modified Ashworth Scale; and Fuglmeyer assessment, Single Limb Stance Test, Functional Reach Test. Methods: A total of 40 patients will be enrolled and divided randomly into two equal groups. In Group A (control), standard treatment (modern + physiotherapy) will be prescribed for one month. In Group B (interventional group), Dashmoola Basti will be added to the aforementioned standard treatment for one month. Expected results: Improvement in Fuglmeyer assessment, Single Limb Stance Test, Functional Reach Test, quality of Life of Patients, Barthel Index, Modified Ashworth scale, and National Institute of Health (NIH) stroke-scale-score will be observed and recorded.

The position and posture of the foot and ankle may also play an important role in proprioceptive input.Therefore, the current research aims to compare static balance and ankle and knee proprioception in people with and without flexible flatfeet. Methodology: 91 female students between the ages of 18 and 25 voluntarily participated in this study, of which 24 were in the flexible flatfoot group and 67 were in the regular foot group after evaluating the longitudinal arch of the foot. The position sense of ankle and knee joints were measured using the active reconstruction test of the ankle and knee angle; Static balance was measured using the Sharpened Romberg test. Data were non-normally distributed. Accordingly, non-parametric tests were applied. The Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to compare differences between groups in variables. Result: Kruskal-Wallis test showed a significant difference between two groups of flat feet and normal feet in the variables of static balance and position sense of ankle plantarflexion, ankle dorsiflexion, and knee flexion (p ≤ 0.05). A significant correlation was found between static balance and sense of ankle and knee position in the group with normal feet. The analysis of the regression line also showed that ankle and knee position sense could predict the static balance score in the regular foot group (ankle dorsiflexion position sense 17% (R2 = 0.17), ankle plantarflexion position sense 17% (R2 = 0.17) and knee flexion position sense 46% (R2 = 0.46) explain of changes in static balance). Discussion & conclusion: Flexible flatfoot soles can cause loss of balance and sense of joint position; therefore, according to this preliminary study, clinicians must be aware and should take into account this possible deficit in the management of these patients. © 2023, The Author(s).",Ankle and knee joints; Balance control; Flexible pes planus; Position sense,Adolescent; Adult; Ankle; Ankle Joint; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Flatfoot; Humans; Knee Joint; Postural Balance; Posture; Proprioception; Young Adult; adult; ankle dorsiflexion; ankle plantarflexion; ankle proprioception; Article; body equilibrium; body position; clinical article; controlled study; core stability; cross-sectional study; female; flexible flatfoot; foot; foot longitudinal arch; foot posture; function test; human; joint stability; knee function; knee proprioception; leg movement; proprioception; Sharpened Romberg test; young adult; adolescent; ankle; body equilibrium; body position; case report; flatfoot; knee; physiology; proprioception,"""Effects of Various Interventions on Postural Stability and Balance Control""",Postural Stability and Lower Limb Motor Control Studies,Evaluation and Improvement of Postural Balance and Muscle Strength

Materials and Methods: Patients affected by knee osteoarthritis between September 2020 and February 2022 were enrolled in this case-control study. Patients were randomly divided into two groups (n = 50, each): the study group received postoperative CCF therapy while the control group was treated by cold pack (gel ice). The CCF device is a computer-assisted therapy with continuous cold fluid, allowing a selective distribution, constant and uniform, of cold or hot on the areas to be treated. In both groups, pre- and postoperative evaluations at 6, 24, 72 h and at the fifth day were conducted using Visual Analogic Scale (VAS), opioid consumption, passive range of motion, preoperative hematocrit, total blood loss by Gross formula, transfusion requirement and patient satisfaction questionnaire. Results: One hundred patients, 52 women (52%), were included in the study. Reduction of pain, opioid consumption and increase in passive range of movement were statistically significantly demonstrated in the study group on the first and third days. Patients were satisfied with adequate postoperative pain management due to CCF therapy (p = 0.01) and they would recommend this treatment to others (p = 0.01). Conclusions: A continuous cold flow device in the acute postoperative setting after total knee arthroplasty is associated with pain reduction and improving early movement. Patients were almost satisfied with the procedure. The management of perioperative pain control could improve participation in the early rehabilitation program as demonstrated by the increase in ROM, psychological satisfaction and reduction in opioid use. © 2022 by the authors.",continuous cold flow therapy; cryotherapy; opioids consumption; pain; patient satisfaction; total knee arthroplasty,"Analgesics, Opioid; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Case-Control Studies; Female; Humans; Pain, Postoperative; Range of Motion, Articular; Treatment Outcome; narcotic analgesic agent; adverse event; case control study; controlled study; female; human; joint characteristics and functions; knee replacement; postoperative pain; randomized controlled trial; rehabilitation; treatment outcome","""Application of Machine Learning and Biomechanics in Musculoskeletal Health and Wearable Devices""","Knee Assessment and Recovery: Validity, Reliability, and Clinical Trials",Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation in Osteoarthritis Patients

We hypothesized that there would be no differences between both techniques when using a triangular allograft impaction technique. Methods: A single-centre, observational, retrospective study was conducted on 103 opening-wedge high tibial osteotomy patients from January 2017 to September 2019. Data collection, NRS and KOOS-PS, was performed preoperatively, 3 months and 12 months postoperatively. Radiological assessment (Kellgren-Lawrence, mechanical femoral-tibial angle, posterior tibial slope angle, lateral patellar tilt, patellar height) was performed on standing radiographs. Results: In total 32 patients were included in the biplanar group and 71 patients in the monoplanar group. NRS and KOOS-PS scores improved significantly (p < 0.001) in time for both groups from baseline to 3 m PO and further to 1 year postoperatively. Our results showed no differences in radiological outcomes such as patellar height, LPT and posterior tibial slope angle. The monoplanar group did have more Takeuchi I and III fractures and a higher mFTA angle without clinical repercussion. Conclusions: Using a triangular allograft impaction technique for monoplanar and biplanar medial opening-wedge high tibial osteotomy gives no differences in clinical (NRS and KOOS) and radiological outcomes. Although a difference in Takeuchi fractures was found for monoplanar patients, no additional fixation was necessary, nor did clinical complications occur. We can conclude that triangular allograft impaction technique creates a stable construct and standardizes the healing procedure postoperatively for both monoplanar and biplanar medial opening-wedge high tibial osteotomy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Biplanar; Medial opening-wedge High tibial osteotomy; Medial osteoarthritis; Monoplanar,"Allografts; Fractures, Bone; Humans; Knee Joint; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Osteotomy; Patella; Retrospective Studies; Tibia; adult; Article; biplanar medial opening wedge high tibial osteotomy; bone allograft; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; female; fracture healing; human; Kellgren-Lawrence grade; Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score; lateral patellar tilt; leg fracture; lower limb radiographic parameter; major clinical study; male; mechanical femorotibial angle; medial opening wedge high tibial osteotomy; numeric rating scale; observational study; patellar height; posterior tibial slope angle; postoperative period; preoperative period; retrospective study; Takeuchi fracture; tibia osteotomy; triangular allograft impaction technique; allograft; case report; diagnostic imaging; fracture; knee; knee osteoarthritis; osteotomy; patella; procedures; tibia","""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Patellar Dislocation: Treatment and Rehabilitation Methods

Joint moment contributions (JMCs) and support moments during incline and decline running are unknown in healthy young adults and individuals with an ACLR. Understanding these conditional joint-level changes could explain the increased incidence of OA that develops in the long term. Therefore, this knowledge may provide insight into the rehabilitation and prevention of OA development. We aimed to identify the interlimb and between-group differences in peak support moments and subsequent peak ankle, knee, and hip JMCs between individuals with an ACLR and matched controls during different sloped running conditions. A total of 17 individuals with unilateral ACLR and 17 healthy individuals who were matched based on sex, height, and mass participated in this study. The participants ran on an instrumented treadmill at an incline of 4°, decline of 4°, incline of 10°, and decline of 10°. The last 10 strides of each condition were used to compare the whole-stance phase support moments and JMCs between limbs, ACLR, and control groups and across conditions. No differences in JMCs were identified between limbs or between the ACLR and healthy control groups across all conditions. Support moments did not change among the different sloped conditions, but JMCs significantly changed. Specifically, ankle and knee JMCs decreased and increased by 30% and 33% from an incline of 10° to a decline of 10° running. Here, the lower extremities can redistribute mechanics across the ankle, knee, and hip while maintaining consistent support moments during incline and decline running. Our data provide evidence that those with an ACLR do not exhibit significant alterations in joint contributions while running on sloped conditions compared to the matched controls. Our findings inform future research interested in understanding the relationship between sloped running mechanics and the incidence of deleterious acute or chronic problems in people with an ACLR. 2023 Harrison, Holmes, Finley, Guzman, Kimbrough and Roper.",adaptation; anterior cruciate ligament; biomechanics; environmental demands; osteoarthritis; rehabilitation,,"""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Advancements and Outcomes of Knee Arthroplasty and Rehabilitation Techniques

However, previous research is limited by its scope of measures and study populations. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between foot and ankle joint range of motion on barefoot plantar pressures during walking in healthy older adults. Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited 49 older adults. Participants underwent measures of foot (first metatarsophalangeal dorsiflexion range of motion, and navicular drop and drift) and ankle joint range of motion, foot posture, body mass index, and plantar pressure during barefoot walking. Spearman Rank Order Correlations were used to explore the relationship between foot and ankle measures, body mass index, and plantar pressure, with significant correlations explored in a hierarchical regression analysis. A Mann-Whitney U test was performed to compare plantar pressure values between those with and without ankle equinus per region of the foot. Results: Mean (SD) age and BMI were 72.4 years (5.2) and 29.8 kg/m2 (5.9) respectively. A total of 32 of the 49 participants (65%) identified as female sex. Mean (SD) ankle joint range of motion was 32.7 (6.4) degrees with 17/49 (34.7%) participants classified as having an ankle equinus (defined as < 30 degrees of ankle joint dorsiflexion range of motion). We found that an ankle equinus predicted a statistically significant amount of peak forefoot plantar pressure (p = 0.03). Participants with an ankle equinus displayed significantly higher forefoot peak pressure 677.8 kPa (589.9 to 810.4) compared to those with no equinus 565.58 kPa (447.3 to 651.2), p = 0.02. A statistically significant correlation was found between body mass index and midfoot peak pressure (p < 0.01) and pressure-time integral (p < 0.01). No other significant correlations were found.

However, the dose–response relationship currently remains undetermined. This study aims to explore the dose–response relationship between PA during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy and GDM risk. Methods: Studies on the relationship between PA during pregnancy and GDM risk published before April 25, 2023, were searched for in six databases. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, all literature was screened for eligibility. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess risk of bias. Publication bias was examined using funnel plots, Begg’s and Egger’s tests, as well as trim-and-fill analysis. We harmonized exposure estimates of PA during pregnancy to the common unit of the metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-h/week. Restricted cubic splines were used to model the dose–response relationship. The criteria from the World Cancer Research Fund were used to assess the certainty of evidence across outcomes. All analyses were performed using Stata 15.1. Results: The results indicated that in contrast with the lowest level of PA, promoting the highest PA level lowers the risk of GDM by 36% (RR = 0.64, 95%CI: 0.53 ~ 0.78). We found a curvilinear dose–response association between PA during the first trimester and incident GDM (Pnonlinearity = 0.012). Compared to inactive pregnant women, for those who achieved the guidelines-suggested minimum level (10 MET-h/week) of PA during the first trimester, the GDM risk was decreased by 13% (RR = 0.87, 95%CI: 0.79 ~ 0.96). A linear relationship was found between PA during the second trimester and the GDM risk (Pnonlinearity = 0.276). The results with a restricted cubic spline model suggested that pregnant women who accumulate 10 MET-h/week have a 1% reduced risk of GDM compared to completely inactive individuals. Twice (20 MET-h/week) or a higher amount of PA (50 MET-h/week) contributed to further reductions in GDM risk. Conclusion: There is a dose–response relationship between higher levels of PA in both the first and second trimesters and reduced risk of GDM; the relationship is stronger in the first trimester. Increasing PA during pregnancy can prevent the development of GDM.

Methods: 144 patients who could undergo regular follow-up after ACL reconstruction were divided into 2 groups: those with greater than 90% (Group A: n = 95) and less than 85% (Group B: n = 49) isokinetic knee contraction at 60°/s 6 months post-ACL reconstruction. Basic information, injury status, limited preoperative knee extension, and knee extensor strength at 3 and 6 months postoperatively were compared between the groups. Multivariate logistic analysis was performed and included variables that showed statistically significant differences between the groups in the univariate analysis. In addition, the cut-off value for the limb symmetry index (LSI) at 3 months postoperatively needed to exceed an LSI of 90% at 6 months postoperatively was calculated using the receiver operating characteristics curve. Results: Age, preoperative waiting period, limited preoperative knee extension, and knee extensor strength at 3 months postoperatively were significantly different between the two groups. The multivariate logistic analysis showed that all the variables affected the improvement in knee extensor strength at 6 months postoperatively. Limited preoperative knee extension was the most significant factor (odds ratio: 15.1, 95% confidence interval: 2.57–118.56, p < 0.01). The LSI cut-off value at 3 months postoperatively was 72.0%. Conclusion: Key factors in achieving the necessary knee extensor strength criteria for return to sports at 6 months post-ACL reconstruction include addressing limited preoperative knee extension and achieving an LSI ≥ 72% in knee extensor strength at 3 months postoperatively.

We evaluated the relationship between lesion characteristics and the patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and compared this with symptoms reported by patients scheduled for knee ligament reconstruction and knee arthroplasty. Design: Preoperative data, including Lysholm score and The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), in 90 consecutive patients scheduled for surgery for symptomatic isolated cartilage lesions were prospectively collected. Result: The patients had a mean age of 33.2 years. There were 62 (69%) males. There was no statistically significant difference in PROMs between patients with cartilage lesions smaller or larger than 2 cm2, except for the KOOS subscale symptoms, with patients with smaller lesions reporting higher scores, 62.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 58.3-67.3) vs. 51.9 (95% CI 45.5-58.4), P = 0.005. There was a small correlation between lesion size and Lysholm score. However, when adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, and lesion localization, this effect was not statistically significant. The International Cartilage Regeneration & Joint Preservation Society grade did not affect preoperative PROMs. Cartilage patients reported worse preoperative symptoms than patients scheduled for knee ligament reconstruction, and approaching the symptoms reported by patients scheduled for knee arthroplasty. Conclusion: The size, depth, and location of cartilage lesions have little impact on the symptoms experienced by the patients. Cartilage patients have comparable symptoms to patients scheduled for knee arthroplasty. © The Author(s) 2022.",ACL; arthroscopy; articular cartilage injury; MPFL; PROM,"Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Cartilage, Articular; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Male; Pain; adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; arthroscopy; Article; articular cartilage; body mass; cartilage injury; controlled study; female; femoral condyle; human; knee arthroplasty; Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score; knee meniscus rupture; knee surgery; Lysholm score; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pain; patellofemoral joint; patient-reported outcome; prospective study; quality of life; questionnaire; visual analog scale; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; knee; knee injury; pain","""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Hip Arthroscopy Outcomes and Rehabilitation

However, these measures are rarely quantified in large-scale research studies or clinical practice due to the prohibitive cost, time, and expertise required. Here we present and validate OpenCap, an open-source platform for computing both the kinematics (i.e., motion) and dynamics (i.e., forces) of human movement using videos captured from two or more smartphones. OpenCap leverages pose estimation algorithms to identify body landmarks from videos; deep learning and biomechanical models to estimate three-dimensional kinematics; and physics-based simulations to estimate muscle activations and musculoskeletal dynamics. OpenCap’s web application enables users to collect synchronous videos and visualize movement data that is automatically processed in the cloud, thereby eliminating the need for specialized hardware, software, and expertise. We show that OpenCap accurately predicts dynamic measures, like muscle activations, joint loads, and joint moments, which can be used to screen for disease risk, evaluate intervention efficacy, assess between-group movement differences, and inform rehabilitation decisions. Additionally, we demonstrate OpenCap’s practical utility through a 100-subject field study, where a clinician using OpenCap estimated musculoskeletal dynamics 25 times faster than a laboratory-based approach at less than 1% of the cost. By democratizing access to human movement analysis, OpenCap can accelerate the incorporation of biomechanical metrics into large-scale research studies, clinical trials, and clinical practice. © 2023 Uhlrich et al.

While good psychometric properties have been demonstrated, the data lack cross-cultural validity, construct validity, and an established measurement error. Purpose: To (1) translate and cross-culturally adapt the BPII 2.0 to the Norwegian version (BPII 2.0–No) and (2) examine the psychometric properties of the Norwegian version. Study Design: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 3. Methods: The BPII 2.0 was translated according to international guidelines. A cohort of 100 patients surgically treated for recurrent patellofemoral instability completed the BPII 2.0–No, related outcome measures (Norwich Patellar Instability Score, International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form 2000, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia), and functional tests (Y-Balance Test–Lower Quarter, single-leg hop tests, and knee extension strength) before and/or 6 months after surgery. We evaluated the face and content validity, internal consistency (Cronbach α), test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]), measurement error (SEM and smallest detectable change at the individual [SDCind] and group levels [SDCgroup]). Construct validity was assessed by testing 9 hypotheses on the correlation between the BPII 2.0–No and the outcome measures/functional tests (Pearson r). Results: The BPII 2.0–No had good face and content validity. Internal consistency was excellent (α =.95), and no floor or ceiling effects were found. Test-retest reliability was high (ICC2,1 = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77-0.93), and measurement error was low (SEM = 7.1). The SDCind was 19.7 points and the SDCgroup was 2.8 points. Eight of the 9 hypotheses regarding construct validity were confirmed. Conclusion: The BPII 2.0–No was found to be valid and reliable. This study adds further knowledge on the measurement properties of the BPII 2.0 that can be used internationally. © The Author(s) 2023.",Banff Patellofemoral Instability Instrument 2.0; COSMIN; patellar instability; quality of life; reliability; validity,adult; Article; bone malformation; cohort analysis; content validity; Cross cultural Validation; female; human; knee function; knee injury; major clinical study; male; measurement error; muscle strength; osteoarthritis; patella dislocation; Patellofemoral Instability; phobia; prospective study; psychometry; quality of life; questionnaire,"""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Patellar Dislocation: Treatment and Rehabilitation Methods

This study investigated the occupational biomechanical and occupational psychosocial factors associated with neck pain intensity, neck disability and sick leave amongst construction labourers in an urban Nigerian population. Methods This cross-sectional study measured clinical neck pain outcomes, occupational biomechanical factors, and occupational psychosocial factors. Descriptive, and univariate/multivariate inferential statistical analyses were conducted. Results Significant independent factors associated with neck pain intensity were order and pace of tasks being dependent on others (β = 0.35; p<0.0001); inability to take breaks in addition to scheduled breaks (β = 0.25; p<0.0001); inability to work because of unexpected events (β = 0.21; p<0.0001); inability to control the order and pace of tasks (β = 0.20; p<0.0001); and weight of load (β = 0.17; p<0.0001); accounting for 53% of the variance in neck pain intensity. Significant independent factors associated with neck disability were weight of load (β = 0.30; p<0.0001); duration of load carriage (β = 0.16; p = 0.01); working under time pressure/ deadlines (β = 0.16; p = 0.02); and accounting for 20% of the variance in neck disability. Significant independent factor associated with sick leave was duration of load carriage (β = 0.15; p = 0.04), in a non-significant regression model explaining -4% of the variance in sick leave. Addition of pain intensity significantly explained more variance in neck disability 31.0%) but less variance in sick leave (-5%), which was not statistically significant (F (10, 190) = 0.902, p = 0.533). Conclusions Occupational biomechanical factors may be more important than occupational psychosocial factors in explaining neck disability and sick leave. In contrast, occupational psychosocial factors may be more important than occupational biomechanical factors in explaining neck pain intensity in this population in Nigeria. © 2024 Igwesi-Chidobe et al.

However, the traditional measures (i.e. non-fatigued state and by peak torque [PT]) may not reflect the thigh and knee injury conditions (i.e. high-speed actions and fatigue presence). We verified the effects of a high-speed isokinetic fatigue protocol (30 consecutive KF and KE concentric contractions at 300°/s) on KF and KE performance and H:Q ratios assessed through different parameters (i.e. PT, work, average and peak power) in male professional futsal players (n = 17). A significant (p < 0.01) time × muscle group interaction was verified. There were reductions (p < 0.01) in KF by PT (84.79 ± 15.05 to 50.29 ± 15.29 Nm), work (87.28 ± 14.46 to 39.00 ± 13.83 Nm), average power (227.81 ± 39.31 to 104.75 ± 31.24 W) and peak power (383.40 ± 59.90 to 191.39 ± 48.35 W). Similarly, KE performance decreased (p < 0.01) for all parameters (PT: 131.36 ± 16.05 to 81.61 ± 9.15 Nm; work: 148.83 ± 20.88 to 90.72 ± 11.89 Nm; average power: 148.83 ± 20.88 to 90.72 ± 11.89 W; peak power: 664.74 ± 85.32 to 398.38 ± 42.42 W).

This study evaluates PSI in individuals 4 weeks to 6 months post-mTBI using the BCTT ""failure"" criteria, and additional exploratory measures of test duration and heart rate (HR) response. Setting: Tertiary hospital and university. Participants: Participants included 73 individuals 4 weeks to 6 months post-mTBI and a comparison group of 39 healthy controls (HCs). The mTBI group was further subgrouped at screening into those considering themselves asymptomatic (Asymp mTBI) (n = 35) or symptomatic (Symp mTBI) (n = 36). Design: Observational cohort study. Main Measures: BCTT; failure rate (%), test duration (minutes), HR responses. Results:: Thirty percent of the mTBI group (including 50% of the Symp and 9% of the Asymp subgroups) failed the BCTT. BCTT duration and associated overall HR change was significantly lower in the mTBI group and Symp subgroup compared with HCs. Compared with HCs maximal HR percentage was higher for the first 4 minutes of the test in the mTBI group, and for the first 2 minutes of the test for the Symp subgroup. Conclusions: Individuals post-mTBI demonstrated PSI impairment subacutely. In some individuals this was despite an initially reported absence of symptoms. The study also showed some preliminary evidence that BCTT duration and HR responses may be additionally informative post-mTBI. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

According to the Laws of Thermodynamics and the CICO (Calories in, Calories out) model, increased exercise-induced energy expenditure (EE), in the absence of any compensatory increase in energy intake, should result in an energy deficit leading to reductions of body mass. However, the expected negative energy balance is met with both volitional and non-volitional (metabolic and behavioral) compensatory responses. A commonly reported compensatory response to exercise is increased food intake (i.e., Calories in) due to increased hunger, increased desire for certain foods, and/or changes in health beliefs. On the other side of the CICO model, exercise training can instigate compensatory reductions in EE that resist the maintenance of an energy deficit. This may be due to decreases in non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT), increases in sedentary behavior, or alterations in sleep. Related to this EE compensation, the motivational states associated with the desire to be active tend to be overlooked when considering compensatory changes in non-exercise activity. For example, exercise-induced alterations in the wanting of physical activity could be a mechanism promoting compensatory reductions in EE. Thus, one’s desires, urges or cravings for movement–also known as “motivation states” or “appetence for activity”-are thought to be proximal instigators of movement. Motivation states for activity may be influenced by genetic, metabolic, and psychological drives for activity (and inactivity), and such states are susceptible to fatigue-or reward-induced responses, which may account for reductions in NEAT in response to exercise training. Further, although the current data are limited, recent investigations have demonstrated that motivation states for physical activity are dampened by exercise and increase after periods of sedentarism. Collectively, this evidence points to additional compensatory mechanisms, associated with motivational states, by which impositions in exercise-induced changes in energy balance may be met with resistance, thus resulting in attenuated weight loss.

Although telerehabilitation is an increasingly used alternative for delivering therapeutic exercise, no studies have assessed synchronous group telerehabilitation interventions for the management of musculoskeletal disorders. Thus, the aim of this article is to describe the protocol of a randomized controlled trial that will assess the effects of a videoconference-based group therapeutic exercise intervention on the musculoskeletal pain of eldercare workers. Methods: This multicenter trial will randomly assign 130 eldercare workers to either a control or experimental group. Participants in the control group will not receive any intervention, and participants in the experimental group will take part in a 12-week remote supervised videoconference-based intervention, consisting of 2 weekly 45-min group sessions. Each session will include 4 sets of 6 progressive resistance exercises for the lower limbs, upper limbs and trunk, performed with bodyweight and elastic bands at moderate-high intensity. Following the 12 weeks, participants in the experimental group will be provided with material for autonomously carry on the therapeutic exercises and advised to continue performing 2 weekly sessions on their own until a 48-week follow-up. Assessments will be performed at baseline, 12 and 48 weeks. Primary outcome will be average pain intensity in the low back during the last 7 days, measured by the 0–10 Numerical Rating Scale. Secondary outcomes will include additional measures of musculoskeletal pain, psycho-affective state, work-related variables, and physical fitness. Discussion: This will be the first trial, to our knowledge, assessing whether a remote delivery of a group therapeutic exercise intervention via videoconference is effective for reducing the musculoskeletal pain, improving the psycho-affective state and physical fitness, and enhancing the work-related parameters in eldercare workers. If successful, this study will provide innovative tools for implementing effective, scalable and affordable interventions to tackle musculoskeletal disorders in the workplace. It will also highlight the utility of telehealth, and address the importance of therapeutic exercise to manage musculoskeletal pain in a critical population for the future of the aging societies as it is the eldercare workers.

A Propensity Score-Matched Analysis Including 238 Patients of the German Cartilage Registry (KnorpelRegister DGOU),2023,Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152738896&doi=10.1016%2fj.arthro.2023.02.024&partnerID=40&md5=58eb1048b603890f6d4e16388aaf1b2d,"Purpose: To determine whether bipolar lesions (BL) are associated with inferior clinical outcome following articular cartilage regeneration (CR) compared to unipolar lesions (UL). Methods: A registry-based study, including patients undergoing isolated CR for focal knee cartilage lesions was performed. Lesions were considered UL or BL depending on the opposing cartilage. Propensity score matching was applied to eliminate potential confounders. Two groups comprising 119 patients with similar baseline characteristics were matched. The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) at baseline, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months following CR served as primary outcome measure. KOOS improvement, reaching the minimal clinically important difference (MCID), KOOS subcomponents, and failure rates were calculated. Results: Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) was the most frequently performed procedure in both groups with 63.0% (BL) and 46.6% (UL). There was a significant difference regarding KOOS at 24 months between UL (76.39 ± 14.96) and BL (69.83 ± 18.83; P = .028), which did not exceed the threshold of MCID. No significant difference was detected at any other follow-up. KOOS improvement from baseline was lower in the BL group at all follow-ups and peaked at 36 months in both groups (UL [26.00 ± 16.12] vs. BL [16.63 ± 17.29]; P = .024). The failure rate in the BL group was higher at 8.2% (9/110) compared to the UL group at 3.9% (4/98) (P = .256). Conclusions: BL were associated with worse clinical outcome 2 years following CR compared to UL. However, both groups showed an ongoing clinical improvement up to 3 years postoperatively and a low failure rate. While inferior clinical improvement and a lower clinical response rate may be expected in BL patients, the observed differences do not justify excluding these patients from CR.

Purpose: To assess the rate of further ACL injury in patients who have undergone ACLR with hamstring tendon autograft after soccer injuries in Australia and to determine factors associated with repeat ACL injury and return to soccer. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: From a prospectively collected database, a series of 1000 consecutive ACLRs using hamstring autografts performed in soccer players were identified. Patients were surveyed at a minimum 5 years after reconstruction, including details of further ACL injuries to either knee, return to soccer or other sports, and psychological readiness per the Anterior Cruciate Ligament Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) scale. Results: Of the 862 participants reviewed, ACL graft rupture occurred in 85 (10%) and contralateral ACL rupture in 68 (8%) within 5 years after the reconstruction. The 5-year ACL graft survivorship was 94% for females and 88% for males. The survivorship of the contralateral ACL was 92% for males and 90% for females. When compared with those aged >25 years, the odds of ACL graft rupture was increased by 4 to 5 times in those aged 19 to 25 years and 3 to 7 times in those ≤18 years. Further ACL injury to the graft or contralateral knee occurred in 44% of males aged ≤18 years. Risk factors for further ACL injury were younger age at time of surgery, male sex, and return to soccer. Graft diameter did not influence ACL graft rupture rates, and 70% of patients returned to soccer after ACLR. The mean ACL-RSI score was 59, and patients who reported more fear of reinjury on this scale were less likely to have returned to soccer. Conclusion: The prevalence of ACL graft rupture (10%) and contralateral ACL rupture (8%) was near equivalent over 5 years in this large cohort of mostly recreational Australian soccer players. ACLR with hamstring autograft is a reliable procedure, allowing 70% of patients to return to soccer in this high-risk population. Risk factors for further ACL injury are progressively younger age at time of surgery, male sex, and return to soccer. Graft diameter was not a factor in ACL graft rupture, indicating that other factors, particularly age, are of primary importance. © 2022 The Author(s).",ACL graft rupture; ACL reconstruction; anterior cruciate ligament; reinjury; soccer,Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Australia; Autografts; Case-Control Studies; Female; Hamstring Tendons; Humans; Male; Return to Sport; Soccer; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Australia; autograft; case control study; female; hamstring tendon; human; male; procedures; return to sport; soccer; transplantation,"""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction and Outcome Factors

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify parent-perceived facilitators and barriers to health for toddlers (12–36 months old) with Down syndrome. Materials and methods: We conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with the mothers of 25 toddlers with Down syndrome. All interviews were conducted using Zoom Video Technology, audio recorded and transcribed before being coded in NVivo software using a structured protocol. Thematic analysis was used to identify themes in perceived facilitators and barriers to health at the level of the child, family, and community. Data were triangulated using reflective journaling, video review of child meals, and member-checking techniques. Results: We identified unique themes for facilitators (on the move and sound sleep) and barriers (co-occurring conditions and eating behaviors) at the level of the child. At the level of the family and community, overarching themes that were viewed as either a facilitator or barrier, depending on the context, were identified (role models matter, time is critical, the importance of place, and social support). Conclusion: These themes can help clinicians and researchers tailor their health promotion interventions to meet the unique needs of children with Down syndrome by using strength-based approaches and providing families with the tools to overcome barriers. 2023 Caldwell, Kim, Alshahwan, Vellody, Bendixen, Renz, Duong, Dodd, Terhorst and Must.",Down syndrome; early childhood; health; obesity; thematic analysis; toddler,Article; audio recording; child; child health; clinical article; community; Down syndrome; family; feeding behavior; female; habit; human; male; meal; mother; perception; preschool child; qualitative research; semi structured interview; sleep; social support; software; thematic analysis; time factor; toddler; videorecording,"""Physical Activity Interventions and Motor Competence in Children with Disabilities""",Motor Skills Development and Intervention in Children with Disabilities,Physical Fitness in Children and Adolescents

Methods: An insurance database was used to determine all patients who underwent shoulder arthroscopy for a 5-year period with an associated preoperative ipsilateral corticosteroid injection. Patients were stratified into cohorts based on timing of preoperative CSI: (1) 0-<2 weeks, (2) 2-<4 weeks, (3) 4-<6 weeks, and (4) 6-<8 weeks. Patients were pooled to include all patients who had a CSI less than 4 weeks and those longer than 4 weeks. A cohort of patients who never had a corticosteroid injection before undergoing arthroscopy were used as a control. All patients had a follow-up of 2 years. Multivariable regression analyses were performed using R Studio with significance defined as P < .05. Results: Multivariate logistic regression showed a greater odds ratio (OR) for postoperative infection in patients who received CSI 0-<2 weeks before shoulder arthroscopy at 90 days (3.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.62-5.57, P < .001), 1 year (2.51, 95% CI 1.46-4.12, P < .001), and 2 years (2.08, 95% CI 1.27-3.28, P = .002) compared with the control group. Patients who received CSI 2-<4 weeks before shoulder arthroscopy had greater OR for infection at 90 days (2.26, 95% CI 1.28-3.83, P = .03), 1 year (1.82, 95% CI 1.13-2,82, P = .01), and 2 years (1.62, 95% CI 1.10-2.47, P = .012). Patients who received CSI after 4 weeks had similar ORs of infection at 90 days (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.78-1.69, P = .48) 1 year (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.85-1.63 P = .33), and 2 years (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.83-1.42, P = .54), compared with the control cohort. Conclusions: The present study shows the postoperative infection risk is greatest when CSIs are given within 2 weeks of shoulder arthroscopy, whereas CSIs given within 2-<4 weeks also portend increased risk, albeit to a lesser degree. The risk of postoperative infection is not significantly increased when CSIs are given more than 1 month before surgery.

Methods: All MPFL reconstruction performed between 2017 and 2019 were reviewed retrospectively. Only patients with isolated MPFL reconstruction, without any major patellofemoral risk factors and a minimum follow-up of 24 months, were included in the study. Patients were matched with respect to sex, age, and body mass index. All patients were evaluated clinically and using PROMs. Results: A total of 64 patients with an average follow up of 28.7 ± 7.5 months were included in this study. The mean Kujala score (GT: 84.8 ± 12.9, QT: 88.9 ± 10.1), Lysholm score (GT: 89.4 ± 10.2, QT: 88.4 ± 5.0), and visual analog scale score for pain (GT: 1.9 ± 1.8, QT: 1.1 ± 1.3) did not significantly differ between both groups. Tegner activity level was significantly greater (P = .027) in the QT group (5.5 ± 1.9) compared with the GT group (4.6 ± 1.8), but within the minimal clinically important differences. Occasional patellar instability events, but no recurrent dislocation, were reported in 12.5% in the GT group and 6.3% in the QT group (P = .39). Of all patients, 90.6% in the QT and 68.8% in the HT group exceeded the PASS for the Kujala score (P = .06). Significantly more patients (59.4%) treated with GT reported donor-site morbidity in the form of sensitivity deficit at the lower leg compared with those treated with QT (3.1%, P = .001). Conclusions: GT and QT MPFL reconstruction have comparable PROMs and patellar redislocation rates 2 years’ postoperatively.

Aim: This study was designed to evaluate the potential influence of a multimodal exercise program on the health-related physical fitness and quality of life of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma during radiotherapy. Methods: Forty patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma undergoing radiotherapy in the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University from May to November 2019 were included. The participants in the control group (N=20) received routine nursing, while those in the intervention group (N=20) were also subjected to the multimodal exercise program during radiotherapy. Results: The multimodal exercise program had a positive effect on participants. The step test index in the intervention group was significantly higher as compared to the control group (p < .05). The participants were subjected to 5 times slow speed (60°/s) and 10 times fast (180°/s) speed, and function of some extensor and flexor muscles of the elbow, shoulder, and knee joints in the intervention group was markedly improved (p < .05). In the intervention group, the grip strength of the right hand was observed to be significantly improved (p < .01). Furthermore, the upper limb scratch dorsal test of intervention group was significantly better than that of the control group (p < .05). The scores of physical, emotional, and social functions in the intervention group were found to be significantly higher as compared to the control group (p < .05). Conclusions: The multimodal exercise program significantly improved the health-related physical fitness and life quality of the patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma during radiotherapy, though its long-term effects remain to be further analyzed. © 2023",,Exercise; Humans; Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma; Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms; Physical Fitness; Quality of Life; exercise; fitness; human; nasopharynx carcinoma; nasopharynx tumor; physiology; psychology; quality of life,"""Physical Activity, Rehabilitation, and Health Outcomes in Medical Conditions""",Impact of Exercise and Rehabilitation on Quality of Life and Health in Patients,Exercise Programs and Physical Activity in Cancer Recovery

Arthroscopic-assisted percutaneous fixation (AAPF) has been introduced as an alternative to traditional open reduction internal fixation (ORIF). The purpose of the study is to compare clinical and radiographic outcomes in patients with low-energy Schatzker type I–III tibial plateau fractures treated with AAPF versus ORIF. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed at a level 1 trauma centre to compare outcomes of 120 patients (57 AAPF, 63 ORIF) with low-energy lateral Schatzker type I–III tibial plateau fractures who underwent tibial plateau fixation between 2009 and 2018. Demographic information, injury characteristics, and surgical treatment were recorded. The main outcome measurements included reduction step-off, joint space narrowing, time to weight bearing, and implant removal. Results: There was no difference in age, gender distribution, BMI, ASA, Schatzker classification distribution, initial displacement, blood loss, and reduction step-off between the two groups (p > 0.05). Shorter tourniquet time (74.1 ± 21.7 vs 100.0 ± 21.0 min; p < 0.001), shorter time to full weight bearing (47.8 ± 15.2 vs. 69.1 ± 17.2 days; p < 0.001), and lower rate of joint space narrowing (3.5% vs. 28.6% with more than 1 mm, p < 0.001) were associated with the AAPF cohort, with no difference in pain, knee range of motion, or implant removal rate between the two cohorts. Conclusion: AAPF may be a viable alternative to ORIF for the management of low-energy tibial plateau fractures with outcomes not inferior compared to the traditional ORIF method. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to SICOT aisbl.",Arthroscopic-assisted; Arthroscopic-assisted tibial plateau; Percutaneous fixation; Tibial plateau fracture,"Fracture Fixation, Internal; Humans; Open Fracture Reduction; Retrospective Studies; Tibial Fractures; Tibial Plateau Fractures; Treatment Outcome; calcium phosphate; adult; age distribution; American Society of Anaesthesiologists score; arthropathy; arthroscopic assisted percutaneous fixation; arthroscopic surgery; Article; body mass; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; comparative effectiveness; device removal; disease classification; female; fluoroscopy; follow up; fracture dislocation; fracture fixation; full weight bearing; human; intermethod comparison; joint space narrowing; knee arthroscopy; knee function; knee pain; knee radiography; lateral tibial plateau fracture; major clinical study; male; medical record review; middle aged; open fracture reduction; open reduction internal fixation; operative blood loss; osteosynthesis; range of motion; retrospective study; Schatzker classification; sex ratio; tibial plateau fracture; time; tourniquet time; visual analog scale; diagnostic imaging; open fracture reduction; osteosynthesis; procedures; tibia fracture; tibial plateau fracture; treatment outcome","""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Shoulder Surgery Outcomes and Measures

This study investigated the effect of NMES applied for 12 weeks to the quadriceps muscles of female nursing-home residents aged 75 + on their functional capability and inflammatory, bone metabolism, and cardiovascular traits. Methods: Nineteen women regularly taking part in two body conditioning sessions per week were randomized into an electrical stimulation group (ES; n = 10; 30 min sessions, 3 times per week) or a control group (CON; n = 9). At baseline and study week 12, all women performed the 30 s chair stand test (30sCST), the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), and the instrumented timed up and go test (iTUG). Resting heart rates, blood pressure, and the blood concentrations of inflammatory and bone metabolism markers were also measured twice. Results: NMES increased the strength of participants’ quadriceps muscles and their performance on the 30sCST and 6MWT while lowering resting arterial blood pressure and inflammatory marker levels; osteoclast activity showed a tendency to decrease. Changes in the iTUG results were not observed. A multiple regression analysis found that the results of functional tests in the ES group were best correlated with pulse pressure (the 30sCST and iTUG tests) and diastolic blood pressure (the 6MWT test). Conclusion: Twelve weeks of NMES treatment improved participants’ functional capacity and inflammatory, bone metabolism, and cardiovascular traits. The ES group participants’ performance on functional tests was best predicted by hemodynamic parameters. © The Author(s) 2023.",Aged women; Functional capability; Neuromuscular electrical stimulation; Physio-biochemical traits; Quadriceps muscles strength,"Aged, 80 and over; Electric Stimulation; Electric Stimulation Therapy; Female; Humans; Muscle Strength; Pilot Projects; Postural Balance; Quadriceps Muscle; Time and Motion Studies; body equilibrium; controlled study; electrostimulation; electrotherapy; female; human; muscle strength; physiology; pilot study; procedures; quadriceps femoris muscle; randomized controlled trial; task performance; very elderly","""Effects of Different Therapeutic Interventions on Muscular and Neural Health""",Muscle Rehabilitation and Training Effects in Injury Recovery,Spinal Cord Injury and Exercise Rehabilitation

MCI affects an estimated 15% to 20% of people older than 65 years. Nonpharmacological interventions including exercise are recommended as part of overall MCI management based on the positive effects of exercise on cognitive performance. Interval training involves brief intermittent bouts of exercise interspersed with short recovery periods. This type of exercise promotes cognitive improvement and can be performed in individuals with MCI. Synaptic plasticity can be assessed in vivo by the neurophysiological response to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). A method to assess synaptic plasticity uses an intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS), which is a patterned form of rTMS. Individuals with MCI have decreased responses to iTBS, reflecting reduced synaptic plasticity. It is unknown whether interval training causes changes in synaptic plasticity in individuals living with MCI. Objective: This research will determine whether interval training performed using a cycle ergometer enhances synaptic plasticity in individuals with MCI. The three aims are to (1) quantify synaptic plasticity after interval training performed at a self-determined intensity in individuals with MCI; (2) determine whether changes in synaptic plasticity correlate with changes in serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor, osteocalcin, and cognition; and (3) assess participant compliance to the exercise schedule. Methods: 24 individuals diagnosed with MCI will be recruited for assignment to 1 of the 2 equally sized groups: exercise and no exercise. The exercise group will perform exercise 3 times per week for 4 weeks. Synaptic plasticity will be measured before and following the 4-week intervention. At these time points, synaptic plasticity will be measured as the response to single-pulse TMS, reflected as the percent change in the average amplitude of 20 motor-evoked potentials before and after an iTBS rTMS protocol, which is used to induce synaptic plasticity. In addition, individuals will complete a battery of cognitive assessments and provide a blood sample from the antecubital vein to determine serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor and osteocalcin. Results: The study began in September 2023. Conclusions: The proposed research is the first to assess whether synaptic plasticity is enhanced after exercise training in individuals with MCI. If exercise does indeed modify synaptic plasticity, this will create a new avenue by which we can study and manipulate neural plasticity in these individuals. ©Karishma R Ramdeo, Margaret Fahnestock, Martin Gibala, Ponnambalam Ravi Selvaganapathy, Justin Lee, Aimee Jennifer Nelson.",ageing; aging; brain; brain plasticity; brain-derived neurotrophic factor; cognition; cognitive; endocrinology; exercise; fitness; geriatric; gerontology; hormone; hormones; intermittent theta-burst stimulation; interval training; magnetic stimulation; mild cognitive impairment; neurology; neuroscience; neurotrophic; physical activity; plasticity; repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; synapse; synaptic; transcranial magnetic stimulation,,"""Cognitive Decline Prevention and Improvement through Exercise and Therapeutic Interventions""",Exercise Interventions and Cognitive Function in Older Adults,Exercise and Cognitive Function in Aging Adults

In this study, we investigated the effects of 3-dimensional image-based (3-D) insole in healthy volunteers with no foot diseases. Additionally, the comfort of the 3-D insole was compared with that of a custom-molded insole. A single-center, randomized, open clinical trial was conducted to address the effectiveness of insole use in a healthy population with no foot or knee disease. Two types of arch support insoles were evaluated for their effectiveness: a 3-D insole and a custom-molded insole. Fifty Korean volunteers participated in the study and were randomly allocated into the “3-D insole” (n = 40) or “custom-molding insole” (n = 10) groups. All subjects wore 3-D insoles or custom-molded insoles for 2 weeks. The sense of wearing shoes (Visual Analog Scale [VAS] and score) and fatigue of the foot were used to assess the insole effects at the end of the 2-week study period.

In the present study, rates of integrated myofibrillar protein synthesis (iMyoPS) were measured over 48-h prior-to and following a 45-min treadmill walk in 10 older-obese (O-OB, body fat[%]: 33 ± 3%), 10 older-non-obese (O-NO, 20 ± 3%), and 15 younger-non-obese (Y-NO, 13 ± 5%) individuals. Surface electromyography was used to determine thigh muscle “activation”. Quadriceps cross-sectional area (CSA), volume, and intramuscular thigh fat fraction (ITFF) were measured by magnetic resonance imaging. Quadriceps maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) was measured by dynamometry. Quadriceps CSA and volume were greater (muscle volume, Y-NO: 1182 ± 232 cm3; O-NO: 869 ± 155 cm3; O-OB: 881 ± 212 cm3, P < 0.01) and ITFF significantly lower (m. vastus lateralis, Y-NO: 3.0 ± 1.0%; O-NO: 4.0 ± 0.9%; O-OB: 9.1 ± 2.6%, P ≤ 0.03) in Y-NO compared with O-NO and O-OB, with no difference between O-NO and O-OB in quadriceps CSA and volume. ITFF was significantly higher in O-OB compared with O-NO. Relative MVC was lower in O-OB compared with Y-NO and O-NO (Y-NO: 5.5 ± 1.6 n·m/kg−1; O-NO: 3.9 ± 1.0 n·m/kg−1; O-OB: 2.9 ± 1.1 n·m/kg−1, P < 0.0001). Thigh muscle “activation” during the treadmill walk was greater in O-OB compared with Y-NO and O-NO (Y-NO: 30.5 ± 13.5%; O-NO: 35.8 ± 19.7%; O-OB: 68.3 ± 32.3%, P < 0.01). Habitual iMyoPS did not differ between groups, whereas iMyoPS was significantly elevated over 48-h post-walk in O-OB (+ 38.6 ± 1.2%·day−1, P < 0.01) but not Y-NO or O-NO (+ 11.4 ± 1.1%·day−1 and + 17.1 ± 1.1%·day−1, respectively, both P > 0.271). Equivalent muscle mass in O-OB may be explained by the muscle anabolic response to weight-bearing activity, whereas the age-related decline in indices of muscle quality appears to be exacerbated in O-OB and warrants further exploration. © 2023, The Author(s).",Fat mass; Intramuscular fat; Muscle mass; Muscle protein synthesis; Muscle quality; Obesity,,"""Effects of Different Factors on Muscle Performance and Metabolism""",Exercise and Muscle Performance in Different Individuals,Spinal Cord Injury and Exercise Rehabilitation

Whether virtual reality (VR) exergames are also appropriate and make a positive contribution to the reduction of BP has not yet been sufficiently investigated. Therefore, the aim of the study was to gain knowledge of the load intensities to be achieved during a VR exergame and to examine the short-term effects on BP. Methods: For the preliminary study, 22 participants with hypertension over the age of 65 years were analyzed. The study took place in a mobile laboratory truck. All participants visited on two occasions. During visit 1, VR strength endurance training (VR-SET) and during visit 2, VR endurance training (VR-ET) was performed. Each VR session lasted approximately 25 min and was of a moderate intensity. Heart rate (HR) was measured across the entire session, as well as BP before and after the VR exergame. The Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) and task load using NASA Task Load Index were determined after each VR session. Included in the statistical analysis were the Shapiro–Wilk test, the paired t-test, the Wilcoxon test and ANOVA for repeated measures. Results: During the “main part” (p <.001), at the “end” (p =.002) and for the “maximum HR” (p <.001), significant load differences between both VR sessions could be determined. In addition, significantly more participants in the VR-SET group achieved a moderate load intensity of at least 40% of heart rate reserve (p =.014). Regarding RPE, participants rated their subjectively perceived exertion significantly higher in the VR-SET than in the VR-ET (p =.028). Systolic BP decreased significantly in both VR sessions when compared before VR session and 5 min after VR session (p =.015; p =.003), as well as before VR session and 10 min after VR session (p =.018; p <.001). Conclusions: An individual moderate load intensity of 40% can be reached during VR-SET. In addition, a positive short-term effect of the VR exergame on BP behavior (postexercise hypotension) was observed after both VR sessions. The preliminary results indicate that a VR exergaming could lead to blood pressure lowering effects for older people with hypertension.

Physical activity is a key component of burn rehabilitation programs. Yet, not all burn survivors exercise at the recommended level. This is an exploratory study examining the association of the demographics and injury characteristics of burn survivors with a fear of movement. The subjective fear of movement was measured using the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK). The TSK score was compared between several demographics and injury characteristics by performing the independent sample t-test. Sixty-six percent of subjects in our study (n = 35), reported high levels of kinesiophobia (score 37 or above). The mean scores of the TSK were greater in males (40.7), non-white (43.0), Hispanic/Latino (41.1), age greater than 50 years (42.3), and TBSA burn of >15% compared to females (36.9), white (38.5), non-Hispanic/Latino (39.3), age 50 years or less (38.1), and TBSA 15% or less (39.4), respectively. However, with the exception of time postinjury, none of the mean differences were statistically significant. Subjects who had sustained a burn injury more than 12 months ago showed higher levels of kinesiophobia than the subjects who were injured within 12 months with a mean difference of 7.35 (P =. 01). Thus, this study highlights the importance of 1) continued, long-term follow-up for burn survivors, and 2) appropriate educational and treatment interventions to address any underlying existing, new, or emerging medical issues that may contribute to the fear or avoidance of movement.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Design: Sequential explanatory, mixed methods study. Setting: 21 hospital sites across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Participants: Adults with a clinical diagnosis of first/recurrent stroke or TIA. Patients approaching end of life were excluded. Participants were recruited as in-patients or at first clinic appointment and a baseline questionnaire was completed. A 6-month follow-up questionnaire was sent to participants for self-completion. Open-text questions were asked about barriers and facilitators when returning to, or participating in, leisure activity. Responses were thematically analysed and explored by participant characteristics, including type of leisure activity undertaken. Characteristics also included measures of socioeconomic deprivation, mood, fatigue and disability. Results: 2000 participants returned a 6-month follow-up questionnaire (78% stroke, 22% TIA); 1045 participants responded to a question on barriers and 820 on facilitators. Twelve themes were identified and the proportion of responses were reported (%). Barriers: physical difficulties (69%), lower energy levels (17%), loss of independence (11%), psychological difficulties (10%), hidden disabilities (7%), and delay or lack of healthcare provision (3%). Facilitators: family support (35%), healthcare support (27%), well-being and fitness (22%), friendship support (20%), self-management (19%), and returning to normality (9%). ‘Physical difficulties’ was the most reported barrier across all participant characteristics and activity types. Family support was the most reported facilitator except for those with greater disability, where it was healthcare support and those without fatigue where it was well-being and exercise. Conclusions: Physical difficulties and lack of energy are problematic for stroke and TIA survivors who want to return to or participate in leisure activity. Healthcare support alone cannot overcome all practical and emotional issues related to leisure activity engagement. Family support and improving well-being are important facilitators and future research should explore these mechanisms further. © 2022 by the authors.",engagement; leisure activity; qualitative; stroke; TIA,England; Northern Ireland; United Kingdom; Wales; disability; health care; health services; hospital sector; leisure industry; qualitative analysis; stroke; adult; aged; Article; cerebrovascular accident; disability; fatigue; female; human; leisure; major clinical study; male; mood; recurrent disease; socioeconomics; transient ischemic attack,"""Physical Activity and Rehabilitation in Adults with Neurological Conditions""",Physical Activity and Rehabilitation Post-Injury,Physical Activity Engagement Barriers and Facilitators for Stroke Survivors

Playing a brass instrument requires, besides many other skills, a controlled air stream to generate the necessary air pressures. On the trumpet, high intraoral pressures are needed, especially during high and loud notes. Therefore, it is not uncommon in trumpet pedagogy to teach that the use of breathing training devices enhances physical strength so that the required pressures can be produced with less effort. However, to date, no systematic assessment of the use of breathing training devices among trumpet players exists and their effect on playing performance is still unclear. METHODS: In this a pre-post, within-subject repeated measure study, we investigated the influence of a 5-week expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) upon trumpet performance. Twenty-four male professional trumpet players were allocated to either a control or intervention group. The intervention group (n =13) trained with an EMST device against a set resistance of 55% of their maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) for 5 weeks on 5 days per week. The control group (n =11) did no intervention. All participants underwent the same measures (MEP and rate of perceived exertion [RPE]) and played the same tasks (maximum long note, maximum high note, maximum dynamics and phrasing in high register) prior to and after the 5 weeks. RESULTS: After EMST, MEP increased significantly (13%, p = 0.049) in the intervention group, whereas no significant change was found in the control group. Performance parameters did not change in either of the groups, also after EMST. Despite the increase in MEP, we found no evidence that EMST has an influence on trumpet performance. CONCLUSION: We conclude that EMST seems unnecessary for the enhancement of trumpet playing, at least in a population of male professionals who already demonstrate excellent respiratory condition and control.

A French multicenter retrospective study,2023,Orthopaedics and Traumatology: Surgery and Research,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146063233&doi=10.1016%2fj.otsr.2022.103530&partnerID=40&md5=aec178fccecfd90af8a8b48b2a92185e,"Background: Medial patello-femoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction is one of the therapeutic options to treat patellofemoral instability. Classically, a à la carte treatment of skeletal and ligament abnormalities is described. This option is difficult to achieve in children because bony procedures can damage the femoral and/or tibial growth plate. The objective was to evaluate a strategy for isolated reconstruction of the MPFL in the treatment of objective patellar instabilities in children, in a large cohort. The return to sport, knee function and pain or discomfort were studied as secondary endpoints. Methods: This French multicenter retrospective study included 54 pediatric patients with objective patellofemoral instability. Patients were included if they had presented at least 2 episodes of objective patella dislocation. A Deie-like technique with gracilis tendon graft, soft tissue femoral fixation and patellar bone tunnels for patellar fixation was used. Recurrence of dislocation was studied as the primary endpoint, and the recurrence rate was compared with the literature. A comparison of functional scores (Kujala, Lille femoro-patellar instability score or LFPI Score and Tegner activity score) and NRS between pre- and postoperative was studied as a secondary objective. Results: A recurrence of femoro-patellar instability was observed for five patients within 2 years follow up (9%). A significant improvement of the Kujala, LFPI score, Tegner and NRS scores was observed (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Isolated reconstruction of the MPFL presents a risk of recurrence of 9% at 2 years follow-up. This technique significantly improves the functional scores of the knee. This modified Deie technique provides good clinical and functional results, allowing return to sports with an acceptable risk of recurrence of patellar dislocation, similar to those observed in the literature. Isolated MPFL reconstruction as a first-line treatment appears to be a reliable and effective technique in terms of recurrence of dislocation and functional scores. It allows early recovery and rehabilitation and has lower morbidity than procedures requiring bone gestures.

The purpose of this study was to analyse the prevalence of self-reported physical symptoms including eye-related problems in PGs. A further aim was to analyse the association between physical symptoms and lifestyle factors such as sleep time, play time and physical activity. Methods: This study was designed as a cross-sectional study with data based on an electronic survey, created specifically for this study, through discussion and screening of established validated questionnaires for physical symptoms in musculoskeletal conditions: the Karolinska Sleep Questionnaire and the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire. The survey comprised age and years of experience as a PG as descriptive variables, as well as questions on sleep, play time, physical activity and physical symptoms for the purpose of analysis. The directors of 10 professional gaming corporations were contacted by email with a link to the study-specific survey to distribute to all employees. Results: A total of 40 answers to the electronic survey were retrieved from 40 PGs, of which 62.5% (n = 25) had experienced at least one physical symptom in the three months prior to answering the survey. There was a significant association between playing time and physical symptoms (OR = 8.0; 95% CI 1.4–44.6, p = 0.018), where playing for more than 35 h a week was positively associated with eight times higher odds of experiencing physical symptoms. Conclusion: There is a high prevalence of physical symptoms, such as headache and eye symptoms, in professional eSports gamers. There was an association between playing more than 35 h per week with the prevalence of physical symptoms. © 2024, The Author(s).",Computer; Electronic sports; Gaming; Symptoms,adult; Article; body regions; cross-sectional study; electronic sport; exercise; experience; eye; headache; health survey; human; major clinical study; multiple choice test; Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire; pain; physical activity; sleep questionnaire; sleep time; sport; wake up time,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Injury Risk and Performance in Athletes

This study assessed changes and determined relationships between sensor-derived running biomechanics and core temperature among runners across an 11.27-km road race. Hypothesis: Core temperatures would increase significantly across the race, related to changes in spatiotemporal biomechanical measures. Study Design: Cross-sectional cohort study. Level of Evidence: Level 3. Methods: Twenty runners (9 female, 11 male; age, 48 ± 12 years; height, 169.7 ± 9.1 cm; mass, 71.3 ± 13.4 kg) enrolled in the 2022 Falmouth Road Race were recruited. Participants used lightweight technologies (ingestible thermistors and wearable sensors) to monitor core temperature and running biomechanics throughout the race. Timestamps were used to align sensor-derived measures for 7 race segments. Observations were labeled as core temperatures generally within normal limits (<38°C) or at elevated core temperatures (≥38°C). Multivariate repeated measures analyses of variance were used to assess changes in sensor-derived measures across the race, with Bonferroni post hoc comparisons for significant findings. Pearson’s r correlations were used to assess the relationship between running biomechanics and core temperature measures. Results: Eighteen participants developed hyperthermic core temperatures (39.0°C ± 0.5°C); core temperatures increased significantly across the race (P < 0.01). Kinetic measures obtained from the accelerometers, including shock, impact, and braking g, all significantly increased across the race (P < 0.01); other sensor-derived biomechanical measures did not change significantly. Core temperatures were weakly associated with biomechanics (|r range|, 0.02-0.16). Conclusion: Core temperatures and kinetics increased significantly across a race, yet these outcomes were not strongly correlated. The observed kinetic changes may have been attributed to fatigue-related influences over the race. Clinical Relevance: Clinicians may not expect changes in biomechanical movement patterns to signal thermal responses during outdoor running in a singular event. © 2024 The Author(s).",environmental stress; ingestible thermistor; loading; performance; weather,,"""Analysis of Biomechanics, Exercise Techniques, and Physiological Adaptations in Various Physical Activities""",Lower Limb Muscle Strength and Biomechanics Studies,Physiological and Biomechanical Responses in Sports Performance

PA is essential for maintaining cardiopulmonary function assessed by peak oxygen uptake. Since peak oxygen uptake represents the best predictor for mortality and morbidity in children with congenital heart disease the impact of lockdowns on this parameter is vital. Methods We evaluated retrospectively cardiopulmonary exercise data from our patient collective from before lockdown with twin-paired data from during lockdown. The twin-pairing was achieved by matching patients with similar heart disease, age, sex, and test method. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing was achieved on either the treadmill or the bicycle. Results We were able to twin-pair 90 cases (26 twins with heart disease and 19 healthy twins). There was a significant decrease of cardiopulmonary function (V?O 2peak: 35.7±9.8 vs.30.4±10.6) in the heart disease cohort along with a significant decrease in peak oxygen pulse (13.3±4.1 vs. 11.4±4.5), and peak minute ventilation (V ?E: 83.05±29.08 vs.71,49±24.96). The healthy children improved over the timeframe, but this only reached significance for peak minute ventilation (81.72±25.79 vs.97.94±31.4). Conclusion We observed a significant decline of peak oxygen uptake during lockdown in the group of congenital heart disease (CHD) patients. This involved a loss of cardiac function as well as pulmonary function. This could be explained by limited access to sports facilities and restriction of regular daily movement due to school closure and overprotection. Healthy children improved their pulmonary function. This might be an indication of an improvement of exercise during confinement. © 2023 Georg Thieme Verlag.

The participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups: control (CG), supplement (SG), training (TG), or training plus supplement (TSG). The intervention involved daily administration of either spirulina or a placebo and HIIT three times a week for the training groups. Anthropometric indices, HOMA-IR, VO2peak, and circulating adipokines (asprosin and lipocalin2, omentin-1, irisin, and spexin) were measured before and after the 12-week intervention. Post-intervention analysis indicated differences between the CG and the three interventional groups for body weight, fat-free mass (FFM), percent body fat (%BF), HOMA-IR, and adipokine levels (p < 0.05). TG and SG participants had increased VO2peak (p < 0.05). Spirulina supplementation with HIIT increased VO2peak, omentin-1, irisin, and spexin, while causing decreases in lipocalin-2 and asprosin levels and improvements in body composition (weight, %fat), BMI, and HOMA-IR. Notably, the combination of spirulina and HIIT produced more significant changes in circulating adipokines and cardiometabolic health in obese males compared to either supplementation or HIIT alone (p < 0.05).

Methods: A two-phase modified Delphi study was conducted. Phase 1 involved a survey with suggested criteria and diagrams to define various stages of articular cartilage repair and phase 2 involved an expert consensus meeting that discussed the survey responses and voted on final scoring criteria. The survey was emailed to members of the Canadian Hip Preservation Research Collaborative (CHIPR) and respondents included both board certified orthopedic surgeons as well as musculoskeletal radiologists. Results: Overall, there were 17 survey respondents from Canada and most (47%, 8/17) participants agreed that the minimum MRI protocol needed to evaluate cartilage repair was a 3.0 T MRI and 94% (17/18) agreed that the minimum time post-operatively that they felt they would be able to accurately evaluate cartilage repair on an MRI was 12 months. Following phases 1 and 2, the final Magnetic Resonance Evaluation of the Repair of Cartilage in the Hip (MERCH) score was developed with 7 domains, 3 criteria per domain: 1) volume fill of cartilage defect, 2) integration into adjacent cartilage, 3) surface of the repair tissue, 4) structure of the repair tissue, 5) bony overgrowth, 6) subchondral changes, and 7) delamination. The score ranges from 60 (optimal) to -20 points (worst/none). Conclusions: This consensus project established a new MRI scoring system to evaluate post-operative cartilage restoration of the hip. The implementation of the MERCH score is essential in our ability to guide patient management and expectations in a rapidly evolving field and will help with standardizing our evaluation of cartilage repair in future research trials.

In addition to tensile loads, it is believed that the Achilles tendon may also be exposed to compressive loads. However, data on intratendinous pressures are lacking, and consequently, their role in the pathophysiology of tendinopathy is still under debate. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the intratendinous pressure changes in the Achilles tendon during stretching and eccentric loading. Twelve pairs of human cadaveric legs were mounted in a testing rig, and a miniature pressure catheter was placed through ultrasound-guided insertion in four different regions of the Achilles tendon: the insertion (superficial and deep layers), mid-portion, and proximal portion. Intratendinous pressure was measured during three simulated loading conditions: a bent-knee calf stretch, a straight-knee calf stretch, and an eccentric heel-drop. It was found that the intratendinous pressure increased exponentially in both the insertion and mid-portion regions of the Achilles tendon during each loading condition (p < 0.001). The highest pressures were consistently found in the deep insertion region (p < 0.001) and during the eccentric heel-drop (p < 0.001). Pressures in the mid-portion were also significantly higher than in the proximal portion (p < 0.001). These observations offer novel insights and support a role for compression in the pathophysiology of Achilles tendinopathy by demonstrating high intratendinous pressures at regions where Achilles tendinopathy typically occurs. To what extent managing intratendinous pressure might be successful in patients with Achilles tendinopathy by, for example, avoiding excessive stretching, modifying exercise therapy, and offering heel lifts requires further investigation. © 2022 The Authors.

Objective: To assess the psychometric properties of the Children and Adolescents Physical Activity and Sedentary-Questionnaire (CAPAS-Q) in healthy French children and adolescents. Methods: The CAPAS-Q has been developed through a rigorous collective procedure and consists of a 31 items self-administered questionnaire evaluating children’s 7-day PA and SB dimensions and subdomains. Participants (n = 103, aged 8–18 years old) completed the questionnaire twice (7 days apart) and wore an ActiGraph GT3X + accelerometer for 7 days. Anthropometric measurements and body composition were assessed. Results: Cronbach alpha for PA and SB dimensions were 0.71 and 0.68, respectively. Reproducibility was found moderate to good, with Lin’s coefficients of 0.69 and 0.68 for PA and SB dimensions, respectively. Reproducibility was higher for adolescents compared to children. PA dimension was positively correlated with moderate PA, vigorous PA, moderate to vigorous PA, and total PA times and negatively correlated with SB time (p < 0.05). SB dimension and screen time were positively correlated with SB time and negatively correlated with LPA, MPA, MVPA, and total PA times (p < 0.05). Spearman correlation coefficients were fair to moderate, ranging between 0.23–0.45. Conclusion: The CAPAS-Q proposes a reliable and valid evaluation of French children and adolescents’ PA and SB, providing clinicians with potential intervention levels to improve youth movement behaviors. © 2022 by the authors.",adolescents; children; physical activity; questionnaire; sedentary behaviors,Accelerometry; Adolescent; Child; Exercise; Humans; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires; adolescence; child care; child health; physical activity; public health; accelerometry; adolescent; adult; age; anthropometry; Article; body composition; body height; body mass; body weight; child; Children and Adolescents Physical Activity and Sedentary Questionnaire; correlation analysis; female; Frenchman; general health status assessment; health behavior; human; human experiment; male; normal human; physical activity; psychometry; questionnaire; reliability; reproducibility; school child; screen time; sedentary lifestyle; young adult; accelerometry; exercise; psychometry,"""Physical Activity, Fitness, and Health Studies in Children and Adolescents""",Physical Activity and Its Effects on Health and Well-being in Children and Adolescents,Physical Fitness in Children and Adolescents

Methods: The Military Health System Data Repository (MDR) was queried to identify all adult patients undergoing surgical treatment of a patellar tendon rupture in the Military Health System from 2014 to 2018. Patients who underwent either transosseous tunnel repair or suture anchor repair were included. Health records were examined to collect additional data. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression models were used to determine independent risk factors for rerupture. Results: A total of 450 knees in 437 patients were included. Transosseous tunnel repair was the most frequently used technique (314/450, 77%), followed by suture anchor repair (113/450, 25%). Rerupture occurred in 33 knees (7%). There was no difference in rerupture rate between transosseous tunnel repair and suture anchor repair (P = .15), and this result persisted within the multivariate logistic regression model. Among transosseous tunnel repairs, use of low tensile strength suture was an independent risk factor for repair failure (odds ratio [OR], 3.4; P = .016). Among suture anchor repairs, use of anchors 5.0 mm in diameter or greater (OR, 12.0; P = .027) was an independent risk factor for repair failure. Conclusions: There is no statistically significant difference in failure rate between transosseous tunnel repair and suture anchor repair in primary patellar tendon ruptures. However, the use of low tensile strength suture with transosseous tunnels and the use of suture anchors 5.0 mm in diameter or greater resulted in significantly higher failure rates. These data suggest that use of high tensile strength suture in transosseous tunnel repair and use of suture anchors less than 5.0 mm in diameter in suture anchor repair result in lower failure rate in primary patellar tendon repair.

Our aim in this research was to determine the effects of trunk impairment on fatigue and balance in children with hemiplegic CP. We included 65 ambulatory children with CP in this cross-sectional study, and we grouped them into those with greater trunk impairment (Group 1, n = 33) and lesser trunk impairment (Group 2, n = 32) according to their scores on the Trunk Imparment Scale (TIS). We assessed their fatique level using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory™ Version 4.0 Multidimensional Fatigue Scale (PedsQL-MFS), and their balance ability using the Pediatric Balance Scale (PBS). We found that the PedsQL-MFS parameters, except the general and cognitive fatigue scores, were significantly better for participants in Group 2 than in Group 1; however Group 2 showed significantly higher scores for balance ability than did Group 1 (p <.001). All of the TIS parameters were significantly correlated with sleep/rest fatigue, and PBS scores and trunk coordination were also significantly correlated with general fatigue (p =.013) and cognitive fatigue (p =.003) which are subparameters of the PedsQL-MFS and PBS (p <.001). However static balance was highly and negatively correlated with cognitive fatigue (p <.037).Increased trunk impairment contributed to the exacerbation of fatigue and balance problems in children with hemiplegic CP. Inadequate trunk control was associated with poor sleep and poor resting quality rather than perceived general and cognitive fatigue. © The Author(s) 2023.",Balance; Cerebral Palsy; Fatigue; Trunk Control; Trunk Impairment,Cerebral Palsy; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Hemiplegia; Humans; Postural Balance; Quality of Life; body equilibrium; cerebral palsy; child; complication; cross-sectional study; hemiplegia; human; quality of life,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

However, the involvement of individuals with disabilities is considerably less than that of their peers without disabilities. A higher rate of participation of individuals with disabilities in LTPA may be achieved by the active involvement of volunteers. This study aimed to describe the importance of volunteer involvement in a swimming organization focused on individuals with disabilities, as perceived by all participants, including swimmers with disabilities, their parents, volunteers, and coaches. The organization uses volunteers as swimming instructors who work individually with swimmers with disabilities. The data were obtained through 11 semi-structured interviews with swimmers with disabilities and their parents, volunteers, and coaches. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using a five-step inductive thematic analysis. As a result of the cooperation with the volunteer swimming instructors, swimmers with disabilities felt an improved range of movement, greater independence, and higher self-esteem than before they started using the services of the swimming organization. Consequently, even individuals with severe disabilities can participate in LTPA. Membership to the organization also provided space for the establishment of new social relations, and the instructors described them accepting persons with disabilities as their equals. More importantly, the involvement of volunteers enables organizations to provide respite care for parents. © 2022 by the authors.",adapted physical activity; disability; leisure time physical activity; respite care; social inclusion; swimming; volunteering,,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Participation and Barriers in Sports and Physical Activities for Individuals with Disabilities

In order to study the physiological and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) responses according to area sizes (i.e., 4 m×4 m, 6 m×6 m and 8 m×8 m) and training mode variations (i.e., groundwork, ne-waza; standing combat only, tachi-waza; and free combat, free randori), eighteen male judo athletes (age: 22.6±1.8 years) were randomly assigned, on separate days, to 9 experimental conditions (3 area sizes×3 training modes) with each condition lasting 4 min. Delta lactate [La] was calculated based on the blood lactate values measured before and after every condition. Heart rate (HR) was measured during and after each bout and RPE recorded at the end of each combat. The results showed that mean and peak HR, percentage of maximum HR (% HRmax), delta [La] values and RPE scores were lower in 4 m×4 m compared to 6 m×6 m and 8 m×8 m, and in groundwork training mode compared to standing combat and free randori (all p < 0.001). Furthermore, the 6 m×6 m condition induced lower delta [La] values than 8 m×8 m (p < 0.001) and free randori resulted in higher RPE scores than standing combat (p = 0.001). In conclusion, different training variables can be easily manipulated in a variety of different ways to specifically activate the energetic systems. Focusing on groundwork, the 6 m×6 m area size was found to be the most suitable condition to induce a higher cardiovascular response, while the standing combat and free randori in 6 m×6 m resulted in increased glycolytic activation compared to the groundwork condition. © 2024 Institute of Sport.

This study aimed to develop quantitative IPM measurement methods and clarify the relationship between IPM and knee flexion angle in community-dwelling older females. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. Overall, 128 healthy older women (age 65–79 years) were recruited from the community to evaluate the relationship between IPM and knee flexion angle. This study was performed between May 2015 and December 2017. The reference value of and sex differences in IPM were evaluated in 205 healthy young adults aged between 19 and 21 years. IPM was compared between healthy older and young women and was objectively measured using our specially designed patellofemoral arthrometer (PFA). Patellar mobility was calculated by normalization to body height. IPM reliability was assessed before all measurements. Results: Intraclass correlation coefficients for intratester and intertester reliabilities varied from 0.87 to 0.99. The normal range based on two standard deviations of inferior patellar displacement/body height was 5.9–13.5% (young men), 5.1–14.3% (young women), and 1.2–8.8% (older women). IPM was significantly lower in older than young women (P < 0.001). There was a significant positive correlation (r = 0.72 and P < 0.01) between IPM and knee flexion angle in healthy older women unable to flex the knee joint fully. Conclusions: Our PFA has good intratester and intertester reliability. The results suggest that IPM decreases with aging in women.

The management of chronic Achilles tendon rupture (CATR) is a topic of hot debate, and no consensus has been achieved. Surgical management of CATR is recommended. Several approaches, techniques, and grafts have been described. Open techniques carry a high risk of wound breakdown, infection, and necessitate long rehabilitation times. Surgical techniques with smaller incisions to reduce the risk of scar fibrosis, pain, and infection are becoming common. The ipsilateral tendon of the hallux flexor longus and the peroneus brevis is commonly used. Endoscopic transfer of the peroneus brevis tendon is an innovative alternative to other procedures, with comparable results of other autografts even in elite athletes. The tendon of the peroneus brevis is harvested by tendoscopy before performing a calcaneal tendon endoscopy and fixing the graft in a calcaneal tunnel using an interference screw. After surgery, an anterior splint is placed for 3 weeks with immediate forefoot weight bearing. The rehabilitation starts on the 15th postoperative day. © The Author(s) 2024.",Chronic Achilles tendon rupture; Endoscopic surgery; Peroneus brevis transfer,,"""Achilles Tendinopathy and Musculoskeletal Ultrasound Studies in Sport Medicine""",Achilles Tendon Health & Rehabilitation Research,Tendon Rehabilitation and Treatment Methods

Methods: A 26-question survey was completed by arthroscopic shoulder surgeons. Surgeon demographics were evaluated. Surgeons were queried about shoulder arthroscopic graft use and rationale then responses were analyzed based on demographics. Results: In total, 260 surgeons completed the survey. Fifty-one percent of surgeons reported a decrease in the volume of SCR use in the past 5 years. Less than 3% of surgeons used SCR in >90% of irreparable RCR cases, compared with 38% using SCR in <10% of irreparable cases (P < .05). Surgeons performing >100 RCR annually (42%; P < .05) and those employed in the hospital setting (44%; P < .05) reported an overall increase in the use of SCR. More international surgeons (67%) decreased their use of SCR compared with U.S. surgeons (44%; P < .05). In contrast, bioinductive graft use is generally on the rise, with 48% of surgeons reporting increased use since first use, although used in <10% of cases by 54% of surgeons. Sixty-eight percent of surgeons performing >100 RCRs annually used bioinductive grafts (P < .05). Fewer international surgeons (30%) performed biologic augmentation (P < .05). Suboptimal published outcomes (40%) and no perceived patient benefit (40%) were most cited for decreased SCR use. Surgeons reporting increased use cited improved personal patient outcomes (72%). Conclusions: Arthroscopic surgeons report decrease in volume of SCR use in the past 5 years. Surgeon's personal experience of patient outcome and suboptimal published results were the strongest factors impacting decision-making. In contrast, bioinductive graft use is increasing. However, most surgeons use these grafts in a relatively small percentage of cases.

Adductor muscles are the most involved site of the groin, accounting for up to one-fourth of muscle injuries of that region. Physical therapy and rehabilitation programs for adductor-related groin pain using active exercises are effective in getting athletes back to sport. However, the return-to-play time varies according to the injury severity. Minor lesions can recover in 1-2 weeks, while severer injuries require 8-12 weeks. To enhance tendon healing and shorten the return to play time, intrandentinous injections of Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) have been proposed. An increasing body of evidence in literature have shown efficacy of platelet rich plasma in aiding the healing process in tendinopathies. Similarly, more recent evidences have proven hyaluronic (HA) acid to have anti-inflammatory, proliferative, repairing, and analgesic effects.

Therefore, the purpose of the study was to assess inter-individual variability in hamstrings recovery after a sport-specific repeated-sprint training (RST), through sprint-specific markers of muscle recovery and associated muscle damage biomarkers in women and men. Methods: Healthy females (n = 14) and males (n = 15) underwent 10 repeated 40-m sprints with a 3-min rest pause between each repetition. Force-generating capacity (FGC) by the 90°hip:20°knee test and range of motion Jurdan test, together with serum biomarkers [sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase (sMtCK), oxidative stress, irisin] were tested at baseline and 24-, 48- and 72-h post-exercise through a repeated measures design. Participants were classified according to FGC loss into high responders (HR) and low responders (LR). Results: 21 individuals (10 females, 11 males) were classified as HR (FGC loss >20% and recovery >48 h), while 8 individuals (4 females, 4 males) were classified as LR. HR individuals showed unrecovered maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) torque until 72 h post-training (p = 0.003, np2 = 0.170), whereas only HR males showed decreased range of motion (p = 0.026, np2 = 0.116). HR individuals also showed increased sMtCK (p = 0.016, np2 = 0.128), oxidative stress (p = 0.038, np2 = 0.106) and irisin (p = 0.019, np2 = 0.123). Conclusion: There is inter-individual variability in the muscular response to a sport-specific RST, identifiable by MVIC torque assessment. The findings support that the 90°hip:20°knee test is a powerful indirect test to screen hamstrings recovery in both women and men, in a cost-effective way. However, the Jurdan test might not be able to monitor hamstrings recovery in sportswomen after RST. Decreases in muscle capacity are linked to damage to muscle sarcolemma and mitochondria until 72 h post-exercise. Overall, 72 h will not be adequate time to restore hamstrings structure and function after a sport-specific RST in both female and male responders.

More recently, international utilization of the quadriceps tendon (QT) autograft for primary and revision ACLR has increased in popularity. Recent literature suggests that ACLR with the QT may yield less donor site morbidity than the BPTB and better patient-reported outcomes than the HT. Additionally, anatomic and biomechanical studies have highlighted the robust properties of the QT itself, with superior levels of collagen density, length, size, and load-to-failure strength compared to the BPTB. Although previous literature has described rehabilitation considerations for the BPTB and HT autografts, there is less published with respect to the QT. Given the known impact of the various ACLR surgical techniques on postoperative rehabilitation, the purpose of this clinical commentary is to present the procedure-specific surgical and rehabilitation considerations for ACLR with the QT, as well as further highlight the need for procedure-specific rehabilitation strategies after ACLR by comparing the QT to the BPTB and HT autografts. © 2023, North American Sports Medicine Institute.

This randomized controlled trial aimed to compare the effectiveness of a tele-rehabilitation program with traditional in-person physiotherapy in improving outcomes for this population. Methods: This randomized controlled trial enrolled a large sample of 780 athletes with sports-related injuries to compare the effectiveness of tele-rehabilitation and traditional in-person physiotherapy. Blinding procedures were implemented to minimize bias. The intervention group received tele-rehabilitation physiotherapy, whereas the control group received traditional in-person physiotherapy. Pre- and post-intervention assessments were conducted to measure outcome measures, including range of motion, muscle strength, pain levels, and functional performance. Results: Significant improvements were observed in all outcome measures in both the tele-rehabilitation and in-person groups from baseline to postintervention. Independent t tests demonstrated no significant differences between the two groups in any of the outcome measures. These findings indicate that the tele-rehabilitation program was as effective as traditional in-person physiotherapy in improving the outcomes of athletes with sports-related injuries, even in a large sample size of 780 participants. Conclusion: This study provides robust evidence supporting the feasibility and effectiveness of tele-rehabilitation programs as viable alternatives to traditional in-person physiotherapy for athletes with sports-related injuries. These findings highlight the potential of tele-rehabilitation to significantly expand access to high-quality physiotherapy services for a large number of athletes. Further research should focus on evaluating the long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of tele-rehabilitation programs in sports rehabilitation using larger sample sizes.

Pain science education (PSE) is a promising avenue for managing chronic pain, but targeted PSE is needed. The Concept of Pain Inventory for Adults (COPI-Adult) is a newly developed self-reported outcome measure aimed at targeting PSE. It is currently unavailable in Danish and has unknown reliability. The aims of this study were (1) to translate and contextually adapt to Danish and (2) to determine reliability in terms of test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and measurement error. Methods - Step (1) was as follows: a dual panel approach was used to translate, contextually adapt into a Danish version. Step (2) was follows: a heterogenic sample of Danish adults >18 years (n = 150) was included in the test-retest analysis, test interval between 7 and 14 days, both answered via REDCap-link. Based on COSMIN recommendations, the following reliabilities were estimated: the test-retest using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC2.1) and internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha level. Measurement error in terms of standard error of measurement (SEM) and smallest detectable change (SDC) were calculated. Results - Step (1) was as follows: the first panel reached 100% consensus on the wording of the COPI-Adult (DK), with no alterations by the second panel. Step (2) was as follows: good to excellent test-retest reliability was found with ICC2.1 value (95% confidence interval) 0.88 (0.84-0.91), excellent internal consistency for the 13-item COPI-Adult (DK) with α = 0.939, SEM of 2.53, and SDC of 7.02. Discussion - The COPI-Adult (DK) was successfully translated and contextually adapted. It is a reliable questionnaire with excellent internal consistency. The COPI-Adult (DK) shows promise in research and clinical practice.

Methods: Patients presenting with an ACL tear were randomized into two groups, BFR and control, at their initial clinic visit. Quadriceps strength was measured using a handheld dynamometer in order to calculate peak force, average force, and time to peak force during seated leg extension at the initial clinic visit and repeated on the day of surgery. All patients were provided education on standardized exercises to be performed 5 days per week for 2 weeks between the initial clinic visit and date of surgery. The BFR group was instructed to perform these exercises with a pneumatic cuff set to 80% of limb occlusion pressure placed over the proximal thigh. Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement System Physical Function (PROMIS-PF), knee range of motion, and quadriceps circumference were gathered at the initial clinic visit and day of surgery, and patients were monitored for adverse effects. Results: A total 45 patients met inclusion criteria and elected to participate. There were 23 patients randomized to the BFR group and 22 patients randomized into the control group. No significant differences were noted between the BFR and control groups in any demographic characteristics (48% vs 64% male [P = .271] and average age 26.5 ± 12.0 vs 27.0 ± 11.0 [P = .879] in BFR and control, respectively). During the initial clinic visit, there were no significant differences in quadriceps circumference, peak quadriceps force generation, time to peak force, average force, pain, and PROMIS scales (P > .05 for all). Following completion of a 2-week home prehabilitation protocol, all patients indeterminant of cohort demonstrated decreased strength loss in the operative leg compared to the nonoperative leg (P < .05 for both) However, there were no significant differences in any strength or outcome measures between the BFR and control groups (P > .05 for all). There were no complications experienced in either group, and both were compliant with the home-based prehabilitation program. Conclusions: A 2-week standardized prehabilitation protocol preceding ACL reconstruction resulted in a significant improvement in personal quadriceps peak force measurements, both with and without the use of BFR. No difference in quadriceps circumference, strength, or patient reported outcomes were found between the BFR and the control group. The home-based BFR prehabiliation protocol was found to be feasible, accessible, and well tolerated by patients.

Historically, many studies on athletes have focused on male athletes and been generalized to female athletes. Hypothesis: Studies with female first or senior authors will isolate female athletes as study participants more frequently than studies with male first or senior authors. Study Design: Systematic review; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) protocols, original research studies published between 2017 and 2021 that analyzed athletes were systematically screened from the 6 top sports medicine journals (British Journal of Sports Medicine; Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery; Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy; American Journal of Sports Medicine; Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine; Sports Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach). Articles were included for analysis if they met the following criteria: (1) original sports medicine research study, (2) analysis involving athletes, and (3) inclusion of ≥10 participants. Exclusion criteria included (1) review articles of any type and (2) cadaveric studies. The determination of author sex was completed using the name-to-gender assignment algorithm Genderize.io (https://genderize.io/). Results: A total of 1146 studies were included in quantitative analysis. There were 246 studies with a female first author (21.5%) and 191 studies with a female senior author (16.7%). When looking at all authors (first, senior, and intermediate), 19.9% were female. Female first authors were over 4 times more likely to isolate female athletes in clinical research than male first authors (17.5% vs 3.8%, respectively; P <.001). Female senior authors were approximately twice as likely to isolate female athletes compared with male senior authors (11.5% vs 5.8%, respectively; P <.001). Conclusion: Female first authors were significantly more likely to perform research isolating female athletes. While improving the frequency of female athlete research is multifactorial, increasing the number of female researchers may have a direct effect on improving gender equality in sports medicine research. © 2024 The Author(s).",female athlete; representation; sex; sports medicine,adult; algorithm; article; athlete; female; gender equity; human; knee surgery; male; orthopedics; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; quantitative analysis; sports medicine; surgery; systematic review; traumatology; treatment outcome,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

In ACL patients, intra-tester reliability was moderate to excellent (ICC range: 0.53-0.94, SEM range: 0.14-0.88 mm, and SDC range: 0.38-2.44 mm), with the exception of one measurement (ICC: 0.26 95% CI [−3.43; 0.89]), whereas inter-tester reliability was overall good (ICC range: 0.61-0.89, SEM range: 0.29-0.71 mm, and SDC range: 0.79-1.97 mm). Reliability measures between grip techniques indicated that the Lachman grip was more reliable than the anterior drawer grip. In conclusion, the Lachmeter showed variation between reliability measures, ranging from poor to good in healthy subjects and moderate to excellent in ACL patients. Future studies are needed to validate the Lachmeter against a gold-standard knee laxity assessment.

Half of the girls (n = 19) trained the strength abilities of the lower limbs for 10 weeks (3 times a week) and the other half of the girls (n = 19) made up the “Control.” To assess the one-leg posture stability, fluctuations of the center of pressure (COP) and fluctuations of the angles in the ankle and knee joints were determined in the tests: (1) on a stabiloplatform with eyes open (ЕO) and eyes closed (ЕC); (2) on a low see-saw (h = 10 cm) with ЕO and ЕC; and (3) on a high (h = 30 cm) see-saw with ЕC. Strength abilities were recorded using functional tests. The composition of the whole body and lower limbs was determined using bioimpedance analysis. Compared with the “Control” group, the trained girls showed an increase of strength abilities without signs of muscle hypertrophy, as well as a tendency (p < 0.09) to an increased stability of the knee joint in standing on a low see-saw. The accuracy of the reproduction of the vertical body inclination did not change after training. However, decreases of fluctuations in COP and angles in the ankle joint during stance on the stabiloplatform and on the low see-saw, as well as an increase in the balance time on the high see-saw, revealed after strength training, did not differ from the changes in these indices in “Control.” Thus, despite the increased stability of the knee joint, strength training of the leg muscles has practically no effect on the regulation of static (on the solid support) and semi-dynamic (on the movable see-saw) postural balance. © 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.","postural stability, stabilography, static and semi-dynamic balance, strength training, one-leg posture; see-saw",,"""Effects of Various Interventions on Postural Stability and Balance Control""",Postural Stability and Lower Limb Motor Control Studies,Evaluation and Improvement of Postural Balance and Muscle Strength

Altered leptin levels are known to be associated with depressive symptoms, however discrepancies in the results of increased or decreased levels exist. Due to various limitations associated with commonly used antidepressant drugs, alternatives such as exercise therapy are gaining more importance. Therefore, the current study investigates whether depressed patients have higher leptin levels compared to healthy controls and if exercise is efficient to reduce these levels. Methods: Leptin levels of 105 participants with major depressive disorder (MDD; 45.7% female, age mean ± SEM: 39.1 ± 1.0) and 34 healthy controls (HC; 61.8% female, age mean ± SEM: 36.0 ± 2.0) were measured before and after a bicycle ergometer test. Additionally, the MDD group was separated into three groups: two endurance exercise intervention groups (EX) differing in their intensities, and a waiting list control group (WL). Leptin levels were measured pre and post a 12-week exercise intervention or the waiting period. Results: Baseline data showed no significant differences in leptin levels between the MDD and HC groups. As expected, correlation analyses displayed significant relations between leptin levels and body weight (HC: r = 0.474, p = 0.005; MDD: r = 0.198, p = 0.043) and even more with body fat content (HC: r = 0.755, p < 0.001; MDD: r = 0.675, p < 0.001). The acute effect of the bicycle ergometer test and the 12-week training intervention showed no significant changes in circulating leptin levels. Conclusion: Leptin levels were not altered in patients with major depression compared to healthy controls and exercise, both the acute response and after 12 weeks of endurance training, had no effect on the change in leptin levels.

This preparation has anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties and accelerates recovery following acute soft tissue injuries. Aims: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of WHOL in treating acute soft tissue injury associated with qi stagnation and blood stasis syndrome and to provide a basis for applying for the protection of varieties of Chinese medicine for WHOL. Methods: This study was a randomized, controlled, double-blind, multicenter clinical trial in which Fufang Shang Tong Capsule (FFSTC) was selected as the control drug. A total of 480 subjects with acute soft tissue injury associated with qi stagnation and blood stasis syndrome were randomly divided into a test and control group in a 3:1 ratio. The duration of drug treatment was 10 days. The primary outcome was Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score for pain (including pain at rest and pain on activity). Secondary outcomes included the disappearance time of the pain at rest and on activity; the curative effect of TCM syndrome and improvement in the individual symptoms of TCM (swelling, ecchymosis, and dysfunction); and changes in C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. Safety was assessed using vital signs, laboratory examinations, electrocardiograms, and physical examinations. Results: Patient compliance was satisfactory in both groups (all between 80% and 120%). After 4 days of treatment, the WHOL group was superior to the FFSTC group in decreasing the VAS scores for pain at rest (−1.88 ± 1.13 vs. −1.60 ± 0.93, p < 0.05) and on activity (−2.16 ± 1.18 vs. −1.80 ± 1.07, p < 0.05). After 7 days of treatment, the WHOL group was superior to the FFSTC group in decreasing the VAS scores for pain on activity (−3.87 ± 1.60 vs. −3.35 ± 1.30, p < 0.01) and improving swelling (cure rate: 60.4% vs. 46.2%, p < 0.05; obvious effective rate: 60.7% vs. 47.0%, p < 0.05). After 10 days of treatment, the WHOL group was superior to the FFSTC group in decreasing the levels of CRP (−0.13 ± 2.85 vs. 0.25 ± 2.09, p < 0.05) and improving the TCM syndrome (cure rate: 44.1% vs. 30.8%, p < 0.05) and swelling (cure rate: 75.6% vs. 67.5%, p < 0.01; obvious effective rate: 75.6% vs. 68.4%, p < 0.05; effective rate: 77.0% vs. 71.8%, p < 0.05). The disappearance time of pain at rest was 8 days in both groups and 9 days on activity in both groups. In addition, there was no statistical difference between the incidence of adverse events (4.5% vs. 2.6%, p > 0.05) and adverse reactions (0.3% vs. 0%, p > 0.05) between the WHOL group and the FFSTC group. No serious adverse events occurred in either group, and no subjects were withdrawn because of adverse events. Conclusion: WHOL relieves the symptoms caused by acute soft tissue injury associated with qi stagnation and blood stasis syndrome more rapidly than FFSTC, and it is effective and safe in the treatment of acute soft tissue injury. Future studies still need a larger sample size to verify its efficacy and safety. Clinical Trial Registration: https://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.html?proj=149531, Identifier ChiCTR2200056411.

A major challenge to promoting PA is that sedentary or low-active people experience negative shifts in affective valence (feeling bad versus good) in response to moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA. Interestingly, empirical data indicate that listening to music during acute bouts of PA positively alters affective valence (feeling good versus bad), reduces perceived exertion, and improves physical performance and oxygen utilization efficiency. From the viewpoint of the ancient principle of psychological hedonism – humans have ultimate desires to obtain pleasure and avoid displeasure – we elaborate on three putative mechanisms underlying the affective and ergogenic effects of music on acute bouts of PA: (1) musical pleasure and reward, (2) rhythmic entrainment, and (3) sensory distraction from physical exertion. Given that a positive shift in affective valence during an acute bout of PA is associated with more PA in the future, an important question arises as to whether the affective effect of music on acute PA can be carried over to promote long-term PA. Although this research question seems intuitive, to our knowledge, it has been scarcely investigated. We propose a theoretical model of Music as an Affective Stimulant to Physical Activity (MASPA) to further explain the putative mechanisms underlying the use of music to promote long-term PA. We believe there have been important gaps in music-based interventions in terms of the rationale supporting various components of the intervention and the efficacy of these interventions to promote long-term PA. Our specification of relevant mechanisms and proposal of a new theoretical model may advance our understanding of the optimal use of music as an affective, ergogenic, and sensory stimulant for PA promotion. Future directions are suggested to address the gaps in the literature.

The objective of this reviews is to characterize physical activity interventions offered in the literature and explore their effects during treatment for people with substance use disorders with excluding studies focusing only on tobacco use. A systematic search of seven databases on articles including a physical activity intervention during a treatment for substance use disorder was done and an examination of the presence of bias was performed. A total of 43 articles including 3135 participants were identified. Most studies were randomized controlled trial (81%), followed by pre-post design (14%) and cohort studies (5%). The most common physical activity intervention identified was of moderate intensity, 3 times per week ( 1 hour) for 13 weeks. Cessation/reduction of substance use was the most studied outcome (21 studies, 49%), and 75% showed a decrease in substance use following physical activity intervention. Aerobic capacity was the second most studied effect (14 studies, 33%), with more than 71% of studies showing improvement. Twelve studies (28%) reported a decrease of depressive symptoms. Physical activity interventions in a treatment for substance use disorder seem to be a promising, but more methodologically rigorous scientific studies are needed. Copyright: © 2023 Piché et al.

In Denmark, standard rehabilitation (SR) consists of a combination of patient education and supervised physical exercise involving a standardized neuromuscular training program. As an evidence- based alternative, high-load (>70% 1RM) resistance training (HIRT) has shown positive rehabilitation effects in knee-OA but may not be tolerated in all patients (∼25%) due to knee joint pain. However, low-load resistance training (20-40% 1RM) with concurrent partial blood-flow restriction (BFR) appears to produce effects similar to HIRT yet involving reduced joint pain during and after exercise. The aim is to examine the effect of low-load BFR training compared to SR on pain, thigh muscle mass and muscle function in adults with knee-OA. We hypothesize that 12 weeks of BFR will lead to superior improvements in pain, muscle mass and mechanical muscle function compared to SR. Methods and analysis 90 participants diagnosed with radiographic knee-OA will be randomized to either BFR or SR twice a week for 12 weeks. BFR will consist of two selected lower limb strength exercises performed with an inflated pneumatic occlusion cuff. Intervention procedures in SR consist of a full 8 weeks GLA:D course followed by 4 weeks of team group training. Primary outcome variable is the change in KOOS-Pain subscale from baseline to 12 weeks. Secondary outcome variables are changes in pain sensitivity, functional performance, muscle mass and mechanical muscle function. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses will be conducted. One-way analysis of variance will be performed to evaluate between-group changes. Pre-to-post intervention comparisons will be analyzed using a mixed linear model. Regression analysis will be performed to evaluate potential associations between selected outcome variables.  © 2023 Sørensen et al.

Because motor function requires a combination of muscle strength, joint flexibility, and motor coordination, we designed a supervised multicomponent exercise intervention (EXErcise for Cerebral Palsy, or EXECP) for individuals with CP. Our aim was to evaluate the effects of the EXECP intervention and its retention after it ceased. Methods The EXECP intervention combined strength training for the lower limbs and trunk muscles, passive stretching for the lower limb muscles, and inclined treadmill gait training. Eighteen participants with CP (mean age, 14 yr; 13 were male) were tested twice before the 3-month intervention and twice after the intervention, each test separated by 3 months. Seventeen typically developing age- and sex-matched controls were tested twice. Motor function was assessed with the 6-min walking test (6MWT) and the gross motor function measure dimensions D and E. Passive joint flexibility was measured with goniometry. Isometric and concentric muscle strength were assessed at the knee, ankle, and trunk joints. Results The EXECP intervention successfully increased 6MWT (P < 0.001), gross motor function measure (P = 0.004), and muscle strength for knee and trunk muscles (P < 0.05), although no changes were observed for ankle joint muscles. Hip and knee joint flexibility also increased (P < 0.05). After the retention period, all tested variables except the 6MWT and knee joint flexibility regressed and were not different from the pretests. Conclusions The improvements in strength, flexibility, and possibly motor coordination brought by the EXECP intervention were transferred to significant functional gains. The regression toward baseline after the intervention highlights that training must be a lifelong decision for individuals with CP.  © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",CHILDREN; REHABILITATION; TRAINING; WALKING; YOUNG ADULTS,"Adolescent; Cerebral Palsy; Female; Gait; Humans; Lower Extremity; Male; Muscle Strength; Muscle, Skeletal; Range of Motion, Articular; adolescent; cerebral palsy; female; gait; human; lower limb; male; muscle strength; physiology; range of motion; skeletal muscle","""Physical Activity Interventions and Motor Competence in Children with Disabilities""",Motor Skills Development and Intervention in Children with Disabilities,Physical Fitness in Children and Adolescents

They are the following: (1) breathing exercises associated with yoga may help maintain pulmonary health and protect the upper respiratory tract, the portal of entry for the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection; (2) improved immunity resulting from sustained yoga practice may help prevent COVID-19 contraction; (3) stress reduction of yoga may be effective in maintaining the mental well-being needed to combat the extra stress of living during a pandemic. Related to this claim, we examine testimony to the effect that yoga also gave people meaning and purpose in their lives during the isolating lockdown period. While exploring these beneficent advantages, we further address a serious health-related counterclaim that the community practice of yoga has the potential to create conditions that facilitate disease transmission due to heavy breathing in small, enclosed spaces. This balanced analysis introduces an interesting tension relevant to public health policy, namely that well-intended attempts to minimize indoor interaction for the sake of reducing the spread of infection may impact the effectiveness of yogic therapies and impede the freedom to practice the spiritual discipline of yoga. They may also not reduce the spread of infection enough to warrant their damaging effects on yoga practice. We suggest ways for resolving this tension and conclude with some concrete recommendations for facilitating yoga practice in future pandemics. These include (1) that public health policymakers consider programs that provide access to yoga by ensuring hospital prayer rooms appropriate in size and that, where feasible, yoga studios conduct their lessons outside in open areas; (2) that resources be devoted to providing therapeutic access to virtual yoga as a federal program, despite potential resistance to this idea of government involvement due to concerns that yoga has its origins in heterodox religious practice. © 2023 by the authors.",COVID-19; Hatha; health benefits; mental health; online yoga; subtle body; Vinyasa; yoga,,"""Impacts of COVID-19 on Physical and Mental Health, Exercise Habits, and Rehabilitation Strategies""","Impact of COVID-19 on Health, Physical Activity and Quality of Life",Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

MethodS: data on demographic information, Body Mass index, resting metabolic rate (rMr), physical activity levels of academicians (n.=62, 32W, 30M) have been collected. reSUltS: their total weekly energy expenditure in relation to total physical activity was similar to each other as 1743.4±2189.10 MET-min/week for men and 1074.04±1299.09 MET-min/week for women. The RMR was significantly higher in men (1994.66±683.41 kcal/day) than women (1467.81±311.47 kcal/day) (p<0.001). Supporting this outcome, percent body fat was found higher in women (26.38±6.62%) than men (21.46±6.17%) (p<0.05). Men spent longer times “sitting” (p<0.05), it had a weak effect on their total physical activity (p<0.05). conclUSionS: although women were sitting less than men during day, they were less physically active. Men were more involved with heavy to moderate physical activities with higher resting metabolic rate. Since walking was a preferred activity in both genders, they may be motivated to increase their walking based physical activity in and out of the campus as well as at home. © 2020 Edizioni Minerva Medica.",exercise; Fat body; Sports,adult; Article; body fat; body mass; body weight; coronavirus disease 2019; exercise; fat mass; female; human; lifestyle modification; major clinical study; male; metabolic equivalent; metabolic rate; obesity; observational study; physical activity; questionnaire; resting metabolic rate; sedentary lifestyle; sedentary time; sex difference; sitting; walking; work environment,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Methods: The study included 57 elite Taekwondo athletes who participated in advanced competitions at a training camp for the year 2022. An independent-sample t-test was performed to compare the sex-specific measure of back pain, the MODI, muscle function, and recovery period. Pearson's correlation was used to investigate the relationship between variables, and simple linear regression analysis was performed to identify factors affecting variables. Statistical significance was set to α = 0.05, and all statistical analyses were performed with SPSS version 27.0 for Windows. Results: Male athletes had a lower pain scale (3.41 vs. 4.86; P = 0.006) and MODI (14.03 vs. 20.75; P = 0.004) than female athletes but longer recovery period (8.66 vs. 6.21; P = 0.033). Additionally, for all athletes, the pain scale and MODI affected the left/right rotation ratio (P < 0.001, P = 0.005, respectively) and the recovery period (P < 0.001, P = 0.001, respectively), and, as the pain score and MODI increased, the left/right rotation ratio and recovery period also increased. Conclusion: For all Taekwondo athletes, the pain score and MODI affected the ratio of the left/right rotation and recovery period. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an exercise program to alleviate the left/right rotation imbalance of Taekwondo athletes. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS",Athletes; Back injuries; Martial arts; Taekwondo,,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Muscle Strength and Recovery in Sports Performance

Methods: Women aged (≥70) were allocated into three groups: RS, SR and control (CR). The experimental groups (RS and SR) performed balance exercises with the addition of rhythmic stabilization techniques (RS group) or with stabilizers reversal (SR group) for 15 min. The CR group performed the exercises without adding the PNF stabilization techniques. Participants performed the Time Up and Go (TUG) test, the Functional Reach Test (FRT) and static and dynamic stabilometry pre and post intervention. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests were used for comparison between groups and post hoc analysis, respectively, with p ≤ 0.05. For the effect size measurements, the r for Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney signal were used. Results: For functional tests intra-group analysis, a reduction in TUG time and an increase in FRT range (p ≤ 0.05) were observed in RS e SR groups. Stabilometry analysis showed a significant difference only for the RS group, with reduced average velocity of the centre of pressure (COP), and an increased in the left foot pressure. Conclusions: A single RS or SR session reduced the TUG time and the range distance in the FRT in elderly women. A single session of the RS technique was also able to reduce the mean velocity of the COP and the maximum pressure on the left foot.

This study aimed to compare the BESS results between the CAI and healthy groups using conventional BESS scores and inertial sensor data. The BESS test (six conditions: double-leg, single-leg, and tandem stances on firm and foam surfaces, respectively) was performed for the CAI (n = 16) and healthy control (n = 16) groups with inertial sensors mounted on the sacrum and anterior shank. The BESS score was calculated visually by the examiner by counting postural sway as an error based on the recorded video. The root mean square for resultant acceleration (RMSacc) in the anteroposterior, mediolateral, and vertical directions was calculated from each inertial sensor affixed to the sacral and shank surfaces during the BESS test. The mixed-effects analysis of variance and unpaired t-test were used to assess the effects of group and condition on the BESS scores and RMSacc. No significant between-group differences were found in the RMSacc of the sacral and shank surfaces, and the BESS scores (P > 0.05), except for the total BESS score in the foam condition (CAI: 14.4 ± 3.7, control: 11.7 ± 3.4; P = 0.039). Significant main effects of the conditions were found with respect to the BESS scores and RMSacc for the sacral and anterior shank (P < 0.05). The BESS test with inertial sensors can detect differences in the BESS conditions for athletes with CAI. However, our method could not detect any differences between the CAI and healthy groups. © 2023, Journal of Sport Science and Medicine.

It has been proposed that biomedical technologies, including accelerometers and their algorithms, should undergo rigorous verification as well as analytical and clinical validation to demonstrate that they are fit for purpose. The aim of this study was to use the V3 framework to assess the analytical and clinical validity of a wrist-worn measurement system of stepping volume and rate, formed by the GENEActiv accelerometer and GENEAcount step counting algorithm. The analytical validity was assessed by measuring the level of agreement between the wrist-worn system and a thigh-worn system (activPAL), the reference measure. The clinical validity was assessed by establishing the prospective association between the changes in stepping volume and rate with changes in physical function (SPPB score). The agreement of the thigh-worn reference system and the wrist-worn system was excellent for total daily steps (CCC = 0.88, 95% CI 0.83–0.91) and moderate for walking steps and faster-paced walking steps (CCC = 0.61, 95% CI 0.53–0.68 and 0.55, 95% CI 0.46–0.64, respectively). A higher number of total steps and faster paced-walking steps was consistently associated with better physical function. After 24 months, an increase of 1000 daily faster-paced walking steps was associated with a clinically meaningful increase in physical function (0.53 SPPB score, 95% CI 0.32–0.74).

Survivors’ priorities in living their lives and health professionals’ recognition influence survivors’ perceptions of their needs. From the perspectives of survivors and service providers, this study investigated survivors’ long-term priorities for continuing their lives after stroke. A qualitative study was conducted with a convenience sample of 40 stroke survivors and a purposive sample of 11 providers who had worked with survivors for more than five years and were currently managers of community-based stroke care services or leaders of volunteer groups. Following the survivors’ interviews, non-participant observations of a random day’s activities were conducted. Data were transcribed verbatim. Survivors’ and providers’ data were analyzed separately and then together thematically. Five themes emerged: healing the mind in order to move forward, optimizing adaptations and maintaining physical function, living a safe and cost-effective life, returning to work, and giving back to society. Community-based services can be improved to offer more at-home, technology-supported psychological and self-management interventions, barrier-free and one-stop services, and opportunities for employment and volunteering. It would be worthwhile to invest in conducting public education to promote social inclusion and strengthening collaboration between academic and community organizations. © 2022 The Author(s).

This study is a cross-sectional analysis from PROESP-Br database with 77,384 children and adolescents with an age range of 6–18 years. We use data about the horizontal jump test and 20-m sprint test (the covariables were age, height, body mass, arm-span and maturity offset). The sprint was classified using percentiles, the coefficient of determination (R2), β values, and p-value <0.05 were calculated (sprint as dependent and horizontal jump performance as independent) in each category. We identify a significant correlation between horizontal jump performance and sprint (R2 cubic for boys: 0.265; R2 cubic for girls: 0.204). For girls and boys, the greater R2 was identified in the regular (P40–60), good (P60–80), and very good (P80–98) categories. For these three categories, each centimetre more in the horizontal jump was a reduction of between 0.005 and 0.007 s in the 20-m sprint test. The results demonstrate that children and adolescents with extreme levels of sprinting (very slow or very fast) have a sprint performance that is not related to horizontal jump performance, independent of anthropometric factors, age, and maturity offset. © 2023 Cardiff Metropolitan University.","muscle power; Velocity, motor performance; young people",,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Effects of different training methods on athletic performance and injury prevention

Blood flow restriction (BFR) has been proven to be effective in improving function in low-load training, which is suitable for post-op rehabilitation. We explored the effectiveness and safety of BFR therapy in DRF patients who underwent surgery. Materials and methods: Thirty-five patients were randomly assigned to either the BFR or the regular training (RT; no BFR therapy) groups. All patients completed the same 4-week postoperative rehabilitation program, including anti-inflammatory treatments, strengthening and range of motion (ROM) training. In the BFR group, the pressure was 120 mmHg in strengthening training course. Pain, circumferences of wrists and forearms, ROM, muscle strength, and D-dimer levels were evaluated at weeks 0, 2, and 4. Radius union scoring system (RUSS) was measured at weeks 4 and 12. Finally, wrist functionality (Cooney modification) was evaluated at week 12. Results: The BFR group had significantly decreased pain levels compared with the RT group (p < 0.01, effect size= 2.33, −2.44 at weeks 2 and 4). Swelling was effectively relieved in both groups. The wrist swelling was less in the BFR group (p < 0.01, effect size = −2.17 at week 4). The isometric strength of wrist extension (p < 0.01, effect size = 1.5, 3.02 at weeks 2 and 4), flexion (p < 0.01, effect size = 1.33, 2.53 at weeks 2 and 4), and functionality significantly increased in the BFR group (p < 0.01, effect size = 2.80 at week 12). No risk of VT in the BFR group was found. BFR did not threaten bone healing. Conclusions: In patients with DRF who underwent corrective surgery, BFR therapy effectively relieved pain and swelling, increased muscle strength and wrist function, and had no additional risks for bone healing and VT. © 2023 The Author(s).

The purpose of this study was to report the results of orthopaedic medical examinations in adolescent amateur weightlifters that were performed cross-sectionally from 2012 to 2019. The orthopaedic medical examination included physical examinations, generalized joint laxity, muscle and joint tightness, static alignment, muscle volume of the lower extremities, and medial longitudinal arch of the foot (the height from the tip of the navicular tubercle to the ground surface). A questionnaire survey regarding pain in the spine and lower extremities was also performed. A total of 99 adolescent weightlifters were included (male/female, 71/28; mean age, 16.2 ± 0.2 years). A total of 9.1% had received orthopaedic treatments, with spine injuries being the most prevalent. Of those who had not received orthopaedic treatments, 31.1% had pain in the spine or lower extremities (for >4 weeks). There were no significant gender differences in the incidence of pain or positive findings of physical examinations. Female weightlifters had a more reduced dorsiflexion of the ankle joint than male weightlifters (p = 0.02). Male weightlifters had a lower flexibility of the quadriceps than female weightlifters. The results of orthopaedic medical examinations in this study may help clinicians and young weightlifters to prevent injuries in competitive weightlifting. © 2022 by the authors.",adolescent weightlifters; early sports specialization; gender difference; orthopaedic medical examination,Adolescent; Athletes; Exercise; Female; Humans; Male; Orthopedics; Pain; Weight Lifting; adolescence; health impact; health risk; injury; medical geography; muscle; physical activity; public health; adolescent; amateur weightlifter; ankle dorsiflexion angle; arthropathy; Article; athlete; controlled study; cross-sectional study; female; foot medial longitudinal arch; human; incidence; joint laxity; joint mobility; joint tightness; leg injury; leg pain; limb pain; lower limb; male; muscle mass; muscle tightness; musculoskeletal system examination; musculoskeletal system parameters; orthopedics; outcome assessment; physical examination; Q angle; quadriceps femoris muscle; questionnaire; sex difference; spinal pain; spine injury; standing; static alignment; weight lifting; athlete; exercise; pain; physiology,"""Analysis of Biomechanics, Exercise Techniques, and Physiological Adaptations in Various Physical Activities""",Lower Limb Muscle Strength and Biomechanics Studies,Injury Risk and Performance in Athletes

In this study, we present baseline data on device-measured physical activity, sedentary behaviour, depression, happiness, and satisfaction with life in newly diagnosed breast cancer survivors. Purpose: To examine associations of accelerometer-assessed physical activity and sedentary time with depression symptoms and prevalence, happiness, and satisfaction with life. Methods: Shortly after diagnosis, 1425 participants completed depression, happiness, and satisfaction with life measures and wore an ActiGraph® device on their hip to measure physical activity and the activPALTM inclinometer on their thigh for 7 days to measure sedentary time (sitting/lying) and steps (1384 completed both device measures). ActiGraph® data were analysed using a hybrid machine learning method (R Sojourn package, Soj3x), and activPALTM data using activPALTM algorithms (PAL Software version 8). We used linear and logistic regression to examine associations of physical activity and sedentary time with depression symptom severity (0–27) and depression prevalence, happiness (0–100), and satisfaction with life (0–35). For the logistic regression analysis, we compared participants with none-minimal depression (n = 895) to participants with some depression (that is, mild, moderate, moderately-severe, or severe depression [n = 530]). Results: Participants reported a mean depression symptom severity score of 4.3 (SD = 4.1), a satisfaction with life score of 25.7 (SD = 7.2), and a happiness score of 70 (SD = 21.8). Higher moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was associated with reduced depression symptom severity scores (β = −0.51, 95% CI: −0.87 to −0.14, p = 0.007). A 1 hour increase in MVPA was associated with a reduced odds of at least mild or worse depression by 24% (Odds Ratio [OR] = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.62–0.94, p = 0.012). Higher daily step counts were associated with lower depression symptom severity scores (β = −0.16, 95% CI: −0.24 to −0.10, p < 0.001). Perceptions of happiness was associated with higher MVPA (β = 2.17, 95% CI: 0.17–4.17, p = 0.033). Sedentary time was not associated with depression severity, but higher sedentary time was associated with lower perceptions of happiness (β = −0.80, 95% CI: −1.48 to −0.11, p = 0.023). Conclusions: Higher physical activity was associated with fewer depression symptom severity scores and reduced odds of mild or worse depression in women newly diagnosed with breast cancer. Higher physical activity and daily step counts were also associated with stronger perceptions of happiness and satisfaction with life, respectively. Sedentary time was not associated with depression symptom severity or odds of having depression, but was associated with stronger perceptions of happiness. © 2023 The Authors.

However, it is unclear how therapeutic localized vibrations alter BF. Low-frequency massage guns are advertised to enhance muscle recovery, which may be through BF changes; however, studies using these devices are lacking. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine if popliteal artery BF increases from localized vibration to the calf. Twenty-six healthy, recreationally active university students (fourteen males, twelve females, mean age 22.3 years) participated. Each subject received eight therapeutic conditions randomized on different days with ultrasound blood flow measurements. The eight conditions combined either control, 30 Hz, 38 Hz, or 47 Hz for a duration of 5 or 10 min. BF measurements of mean blood velocity, arterial diameter, volume flow, and heart rate were measured. Using a cell means mixed model, we found that both control conditions resulted in decreased BF and that both 38 Hz and 47 Hz resulted in significant increases in volume flow and mean blood velocity, which remained elevated longer than the BF induced by 30 Hz. This study demonstrates localized vibrations at 38 Hz and 47 Hz significantly increase BF without affecting the heart rate and may support muscle recovery. © 2023 by the authors.",arterial blood response; Hypervolt; percussion massage; vibration,adult; artery blood flow; artery diameter; article; blood flow velocity; blood flowmetry; clinical article; controlled study; female; heart rate; human; human experiment; male; massage; mixed cell culture; muscle; percussion; popliteal artery; randomized controlled trial; ultrasound; university student; vibration therapy; young adult,"""Effects of Different Therapeutic Interventions on Muscular and Neural Health""",Muscle Rehabilitation and Training Effects in Injury Recovery,Muscle Strength and Recovery in Sports Performance

This study aimed to characterize the barriers, facilitators, and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the rehabilitation process of people with dementia or cognitive impairment. Material and methods: An online survey directed to physiotherapists working in mental health collected data on the professional and training experience of the physiotherapists, as well as data on the population with dementia or cognitive impairment, and on the barriers and facilitators in accessing/obtaining results in physiotherapy in the pandemic period. Results: Sixty-three physiotherapists participated in this study. Three main barriers hindering these people in accessing or obtaining good results in the rehabilitation process were: (i) interruption of rehabilitation processes/restricted access to specialized monitoring in situations of prophylactic isolation; (ii) break in the routine of the person with dementia and caregiver; (iii) disruption to social interaction (isolation, distancing from their social networks). Regarding facilitators, the most important were: (i) greater proximity between people with dementia and their caregiver/family; (ii) intervention in the natural context of the person with dementia; (iii) greater proximity of professionals to the caregiver and the person with dementia. Conclusions: Barriers and facilitators identified in this study are crucial for physiotherapy interventions in different critical contexts (e.g., social restriction/ seasonal variations), and have an impact on the healthy lifestyle of people with dementia, including in physical activity promotion. © 2022 Sixteenth Century Journal Publishers, Inc.

The numerous research publications and International Olympic Committee consensus statements relating to REDs testify to the challenges faced in early identification or screening, diagnosis and management. Like sport, dance, in its simplest form, can be identified as an activity resulting in physiological energy demands and, as such, requires appropriate energy availability concerning energy expenditures. However, the specificity of physiological and psychological demands in dance must be considered when considering REDs. An environment where physical activity can exceed 30 hours per week and where culture may instil a value that thinness is required puts dancers at increased risk for REDs. The purpose of this study was to provide dance-specific guidance dance on this complex condition. An RAND/UCLA Delphi Panel method with nominal group technique was used to review the literature from REDs to evaluate how it may relate to dance. In addition to the EP, which was assembled from a multidisciplinary background with expertise in REDs and multiple genres of dance, six focus groups were commissioned. Four of the focus groups were drawn from the EP members and two additional focus groups formed by dancers and artistic leaders. These panels were used to guide the development of a RED-D diagnosis pathway, management plan and risk stratification and return to dance pathway. The dance-specific pathways are designed to be a practical tool for guiding and supporting clinicians managing RED-D. Furthermore, this paper represents an important focus of this area in dance and serves to stimulate discussion and further research within the sector. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.",,bisphosphonic acid derivative; estradiol; ferritin; folic acid; gestagen; leptin; nutrition supplement; oral contraceptive agent; somatomedin C; vitamin D; Article; biochemistry; blood cell count; body mass; bone density; bone structure; consensus; controlled study; dance injury; Dance Specific Energy Availability Questionnaire; dancing; decision making; Delphi study; diagnostic test; dietary intake; differential diagnosis; disease classification; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; face-to-face consultation; female; human; hypothalamic amenorrhea; information processing; injury; loss of appetite; male; medical expert; menstrual cycle; nutritional deficiency; nutritional requirement; questionnaire; Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport; resistance training; risk factor,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Even so, the responsiveness of those tests has not been evaluated after an instability training programme or analysed using multiple statistical indicators of responsiveness. The main aim of this study was to analyse the responsiveness of the stabilometry, mSEBT or EBT. Methods: Thirty healthy recreational athletes performed a 4-week programme with three weekly sessions of instability training of the dominant lower limb and were evaluated using stabilometry, mSEBT, and EBT tests. Responsiveness was quantified based on internal and external responsiveness. Results: EBT and all parameters in mSEBT for the dominant lower limb showed large internal responsiveness (SRM > 0.8). Furthermore, mSEBT values for the non-dominant lower limb (except anterior displacement) also experienced significant changes with an associated large internal responsiveness. None of the stabilometry platform parameters showed a significant change after the intervention. The ability of the EBT to discriminate between the dominant and non-dominant lower limb (i.e., trained vs untrained, respectively) was generally acceptable (AUCs = 0.708). However, none of the parameters of the mSEBT test showed an acceptable AUC. Conclusions: EBT showed a positive responsiveness after instability training compared to mSEBT, which only showed internal responsiveness, or stabilometry platform measures, whose none of the parameters could identify these changes.  © 2024 Sánchez Martínez et al.",Physical and rehabilitation medicine; Postural balance; Psychometrics; Sports,adult; anterior posterior axis; anteroposterior displacement; anthropometry; Article; athlete; balance disorder; body composition; body mass; body position; central nervous system; clinical article; clinical assessment; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; emery balance test; female; human; intervention study; kinematics; lateral displacement; male; modified star excursion balance test; monopodal postural stability test; outcome assessment; physical activity; physiotherapy; pretest posttest design; recreational athlete; spine instability; stabilography; training; treatment response; vertigo; young adult,"""Effects of Various Interventions on Postural Stability and Balance Control""",Postural Stability and Lower Limb Motor Control Studies,Evaluation and Improvement of Postural Balance and Muscle Strength

Design This was a retrospective analysis of fluoroscopic-and ultrasound-guided large joint aspirations. Logarithmic fit was performed to identify the presence of a learning curve to the successful attainment of fluid with experience. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify whether trainee presence for a procedure affected fluid attainment. Results Ultrasound did not demonstrate a significant fit to the logarithmic curve (P = 0.447), whereas fluoroscopy did (P < 0.001), indicative of a learning curve for fluoroscopy. After adjusting for covariates, joint fluid was successfully attained at a similar rate whether trainees were present or not. Significant independent factors related to successful joint fluid attainment were image guidance technique (P = 0.001), body mass index (P = 0.032), and joint aspirated (overall P < 0.001). Conclusion There was a statistically significant learning curve for fluoroscopic-guided joint aspirations, but not with ultrasound guidance. Trainee involvement did not affect the success rate of joint aspirations.  © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

With these characteristics, the effect of patient-related psychological factors on the CMS remains debated. We aimed to investigate which parameters of the CMS are influenced by psychological factors by assessing the CMS before and after rehabilitation for chronic shoulder pain. Methods: This retrospective study screened all patients (18–65 years old) who were admitted for interdisciplinary rehabilitation for chronic shoulder pain (≥ 3 months) between May 2012 and December 2017. Patients with unilateral shoulder injuries were eligible. Exclusion criteria were shoulder instability, concomitant neurological injuries, complex regional pain syndrome (including Steinbrocker syndrome), heavy psychiatric issues, and missing data. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Pain Catastrophizing scale, and Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia were administered before and after treatment. Regression models were used to estimate associations between psychological factors and the CMS. Results: We included 433 patients (88% male, mean age 47±11 years) with a median duration of symptoms of 392.2 days (interquartile range: 266.5-583.5). Rotator cuff issue was present in 71% of patients. During interdisciplinary rehabilitation, patients were followed for a mean of 33.6±7.5 days. The mean CMS at entry was 42.8 ±15.5. The mean gain in CMS after treatment was 10.6 ±10.9. Before treatment, psychological factors were significantly associated with only the pain CMS parameter: -0.37 (95% CI: -0.46 to -0.28), p <0.001. After treatment, psychological factors were associated with the evolution of the four CMS parameters: -0.12 (-0.23 to -0.01) to -0.26 (95% CI: -0.36 to -0.16), p<0.05. Conclusions: This study raises the question of a distinct assessment of pain when assessing shoulder function with CMS in patients with chronic shoulder pain. The separation of the “pain parameter” from the overall CMS score seems illusory with this tool that is used worldwide. However, clinicians should be aware that psychological factors can negatively influence the evolution of all CMS parameters during follow-up, which argues for a biopsychosocial approach to patients with chronic shoulder pain. © 2023, The Author(s).",Biopsychosocial approach; Chronic pain; Psychological factors; Shoulder assessment; Shoulder function,Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Female; Humans; Joint Instability; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Rotator Cuff Injuries; Shoulder Joint; Shoulder Pain; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult; adult; aged; Article; biopsychosocial model; chronic disease; chronic shoulder pain; collaborative care team; complex regional pain syndrome; concomitant neurological injury; Constant Murley (score); controlled study; demographics; disease association; disease duration; evolution; female; follow up; hospital admission; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; human; joint function; major clinical study; male; neurologic disease; pain assessment; Pain Catastrophizing scale; psychological aspect; questionnaire; recurrent shoulder dislocation; regression analysis; rehabilitation care; retrospective study; rotator cuff injury; shoulder function; shoulder pain; Steinbrocker syndrome; symptom; Tampa scale for kinesiophobia; treatment indication; unilateral shoulder injury; adolescent; joint instability; middle aged; rotator cuff injury; shoulder joint; shoulder pain; treatment outcome; young adult,"""Shoulder Joint Health and Rehabilitation: Arthroscopic Surgeries, Treatments and Outcomes""",Clinical Outcomes and Treatments in Shoulder Care,Shoulder Surgery Outcomes and Measures

Background: Athletic trainers have benefited from the 2 previous NATA position statements on concussion management, and although the most recent NATA position statement is a decade old, knowledge gains in the medical literature warrant updating several (but not all) recommendations. Furthermore, in various areas of the body of literature, current evidence now exists to address items not adequately addressed in the 2014 statement, necessitating the new recommendations. This document therefore serves as a bridge from the 2014 position statement to the current state of concussion evidence, recommendations from other organizations, and discrepancies between policy and practice.

However, conclusive clinical data on PJI caused by NTM are lacking. In this case series and systematic review, the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of NTM PJI are summarized and analyzed. Methods: From 2012 to 2020, we retrospectively analyzed consecutive PJI cases caused by NTM in our institution. A literature review was also conducted from January 2000 to December 2021, utilizing the PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases to identify all reported NTM-induced PJI cases. The clinical characteristics, demographics, pathogen identification, treatment protocols, and prognosis of NTM PJI were summarized and analyzed. Results: In this retrospective analysis, seven patients infected with NTM following total joint arthroplasty at our institution were included, including six cases of PJI caused by NTM and one case of septic arthritis (SA) caused by NTM. There were six men and one woman, and their average age was 62.3 years. The average interval between TJA and PJI onset was 4 months. The preoperative serological markers, including the mean ESR (51 mm/h), CRP (4.0 mg/dL), fibrinogen (5.7 g/L), and D-dimer (1.1 g/L), were increased. Six patients underwent staged revision surgery, and one patient with SA received antibiotic-loaded bone cement beads to treat the infection. After an average of 33 months of observation following surgical intervention, none of the patients showed any symptoms of infection recurrence. From 2000 to 2021, 68 patients with NTM PJI were found in 39 studies in the published literature. Reinfections occurred within 1 year after arthroplasty in more than half (53.2%) of the patients. M. fortuitum and M. abscesses were the most prevalent rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) in all PJI patients, whereas Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (MAC) was the most prevalent slowly growing mycobacterium (SGM). The corresponding antibiotics were amikacin and ethambutol. The rate of culture-negative without specific clinical symptoms was as high as 36.4% (12/33), while 45% (18/40) utilized additional diagnostic techniques such as NGS. A final clinical follow-up record was available for 59 patients (86.7%; mean follow-up period, 29 months), and 10.1% of patients failed to respond to treatment. Conclusion: Orthopaedic surgeons should consider NTM in patients with negative routine cultures who are at risk for Mycobacterium infection. Treatment options rely on the accurate result of microbiologic identification and drug sensitivity testing, and to achieve this, it may be necessary to send multiple culture specimens, extend the culture time, and change the culture medium. Every effort should be made to identify NTM and its various subtypes through modern diagnostic tools if necessary. © 2023 The Authors.

Methods: The period for this retrospective study was between December 2016 and December 2020. The criteria for inclusion were patients treated arthroscopically for an incompletely repaired massive RCT (dimension >5 cm and 2 tendons fully torn, intact or reparable subscapularis tendons and teres minor tendon with or without irreparable infraspinatus, a radiological Hamada classification between grade 0 and 4, and a minimum 24-month postoperative follow-up). Clinical outcomes were evaluated preoperatively and at a final follow-up by a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and range of motion along with the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (ASES), the University of California Los Angeles score (UCLA), and the Constant-Murley score (CMS). Radiological outcomes were assessed, according to the rotator cuff arthropathy (RCA) and the acromiohumeral distance (AHD) stages. Graft integrity and muscle fatty infiltration were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results: A total of 43 patients were enrolled in the study with a mean follow-up duration of 45.6 months (range: 24 to 64). All clinical scores also improved at the 2-year follow-up (mean: VAS 0.7 [SD 0.7] vs 5.4 [SD 1.1]; P <.001; mean: ASES 92.6 [SD 8.0] vs 34.8 [SD 13.4]; P <.001; mean UCLA 31.5 [SD 3.9] vs 11.0 [SD 3.2]; P <.001; and mean CMS 86.6 [SD 7.2] vs 40.0 [SD 11.6]; P <.001), and 39 of 43 fascia lata grafts were fully intact on MRI (91%). Conclusions: ASCR with a combined fascia lata autograft and synthetic scaffold patch graft resulted in good functional outcomes, with a high rate of graft healing at the 2-year follow-up.

Since conventional medicines can be associated with low effective rates and adverse events, pulmonary rehabilitation may be a promising non-pharmacological therapy for IPF. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the effects of full-body exercise-based pulmonary rehabilitation on patients with IPF by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Methods and analysis This systematic review and meta-analysis has been registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO). From inception to 31 August 2022, electronic databases in English and Chinese were searched, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials among the English databases. China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature, VIP Chinese Science and Technology Periodical, and Wan Fang Data were among the Chinese databases. Two independent reviewers then screened the potential RCT studies, which were analysed according to the Cochrane Handbook criteria. The efficacy and safety of full-body exercise pulmonary rehabilitation for IPF were evaluated based on outcomes, including exercise capacity measured by 6 min walking distance and quality of life measured by St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire. Lung function was measured based on the forced vital capacity, total lung capacity, diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide and dyspnoea assessed by the modified Medical Research Council scale. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was not required for this systematic review and meta-analysis. Results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at conferences.

These patterns are associated with poorer quality of life and premature death. It is believed that these patterns entail functional limitations, which may contribute to the fear of falling; however, this association remains unknown. Identifying this possible association is fundamental for developing individual and collective care approaches aimed at preventing the different patterns of chronic diseases in older adults in order to decrease the fear of falling. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between multimorbidity patterns and fear of falling in older adults. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study including 308 older adults. The exposure variables were the presence of three multimorbidity patterns (cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal, and vascular-metabolic) and pattern association assessed by self-report of two or more similar coexisting chronic diseases. The outcome was fear of falling assessed by the Brazilian version of Falls Efficacy Scale-International (cut-off point ≥ 23 points). Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze the association between variables. Results: Older adults with cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal, vascular-metabolic patterns and pattern association had 3.49 (95%CI 1.13; 10.78), 2.03 (95%CI 1.13; 3.64), 2.14 (95%CI 1.20; 3.82), and 4.84 (95%CI 2.19; 10.68), respectively, greater chances of presenting fear of falling when compared to older adults without the patterns. Conclusions: The presence of multimorbidity patterns is associated with higher chances of reporting fear of falling. It is emphasized that the introduction of public health programs aimed at preventing multimorbidity patterns is essential to reduce possible adverse health outcomes, including fear of falling and its negative consequences for older adult health. © 2022, The Author(s).",Accidental Falls; Aged; Fear of Falling; Independent Living; Risk Factors,Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Fear; Humans; Independent Living; Multimorbidity; Quality of Life; aged; cross-sectional study; fear; human; independent living; multiple chronic conditions; quality of life,"""Balance, Mobility, and Fall Risks in Aging and Musculoskeletal Conditions""",Impact and Control of Chronic Low Back Pain and Balance in Older Adults,Fall Prevention and Balance Improvement in the Elderly

We aimed to examine the association between GRF parameters during sit-to-stand motion and the incidence of frailty in older adults. Methods: This longitudinal study evaluated 319 outpatients aged ≥ 65 years with cardiometabolic diseases. The GRF parameters were measured using a motor function analyzer, in which the power, speed, and balance scores were calculated. Frailty was diagnosed using the modified version of the Cardiovascular Health Study (mCHS) and the Kihon Checklist (KCL). The independent associations between scores and frailty indices were assessed using multivariate binomial logistic regression analyses. Cox regression analysis was used to examine whether power and speed scores were associated with the incidence of frailty after adjusting for covariates. Results: Logistic regression analyses adjusted for covariates showed that the power and speed scores were associated with frailty according to the mCHS criteria (power: OR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.22–0.63; speed: OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.52–0.79) and KCL criteria (power: OR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.26–0.62; speed: OR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.69–0.96) at baseline. Receiver operating characteristic analyses revealed that the area under the curve values of power and speed scores for discriminating mCHS-defined frailty were 0.72 and 0.73. The Cox regression analysis showed that the speed score predicted the incidence of mCHS-defined (HR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.22–0.92, P = 0.029) and KCL-defined (HR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.60–0.99, P = 0.039) frailty, whereas the power score was associated with the incidence of KCL-defined frailty (HR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.55–0.95, P = 0.02) after adjusting for covariates. Conclusions: The speed and power scores measured during sit-to-stand motion are predictive of frailty in older adults with cardiometabolic disease. Therefore, the GRF parameters measured during sit-to-stand motion could be an important indicator of frailty. Further studies are necessary to examine whether the GRF parameters can be improved by exercise or whether the changes in these parameters are associated with the improvement of frailty status. © 2023, The Author(s).",Cardiometabolic disease; Frailty; Ground reaction force; Physical performance,Aged; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cross-Sectional Studies; Frailty; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Physical Functional Performance; aged; cardiovascular disease; cross-sectional study; frailty; human; longitudinal study; physical performance,"""Physical Activity and Health Outcomes in Aging Populations""",Physical Activity and Health in Older Adults,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Specifically, auxetics adapt to the shape of impacting bodies, while highly viscoelastic foams stiffen during severe impacts. So, we made auxetic closed cell foam sheets, including those that were infused with (highly viscoelastic) shear thickening gel (STG). We then undertook comparative quasistatic and impact (drop) tests. Quasistatic tests included compression, tension and indentation. Impact tests were with a flat faced impactor at energies of 1, 3 and 5 J, and a 50 mm diameter hemisphere at 1 and 3 J. Poisson’s ratios of the foams were obtained by optical full field strain measurement. An analytical model was used to separate the contribution of the various measured orthotropic properties during the hemispherical impact and indentation tests. The Poisson’s ratios of the converted foams (both with and without STG) were close to zero or marginally negative when measured through thickness. Planar values of Poisson’s ratio (measured in tension) were as low as −0.6. Through thickness Young’s moduli of the converted foams were 0.5 MPa, and planar moduli were ∼12 times higher. The auxetic foams outperformed the unconverted ones during the more severe impacts, exhibiting about half the peak force during the 3 J hemispherical impacts (2.5 vs. 5 kN). The reduction in peak force was related to a measured doubling in indentation resistance for the auxetic foam. The analytical model suggests that 7%-15% of the measured doubling in indentation resistance was due to (negative) Poisson’s ratio. Infusing the auxetic foams with STG caused, at best, a marginal reduction in peak impact force, attributed to low and non-uniform levels of infusion. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.",contact mechanics; Correlation; digital image; negative Poisson’s ratio; protective equipment; shear thickening fluid,Analytical models; Viscoelasticity; Auxetics; Closed cell foams; Contact Mechanics; Correlation; Digital image; Negative poisson’s ratio; Protective equipment; S ratio; Shear thickening; Shear-thickening fluids; Indentation,Advancements in Therapies and Technologies for Osteoarthritis and Joint Disorders,Therapeutic Interventions and Their Efficacy in Osteoarthritis Treatment,Advances in Tissue Regeneration and Healing in Musculoskeletal Disorders

Joint position sense (JPS) testing is a meaningful and responsive way to assess sensorimotor impairment for individuals who have sustained a DRF; however, there are factors that may influence the results of JPS testing, including kinesiophobia and pain intensity. Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the influence kinesiophobia may have on wrist JPS testing and if pain intensity impacts kinesiophobia and JPS in individuals with a DRF. Study Design: This was a cross-sectional study. Methods: Participants referred from two medical centers with a diagnosis of DRF treated with at least 3 weeks of immobilization were enrolled in the study. Data were collected at 1 week and 6 weeks postimmobilization period. Demographics were summarized with descriptive statistics, and linear relationships between kinesiophobia, pain intensity, and wrist JPS were examined using Pearson correlation coefficient. Results: Forty-eight participants were included in this study (mean age 42.9 years). Significant positive correlations were found between the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK) and Numeric Rating Scale (NRS; r = 0.951, p < 0.001), TSK and JPS error (r = 0.942, p < 0.001), as well as NRS and JPS error (r = 0.898, p < 0.001). These correlations indicate that higher levels of kinesiophobia are associated with increased pain intensity and greater JPS error. T-tests reveal no significant difference between male and female for the TSK, NRS, or JPS scores. Conclusions: There is an association for individuals with high levels of kinesiophobia and both greater pain and errors with JPS testing. © 2024 The Authors",Distal radius fracture; Joint position sense test; Kinesiophobia; Pain,,"""Pain Management and Musculoskeletal Health in Various Populations""",Chronic Pain Management and Treatment Studies,Management and Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

The study was carried out for 10 months and included 76 children (40 boys and 36 girls) aged between 6 and 9 years who practice recreational swimming in a city in Romania. Several tools were used: the Tapping test for manual dexterity, the Goodenough test for body schema, the Flamingo test for static balance, and the horizontal buoyancy test for body balance on the water. The results indicated better ratings on all psychomotor behaviors analyzed according to gender (in favor of girls compared to boys). The levels of all analyzed psychomotor behaviors have a direct relationship to the subjects’ age. Also, we identified moderate positive correlations for manual dexterity (rs = 0.63 in the front crawl style; rs = 0.57 in the backstroke style) and strong correlations for body schema, static balance and buoyancy, coordination with the learning of the two swimming styles (r or rs between 0.77 and 0.85).

However, it remains unknown if increased shoulder pain after an exercise session is a barrier for subsequent exercise dose, particularly in people with high fear-avoidance beliefs. Such knowledge could indicate ways to optimise shoulder rehabilitation. The aim was to examine whether increased shoulder pain across an exercise session was associated with a lower subsequent exercise dose, and if high fear-avoidance beliefs exaggerated this association. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study using data from a randomised controlled trial in Central Denmark Region 2017–2019. Participants were employees (n = 79) with shoulder complaints and high occupational shoulder exposures. The intervention was a home-based or partly supervised exercise programme lasting 2–3 months. Linear mixed models were used to examine the associations between change in shoulder pain and exercise dose (number of repetitions, progression level (1–3), resistance level (1–3), and time until next exercise session [days]). Results: At baseline, the participants had a median pain intensity at rest of 2 on a numerical rating scale (0–10). For a 1-cm increase in pain on a visual analogue scale (0–10 cm) during an exercise session, the subsequent number of repetitions, progression level and resistance level were − 1.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] − 3.4 to 0.9), 0.0 (95% CI − 0.1 to 0.0) and − 0.0 (95% CI − 0.1 to 0.0), respectively. Likewise, the time until next exercise session was − 0.6 (95% CI − 2.4 to 1.3) days for a 1-cm increase. There were no interactions with fear-avoidance beliefs. Conclusion: Increased pain across an exercise session was not associated with subsequent exercise dose, regardless of fear-avoidance beliefs, among employees with shoulder complaints and high occupational shoulder exposures.

From April 2014 to December 2017, 21 patients suffering from recalcitrant ITB friction syndrome were surgically treated with the aforementioned technique. 15 patients (15 knees) were available for a written retrospective reassessment after completion of a follow-up period of at least 12 months. Residual pain was scored using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The functional outcome was evaluated by two patient reported outcome measurement scales (PROMs), the Lysholm and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score. Return to sport was analysed by duration of the inactivity period as well as by the Tegner score. Overall satisfaction was evaluated using a modified Boyden scale. At final follow-up of one year, the performed intervention resulted in a pain reduction (VAS 4.2 (1-8) to 1.4 (0-6)) and improved knee function (Lysholm 59.53 to 87.73, IKDC 75) with return to sport (Tegner 4.3 to 5.4) after a median of 23.8 weeks (6 to 52). Twelve patients reported good or excellent results (80%) at final follow-up, and 12 patients (80%) would undergo surgery again, if necessary.

Study Design: A randomised sham-controlled trial. Place and Duration of the Study: Department of Sports Medicine, Yuzuncu Yil University Hospital, Van, Turkiye, from August 2019 to April 2020. Methodology: Patients with acute lateral epicondylitis were randomised into focused, radial, and sham ESWT groups. The ESWT was applied for three sessions at 2-4 days intervals. All the subjects were evaluated at baseline (week 0), week 5, and 13. Patient-rated tennis elbow evaluation (PRTEE) scores were used as outcome measures. Results: At weeks 5 and 13, all PRTEE scores (pain, function, and total) were remarkably improved in the focused and radial groups (p<0.001), but not in the sham group (p>0.05). Focused ESWT was superior to radial ESWT for the change of pain scores from baseline to week 5 (18.8±13.9 vs. 11.8±9.1; p=0.026) and week 13 (17.8±13.1 vs. 11.7±10.5, p=0.084). Focused ESWT was more effective than radial ESWT for the change of function scores from baseline to weak 5 (17.9±12.5 vs. 11.2±9.5; p=0.025) and week 13 (16.9±11.6 vs. 10.7±10.1; p=0.032).

While numerous reviews have explored the effect of exercise on these components in old age, these reviews screened and analyzed selected older adult populations, or specific exercise modes, thus providing only limited answers to the fundamental question on the effect of exercise on cognition in old age. This article describes the protocol for a systematic review and multilevel meta-analytic study aiming at evaluating the effectiveness of different types of chronic exercise in improving and/or maintaining EFs and long-term episodic memory in older adults. Methods and analysis: The study protocol was written in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Several databases will be searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in older adults aged ≥ 60 years providing any kind of planned, structured, and repetitive exercise interventions, and EFs and/or episodic memory measures as outcomes, published in English in peer-reviewed journals and doctoral dissertations will be included. Two independent reviewers will screen the selected articles, while a third reviewer will resolve possible conflicts. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool will be used to assess the quality of the studies. Finally, data will be extracted from the selected articles, and the formal method of combining individual data from the selected studies will be applied using a random effect multilevel meta-analysis. The data analysis will be conducted with the metafor package in R. Discussion and conclusion: This review will synthesize the existing evidence and pinpoint gaps existing in the literature on the effects of exercise on EFs and episodic memory in healthy and unhealthy older adults. Findings from this meta-analysis will help to design effective exercise interventions for older adults to improve and/or maintain EFs and episodic memory. Its results will be useful for many researchers and professionals working with older adults and their families.

The aim of our study is to investigate “Youtube®” videos about percutaneous tracheostomy in the intensive care unit in terms of the information value and quality they provide. Material and Method: Video search was performed on the “YouTube.com” in November 2021 with the “percutaneous tracheostomy” search key. The first 100 videos about percutaneous tracheostomy in the intensive care unit were listed and the number of views, likes, dislikes, comments, uploaded source, source country and continent were determined, and content analyzes were made. The quality, reliability and accuracy of the videos were determined by the ""Global Quality Score""(GQS), ""Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA) Quality Test"" and ""Modified DISCERN"" questionnaire, respectively. Results: According to GQS, 45 low, 31 medium and 24 high quality videos were detected. 72 of the videos contained insufficient, 25 partially sufficient and 3 completely sufficient data. Academic and doctor-sourced videos comprised the majority (70,83%) of the high-quality group. There was no significant relationship between video sources, GQS, JAMA score, Modified DISCERN score and the number of views, likes, dislikes and comments(p>0,05). A weak positive correlation was found between video duration and GQS(r=0,206), JAMA(r=0.263), modified DISCERN(r=0,388) scores(p<0,05).

Recent evidence suggests that similar neural mechanisms might be responsible for the increase in strength and skill observed in the untrained hand after unimanual training. The aims of this study were to: investigate whether a single session of unimanual strength and skill (force-tracking) training increased strength and skill in the opposite hand; measure ipsilateral (untrained) brain (via transcranial magnetic stimulation, TMS) and spinal (via the monosynaptic reflex) changes in excitability occurring after training; measure ipsilateral (untrained) pathway-specific changes in neural excitability (via TMS-conditioning of the monosynaptic reflex) occurring after training. Participants (N = 13) completed a session of unimanual strength (ballistic isometric wrist flexions) and skill (force-tracking wrist flexions) training on two separate days. Strength increased after training in the untrained hand (p = 0.025) but not in the trained hand (p = 0.611). Force-tracking performance increased in both the trained (p = 0.007) and untrained (p = 0.010) hand. Corticospinal excitability increased after force-tracking and strength training (p = 0.027), while spinal excitability was not affected (p = 0.214). TMS-conditioned monosynaptic reflex increased after force-tracking (p = 0.001) but not strength training (p = 0.689), suggesting a possible role of polysynaptic pathways in the increase of cortical excitability observed after training. The results suggest that cross-education of strength and skill at the acute stage is supported by increased excitability of the untrained motor cortex. New & Noteworthy: A single session of isometric wrist flexion strength and skill straining increased strength and skill in the untrained limb. The excitability of the untrained motor cortex increased after strength and skill training. TMS-conditioned H-reflexes increased after skill but not strength training in the untrained hand, indicating that polysynaptic pathways in the increase of cortical excitability observed after skill training. © 2023 The Author(s).

Design: Quantitative Cross-sectional. Participants: Twelve powerlifters with LBP and 28 powerlifters without LBP. Setting: Powerlifters were recruited in nine different cities and filmed while performing a movement control test battery. Main outcome measures: Lumbopelvic movement control test battery consisting of seven tests, with a possible score between 0 and 13. The tests were rated by a physical therapist blinded to the group allocation and comparisons of the frequency of current/incorrect tests between groups were calculated. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in the movement control test battery between the powerlifters with LBP (Median = 7.0, (2–11)) and powerlifters without LBP (Median = 6.0, (1–10)) (P = 0.59). There were no statistically significant differences between groups when the individual movement control tests were analyzed separately. Conclusions: The lack of significant differences between groups indicates that performance in lumbopelvic movement control test might not be associated with LBP in powerlifters.

Design: A prospective, 2-arm parallel, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Setting: Rehabilitation clinic of a private academic hospital. Participants: Patients (n=70) with frozen shoulder (freezing stage). Interventions: Participants (n=35) in the combination group underwent hydrodilatation and subdeltoid bursa injection with corticosteroid twice, mobilization, and usual-care PT for 8 weeks; participants (n=35) in the PT group received only the usual-care PT for 8 weeks. Main Outcome Measures: The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) was the primary outcome measure. The secondary outcome measures were pain scores on a visual analog scale, range of motion (ROM), the Shoulder Disability Questionnaire (SDQ), quality of life (evaluated using the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey [SF-36]), and self-assessment of the treatment effect. Results: Compared with the PT group, the combination group had significantly better pain (during activity), SPADI, SDQ, active and passive ROM, and self-assessment scores (all P<.001) as well as scores on some parts of the SF-36 (physical function and bodily pain, P<.05). Between-group differences were significant at the 1-, 2-, 4-, and 6-month follow-ups.

Materials and Methods: A total of 81 participated in this study. Participants were assigned randomly to four groups: control group (CON), low- (LSE), moderate- (MSE), and high-intensity strength exercise (HSE) groups. Three exercise groups worked out for 50 min/day, 3 days/week for 12 weeks. Results: In the thigh volume analyzed by computed tomography, the exercise groups showed a significant increase in the muscle mass, with a clear pattern of change observed in the groups who exercised with moderate to high intensity. The lowest levels of interleukin (IL)-6 in the MSE group (-20.94%) and tumor necrosis factor-α in the HSE group (-28.75%) were observed. Notably, IL-10 showed a significant increase (35.72%) only in the MSE group. In the CON group, natural killer (NK) cells showed a decrease, while in the exercise groups, their levels increased. The highest levels of NK cells were observed in the HSE group. Similar patterns of change were observed in CD4 T cells and CD19 B cells. CD3 and CD8 T cells exhibited significant increases in the MSE and HSE groups. Conclusions:: This study presents evidence that engaging in moderate to high-intensity exercise may have a positive impact on cytokines and immunocytes by increasing muscle mass in older adults who may have sarcopenia. Simple Summary: Engaging in strength training exercises is considered crucial for maintaining the health of older individuals who are susceptible to sarcopenia. When resistance exercises are performed at a moderate to strenuous intensity, it is anticipated that positive changes can occur in cytokines and immunocytes. These changes can be observed through improvements in thigh muscle volumes as measured by computed tomography. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Cytokine; Immunocyte; Muscle mass; Sarcopenia; Strengthening exercise,"Aged; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Cytokines; Humans; Interleukin-6; Muscle Strength; Muscle, Skeletal; Resistance Training; Sarcopenia; Thigh; CD19 antigen; CD3 antigen; interleukin 10; interleukin 6; tumor necrosis factor; antiinflammatory agent; cytokine; interleukin 6; aged; antiinflammatory activity; Article; B lymphocyte; body composition; CD19+ B lymphocyte; CD3+ T lymphocyte; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; cytokine release; female; geriatric care; high intensity exercise; human; human experiment; immune system; inflammation; low intensity exercise; lymphocyte; lymphocyte count; male; moderate intensity exercise; muscle mass; natural killer cell; natural killer cell count; protein function; randomized controlled trial; sarcopenia; strengthening exercise; thigh muscle; muscle strength; physiology; procedures; resistance training; sarcopenia; skeletal muscle; thigh","""Physical Activity, Rehabilitation, and Health Outcomes in Medical Conditions""",Impact of Exercise and Rehabilitation on Quality of Life and Health in Patients,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

There is a paucity of published evidence assessing patients managed with combined acute patellofemoral stabilisation and osteochondral fixation. The purpose of this study is to report the outcomes of patients with osteochondral injuries secondary to acute traumatic patella dislocation treated with combined early fragment fixation and MPFL reconstruction using a quadriceps tendon turndown technique which has distinct advantages for this cohort, including preventing chondral overloading and non-violation of the patella bone. Methods: Patients who underwent combined quadriceps tendon MPFL reconstruction and osteochondral fixation were included. Patient demographics, defect characteristics, complications and reoperations were evaluated. Patients were assessed with Lysholm, Kujala, KOOS-PF scores and satisfaction scale at follow up. Pre-operative MRI was assessed for presence of radiological risk factors for patella dislocation and post-operative MRI was used to assess cartilage quality with MOCART 2.0 score. Results: A total of 19 patients (63.2% female) were included. The mean age was 17.4 ± 4.8 years and patients were followed up at a mean 15.8 ± 5.1 months post-surgery. The mean defect size was 2.4 cm2 ± 1.3 cm2, with the most common defect location being the patella (13/19; 68.4%) followed by the lateral femoral condyle (5/19; 26.3%). At final follow up, the overall mean Lysholm, Kujala, and KOOS-PF scores were 84.9 ± 11.1, 89.7 ± 5.8 and 80.6 ± 13.6, respectively. Seventeen patients (89.5%) were satisfied with their outcome. The mean MOCART 2.0 score at final follow-up was 72.5. One patient required medial capsular plication with removal of a loose chondral body and microfracture and 3 knees required minor reoperations. Conclusion: Combined acute osteochondral fragment fixation and MPFL reconstruction using a quadriceps tendon graft offers good radiological and patient-reported outcomes with high satisfaction and low rates of recurrent patella dislocation. To our knowledge, this is currently the largest series of its kind in the literature and the results of this study provide a rationale for a combined approach using a quadriceps tendon graft for this cohort.

Lifestyle intervention strategies incorporating Tai Chi or conventional exercise have been shown to alleviate symptoms of insomnia and depression. However, the comparative efficacy of these exercise modalities in individuals with both disorders has yet to be determined. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of Tai Chi and conventional exercise for reducing depressive symptoms in older adults with chronic insomnia and depressive symptoms, when compared to a health education control. Methods: This study is a prospective, assessor-blinded, three-arm, parallel group, randomized controlled trial. Older adults aged ≥60 years with a diagnosis of chronic insomnia and depressive symptoms will be randomly assigned to a Tai Chi, conventional exercise or health education control condition on a 1:1:1 basis. Interventions will last for 3 months, with a 6-month follow-up period. The primary outcome is depressive symptoms, assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Secondary outcomes include subjective sleep quality, 7-day actigraphy, 7-day sleep diary, anxiety symptoms, quality of life, medication usage and physical function. All measurements will be conducted at baseline, 3 months and 9 months by outcome assessors who are blinded to group allocation.

Therefore, the purpose of this research was to investigate the effect of the STOP-X program on the knee valgus angle and static and dynamic balance in female basketball players with DKV defects. Methods: The present study was a quasi-experimental study. Thirty female basketball players with DKV defects were purposefully identified by the single-leg landing (SLL) test and were randomly assigned to two control (n = 15) and experimental (n = 15) groups. Static balance status was evaluated with the BASS STICK test, and dynamic balance status was evaluated with the Y-balance test (YBT). The experimental group performed the STOP-X program for 25–40 min for eight weeks (three times per week), and the control group performed their traditional warm-up program. Data were analyzed by means of 2 × 2 repeated measures ANOVA followed by post hoc comparison (Bonferroni) at the significance level of (P < 0.05) with SPSS version 26. Results: The results showed that with the use of the STOP-X program, there was a significant difference between the experimental and control groups in variables of the static balance (F = 56.45; P = 0.001; ES = 0.66, PC=↑59.64%), total dynamic balance score (F = 107.57; P = 0.001; ES=↑0.79, PC=↑19.84%), and knee valgus angle (F = 119.46; P = 0.001; ES = 0.81, PC=↓34.36%). Conclusion: In addition to reducing the knee valgus angle, applying the STOP-X injury prevention program can improve static and dynamic balance in female basketball players with DKV defects. Therefore, it can be recommended that sports trainers benefit from these advantages by adding STOP-X training to routine basketball exercises. © The Author(s) 2024.",Anterior cruciate ligament; Basketball; Injury prevention; Knee valgus; STOP-X,accident prevention; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament injury; Article; basketball player; cognition; controlled study; demographics; dynamic knee valgus; exercise; female; human; information processing; knee injury; leg injury; leg muscle; major clinical study; outcome assessment; post hoc analysis; proprioception; randomized controlled trial; rehabilitation care; resistance training; sample size; stop x training program; tendon; test retest reliability; training; valgus knee,"""Sports-Related Injury, Rehabilitation, and Performance Studies""",Rehabilitation and Assessment in Athletes with Chronic Ankle Instability,Effects of Training Protocols on Injury Prevention and Performance in Soccer and Futsal Players

ACL-r has several potential benefits over ACL reconstruction (ACL-R) including maintaining the native ACL innervation and blood supply, no graft site morbidity, and possible improved knee biomechanics and decrease in osteoarthritis. The purpose of this study was to assess for differences in metrics of knee joint loading during a single limb squat task between individuals following a primary ACL-r versus those who underwent a standard ACL-R with a patella bone-tendon-bone autograft. Study type Case Control Study Methods The ACL-r group [n: 15, age(yrs): 38.8±13.9] sustained a proximal ACL disruption that was amenable to repair, while the ACL-R group [n: 15, age(yrs): 25.60±1.7] underwent primary reconstruction with patella bone-tendon-bone autograft. At 12-weeks post-operation, both groups completed the IKDC questionnaire and biomechanical testing during performance of the single limb squat. Bilateral peak knee extension moment and total knee joint power as a measure of eccentric loading (contraction) during the descent phase of the squat were calculated on the surgical and non-surgical limb and averaged across the middle three of five trials. Participants also completed quadriceps strength testing on both limbs three months after surgery on an isokinetic dynamometer at 60°/sec. LSI (Limb Strength Index) was calculated for all variables. Separate ANCOVAs were performed on each biomechanical variable to examine differences between groups. Results The ACL-r had a significantly greater peak knee extension moment LSI (ACL-r: 78.46±5.79%; ACL-R: 56.86±5.79%; p=0.019, ηp2=.186) and total knee joint power LSI (ACL-r: 72.47±7.39%; ACL-R: 39.70±7.39%, p=0.006, ηp2=.245) than the ACL-R group. The ACL-r also had a significantly greater quadriceps LSI than the ACL-R group (ACL-r: 66.318±4.61%, ACL-R: 48.03±4.61%, p=0.013, ηp2=.206). Conclusions Individuals following ACL-r demonstrate increased knee joint loading symmetry during a single leg squat task and greater quadriceps strength symmetry at 12 weeks post-surgery compared to those who underwent ACL-R. © 2023, North American Sports Medicine Institute.

Specifically, we investigate whether OpenPose and any standard camera can be used to assess the quality of the Single Leg Squat Test and Step Down Test functional tests. We recorded these exercises performed by forty-six healthy subjects, extract motion data, and classify them to expert assessments by three independent physiotherapists using 15 binary parameters. We calculated ranges of movement in Keypoint-pair orientations, joint angles, and relative distances of the monitored segments and used machine learning algorithms to predict the physiotherapists’ assessments. Our results show that the AdaBoost classifier achieved a specificity of 0.8, a sensitivity of 0.68, and an accuracy of 0.7.

Changes in the midsole hardness (MH) of running shoes are an important factor leading to the alteration of the PF. This study aims to establish a finite-element (FE) model of the foot–shoe, and investigates the effects of midsole hardness on PF stress and strain. The FE foot–shoe model was built in ANSYS using computed-tomography imaging data. Static structural analysis was used to simulate the moment of running push and stretch. Plantar stress and strain under different MH levels were quantitatively analyzed. A complete and valid 3D FE model was established. With an increase in MH from 10 to 50 Shore A, the overall stress and strain of the PF were decreased by approximately 1.62%, and the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint flexion angle was decreased by approximately 26.2%. The height of the arch descent decreased by approximately 24.7%, but the peak pressure of the outsole increased by approximately 26.6%. The established model in this study was effective. For running shoes, increasing the MH reduces the stress and strain of PF, but also imposes a higher load on the foot. © 2023 by the authors.",biomechanics; finite-element method; foot–shoe model; midsole hardness; plantar fascia,,"""Lower Extremity Health and Biomechanics: Studies on Pain, Function, and Treatment Methods""",Lower Limb Biomechanics and Pain Management in Chronic Conditions,Gender Differences in Musculoskeletal Health & Physical Fitness

Research question: Which is more associated to postural control capability, the conventional toe grip strength or the newly devised toe pressure strength in the standing position, which is close to the actual movement? Methods: This study is a cross-sectional study. This study included 67 healthy adults (mean age, 19 ± 1 years; 64% male). The postural control capability was measured using the center-of-pressure shift distance in the anterior–posterior axis. Toe pressure strength in the standing position was assessed using a toe pressure measuring device to evaluate the force of pressure on the floor surface by all toes. During measurement, care is taken to ensure that the toes do not flex. However, toe grip strength in the sitting position was measured using muscle strength for toe flexion in a conventional manner. Statistical analysis was conducted by performing a correlation analysis between each of the measured items. Additionally, multiple regression analysis was used to examine the functions associated with postural control capability. Result: Pearson's correlation analysis revealed that the postural control capability was correlated with toe pressure strength in the standing position (r = 0.36, p = 0.003). Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that only toe pressure strength in the standing position was significantly associated with the postural control capability, even after adjusting for covariates (standard regression coefficient: 0.42, p = 0.005). Significance: The results of this study indicated that toe pressure strength in the standing position was more strongly associated with the postural control capability in healthy adults than toe grip strength in the sitting position. It has been suggested that a rehabilitation program for toe pressure strength in the standing position would help improve postural control capability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Postural control capability; Rehabilitation; Toe grip strength; Toe pressure strength in the standing position; Toe strength,Adolescent; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Lower Extremity; Male; Postural Balance; Standing Position; Toes; Young Adult; adult; anterior posterior axis; article; building; controlled study; correlation analysis; cross-sectional study; female; grip strength; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; multiple regression; muscle strength; rehabilitation; sitting; standing; toe; young adult; adolescent; body equilibrium; lower limb; physiology,"""Effects of Various Interventions on Postural Stability and Balance Control""",Postural Stability and Lower Limb Motor Control Studies,Evaluation and Improvement of Postural Balance and Muscle Strength

To measure prosthesis awareness throughout daily activities, the FJS-12 patient-reported outcome scale was developed. This article’s goal is to undertake a psychometric validation of the Italian FJS-12 among a sample of related THA patients. Methods: Between January and July 2019, data from 44 patients were retrieved. The participants were required to complete the Italian version of FJS-12 and of the WOMAC at preoperative follow-up, after two weeks, 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively. Results: The Pearson correlation coefficient between the FJS-12 and WOMAC was 0.287 (p = 0.002) at preoperative follow-up, r = 0.702 (p < 0.001) at 1 month, r = 0.516 (p < 0.001) at 3 months and r = 0.585 (p < 0.001) at 6 months. The ceiling effect surpassed the acceptable range (15%) for FJS-12 in 1 month (25.5%) and WOMAC in 6 months follow-up (27.3%). Conclusions: The psychometric validation of the Italian version of this score for THA was executed with acceptable results. FJS-12 and WOMAC reported no ceiling and floor effects. Therefore, to distinguish between patients who had good or exceptional results following UKA, the FJS-12 could be a reliable score. Under the first four months, FJS-12 had a smaller ceiling effect than WOMAC.

The severity of the AUD was assessed using the DSM-5 criteria, the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test, and the Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire. In logistic regression models, individuals with insufficient PA were more likely than other AUD individuals to present a higher Body Mass Index (p < 0.001), a higher number of AUD DSM-5 criteria (p < 0.05), more frequent opioid use (p < 0.05), higher scores at the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (p < 0.001), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (p < 0.001), impulsivity scale (p < 0.05), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory (p < 0.05), and lower WHO Quality of Life (p < 0.001) scores.

Purpose To investigate the joint profiles between cardiorespiratory and neuromuscular fitness and daily physical activity among PAD patients. Methods Cross-sectional study in a sample of 155 PAD patients. We measured their physical activity level per week using accelerometers, assessed their muscle strength through a sit-to-stand test and cardiorespiratory fitness through a six-minute walk test. Patients were categorized into three groups: those with high strength and cardiorespiratory fitness (NC, n = 28), those with at least one component classified as low (1C, n = 88), and those with both components classified as low fitness (2C, n = 39). Results The patients in the 1C and 2C groups spent less time engaged in low-light and moderate activities compared to the NC group (low-light: NC: 2291 ± 680 minutes/week vs. 1C: 1826 ± 649 minutes/week vs. 2C: 1885 ± 651 minutes/week, p = .005; moderate: NC: 2617 ± 796 minutes/week vs. 1C: 2071 ± 767 minutes/week vs. 2C: 2092 ± 776 minutes/week, p = .005) and the patients in the 2C group spent less time engaged in vigorous activities compared to the NC and 1C groups (NC: 155 ± 148 minutes/week vs. 1C: 110 ± 110 minutes/week vs. 2C: 64 ± 70 minutes/week, p = .003). Conclusion PAD patients with low strength and/or cardiorespiratory fitness are more likely to spend less time engaging in low-light and moderate physical activities and patients with low fitness in both components are more likely to spend less time engaging in vigorous physical activity. © 2024 Public Library of Science.

However, little is known about its muscle architecture in males and females. One hundred and nine physically active males and females were recruited. Tibialis anterior muscle thickness, pennation angle, and fascicle length were measured at rest in both unipennate regions of both legs using real-time ultrasound imaging. A linear mixed model was used with muscle thickness, pennation angle, or fascicle length as the dependent variables. All models were carried out with and without total leg lean mass and shank length as covariates. Causal mediation analysis was computed to explore the effect of muscle thickness on the relationship between fascicle length and pennation angle. There were no significant differences between dominant and nondominant legs regarding muscle architecture. Muscle thickness and pennation angle were greater in the deep than the superficial unipennate region in males (1.9 mm and 1.1°, p < 0.001) and women (3.4 mm and 2.2°, p < 0.001). However, the fascicle length was similar in both regions for both sexes. The differences remained significant after accounting for differences in leg lean mass and shank length. In both regions, muscle thickness was 1–3 mm greater in males and superficial pennation angle 2° smaller in females (both, p < 0.001). After accounting for leg lean mass and shank length, sex differences remained for muscle thickness (1.6 mm, p < 0.05) and pennation angle (3.4°, p < 0.001) but only in the superficial region. In both regions, leg lean mass and shank-adjusted fascicle length were 1.4 mm longer in females than males (p < 0.05). The causal mediation analysis revealed that the estimation of fascicle length was positive, suggesting that a 10% increase in muscle thickness would augment the fascicle length, allowing a 0.38° pennation angle decrease. Moreover, the pennation angle increases in total by 0.54° due to the suppressive effect of the increase in fascicle length. The estimated mediation, direct, and total effects were all significantly different from zero (p < 0.001). Overall, our results indicate that the architectural anatomy of the tibialis anterior shows sexual dimorphism in humans. Tibialis anterior presents morphological asymmetries between superficial and deep unipennate regions in both sexes. Lastly, our causal mediation model identified a suppressive effect of fascicle length on the pennation angle, suggesting that increments in muscle thickness are not always aligned with increments in fascicle length or the pennation angle. © 2023 The Authors.

Design: Electronic cross-sectional survey. Setting: Online survey platform. Participants: US licensed physical therapists that manage concussion. Main outcome measures: 1) practice patterns 2) knowledge/use of CPG 3) barriers/facilitations to CPG adherence. Results: Knowledge/use of CPG categories significantly predicted the model (χ2(1) = 10.966, p < .001) of total vignette scores/practice patterns with a statistically significant effect. A Kruskal-Wallis test indicated significant differences in total vignette score means based on knowledge/use between “not aware of the concussion CPG” and “integrated concussion CPG into practice” groups (p < .001, ES = .21). Knowledge/use of the CPG predicted the perceived barriers/facilitators model for three questions: investment in specialized concussion training (χ2(1) = 39.52, p < .001), necessary equipment to complete concussion evaluation (χ2(1) = 16.01, p < .001), and confidence around concussion evaluation knowledge (χ2(1) = 27.46, p < .001) with a significant effect. Conclusion: The results of this study provide support for guiding documents like the CPG to positively influence concussion practice patterns and insight into facilitators for guideline adherence. © 2022",Concussion; Guideline adherence; Practice patterns,Brain Concussion; Cross-Sectional Studies; Guideline Adherence; Humans; Physical Examination; Physical Therapists; Surveys and Questionnaires; Article; assessment of humans; awareness; cervical spine; clinical practice; concussion; cross-sectional study; demographics; dizziness; e-mail; economic aspect; educational status; health care personnel; health survey; human; human experiment; knowledge; linear regression analysis; neurology; orthopedics; physiotherapist; physiotherapy; practice guideline; protocol compliance; reading; reimbursement; return to sport; scoring system; social media; sport; thoracic spine; training; vestibular system; vignette; brain concussion; education; physical examination; protocol compliance; questionnaire,"""Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion: Studies on Impacts, Recovery, and Influences""",Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion Studies in Young Athletes,"Concussion in Sports: Detection, Effects, and Management"

This study tested the agreement between a markerless motion capture system and force-plate system (“gold standard”) to quantify stability control and motor performance during gait initiation. Methods. Healthy adults (young and elderly) and patients with Parkinson’s disease performed gait initiation series at spontaneous and maximal velocity on a system of two force-plates placed in series while being filmed by a markerless motion capture system. Signals from both systems were used to compute the peak of forward center-of-mass velocity (indicator of motor performance) and the braking index (indicator of stability control). Results. Descriptive statistics indicated that both systems detected between-group differences and velocity effects similarly, while a Bland–Altman plot analysis showed that mean biases of both biomechanical indicators were virtually zero in all groups and conditions. Bayes factor 01 indicated strong (braking index) and moderate (motor performance) evidence that both systems provided equivalent values. However, a trial-by-trial analysis of Bland–Altman plots revealed the possibility of differences >10% between the two systems. Conclusion. Although non-negligible differences do occur, a markerless motion capture system appears to be as efficient as a force-plate system in detecting Parkinson’s disease and velocity condition effects on the braking index and motor performance. © 2024 by the authors.",Bayes factor 01; biomechanics; Bland and Altman; braking index; force-plate; gait initiation; healthy adults; markerless motion capture; motor performance; Parkinson’s disease,Adult; Aged; Bayes Theorem; Biomechanical Phenomena; Gait; Humans; Motion Capture; Parkinson Disease; Braking; System stability; Baye factor 01; Bayes factor; Bland and altman; Braking index; Force plate; Gait initiation; Healthy adult; Markerless motion capture; Motor performance; Parkinson’s disease; adult; aged; article; biomechanics; controlled study; female; human; human experiment; male; motion analysis system; motion capture; motor performance; normal human; Parkinson disease; velocity; Gait analysis,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Wearable Devices and Techniques in Gait Analysis and Mobility Rehabilitation

Methods: Eight fresh-frozen cadaveric shoulders were tested at 60° of glenohumeral abduction in the intact, injury, and repair conditions. Injury conditions included 15% glenoid bone loss with an on-track or off-track Hill–Sachs lesion as previously recommended. Repair conditions included isolated BR, BR with remplissage, and BR with DAS (long head of biceps transfer). The glenohumeral stability was assessed by measuring the anterior translation under 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 N load and maximum load without causing instability at mid-range (60°) and end-range (90°) external rotation (ER). Maximum range of motion (ROM) was measured by applying a 2.2-N·m torque in passive ER and internal rotation. Results: Isolated BR failed to restore native glenohumeral stability in both on-track and off-track bipolar bone loss models. Both remplissage and DAS significantly decreased the anterior instability in the bipolar bone loss models, showing better restoration than the isolated BR. In the on-track lesions, DAS successfully restored native glenohumeral stability and mobility, whereas remplissage significantly decreased anterior translation without load (–2.12 ± 1.07 mm at 90° ER, P = .003; –1.98 ± 1.23 mm at 60° ER, P = .015). In the off-track lesions, remplissage restored native glenohumeral stability but led to significant ROM limitation (–8.6° ± 2.3° for internal rotation, P < .001; –13.9° ± 6.2° for ER, P = .003), whereas DAS failed to restore native stability at 90° ER regarding the increased anterior translation under 50 N (4.10 ± 1.53 mm, P < .001) and decreased maximum load (–13.8 ± 9.2 N, P = .021). Conclusions: At time-zero, both remplissage and DAS significantly reduced residual anterior instability compared with isolated BR in the bipolar bone loss models and restored the native glenohumeral stability under most translational loads. However, remplissage could decrease the anterior translation without load for on-track lesions and may restrict ROM for off-track lesions, whereas DAS failed to restore native stability under high translational loads for off-track lesions. Clinical Relevance: DAS could be recommended to treat on-track bipolar bone loss with less biomechanical adverse effects, whereas remplissage might be the preferred procedure to address off-track bipolar bone loss for better stability. © 2024 Arthroscopy Association of North America",,,"""Shoulder Joint Health and Rehabilitation: Arthroscopic Surgeries, Treatments and Outcomes""",Clinical Outcomes and Treatments in Shoulder Care,Shoulder Pathologies and Treatment Techniques

Methods: There were 3 stages to this study. First, a forward–backward translation method was used to develop a Persian version of the LTPAQ. In the second stage, the Persian version of the LTPAQ was evaluated for its face validity and content validity. Finally, test–retest reliability and known-group validity were assessed. The LTPAQ has occupational and volunteer activities, including travel to work, exercise and sports, and household activities. Frequency, duration, and estimated metabolic costs of activities with light, moderate, and heavy intensities were used to calculate the metabolic equivalent of each domain during life (in metabolic equivalent-hour/week). Metabolic equivalents of each domain and in total were used to evaluate the reliability and validity of the questionnaire. Results: In total, 60 people (41.7% females) with a mean age of 33.9 (SD = 11.5) years participated in this study. All domains showed excellent test–retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient > .9). All items had content validity indexes higher than 0.85. In addition, males had significantly higher physical activity levels than females (P = .022), indicating the known-group validity of the questionnaire. Conclusions: The LTPAQ was translated into Persian and trans-culturally adapted. This study indicates that the Persian version of the LTPAQ has adequate reliability and validity and can be utilized in future studies to assess physical activity in the Persian population. © 2023 Human Kinetics, Inc.",exercise; reproducibility of results; sedentary behavior; surveys and questionnaires,Adult; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Exercise; Female; Humans; Iran; Male; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires; Translations; adult; article; content validity; controlled study; correlation coefficient; exercise; face validity; female; household; human; human experiment; male; metabolic equivalent; physical activity; questionnaire; reliability; reproducibility; sedentary lifestyle; speech; sport; test retest reliability; travel; cultural factor; Iran; procedures; psychometry; publication; questionnaire; reproducibility,"""Physical Activity and Health Outcomes in Aging Populations""",Physical Activity and Health in Older Adults,Physical Activity and Health Risks

International evidence supports an exercise prescription for CRF. The majority of Australians with cancer do not meet recommended exercise targets. Aims: To analyse the effects of a guideline-based supervised exercise programme on CRF among a representative private hospital cancer patient sample (n = 268). Methods: We collected data from 268 patients recruited from haematology and oncology over a 5-year period. Participants underwent a 3-month CRF exercise programme based on internationally recognised exercise guidelines. The programme, conducted by a multidisciplinary team, operated twice weekly sessions of 2 h duration comprising aerobic, resistance and balance exercises; hydrotherapy and condition counselling; fatigue management; and dietetic, speech pathology and swallowing education (head and neck cancers). The effect of the programme was measured in relation to the following outcomes: Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy, Fatigue (self-reported fatigue); Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy, general quality of life (health-related quality of life in cancer); six-minute walk test; and Lawton's Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale. Results: Multivariate outcomes showed statistically significant improvements in all four major outcome measures, plus a programme effect of greater than 0.7 for each outcome variable. The programme treatment outcomes were consistent over the 5 years of the programme. Conclusions: The outcomes of this programme contribute to exercise guidelines in Australia. Currently only position statements exist on the subject, but there are no programme guidelines. An exercise prescription is critical to cancer outcomes. This programme is likely to benefit cancer survivors experiencing CRF across private and public hospitals in Australia. © 2022 The Authors.

Graduating nursing students face a variety of stressors, and entering the nursing profession during the pandemic adds additional stress. Using a quantitative cross-sectional design, mood, perceived stress, resilience, and coping were assessed in an Australian sample of 112 graduating nursing students, who completed the Brunel Mood Scale (BRUMS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4), and Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS). Mean BRUMS scores for tension, fatigue, and confusion were significantly above population norms and vigour scores were significantly below. Mean PSS-4 scores were reflective of population norms but showed higher levels of stress among younger and on-campus students compared to those who were older or studied externally. BRCS data showed that 82.1% of graduating nursing students were medium- or high-resilient copers. Mood profiles suggested that 19.6% of participants reported moods associated with mental health issues, 23.2% reported moods associated with risk of burnout, and only 17.9% reported mood profiles associated with positive mental health. High mean tension scores reported by graduating nursing students indicated apprehension about joining the profession, although stress, resilience, and coping scores suggested they were adequately managing the additional stressors generated by the global pandemic. © 2024 by the authors.",affect; coping; COVID-19; emotion; feeling; mood; nurse; stress,coping strategy; COVID-19; health impact; health risk; mental health; psychology,"""Impacts of COVID-19 on Physical and Mental Health, Exercise Habits, and Rehabilitation Strategies""","Impact of COVID-19 on Health, Physical Activity and Quality of Life",Mental Health and Physical Activity in Times of COVID-19

Achieving this is challenging with current bra solutions, sizing principles, and fitting approaches. Persistent wearing of an ill-fitting bra can cause negative health implications, including non-specific back pain. Objectives: This study investigated immediate and short-term biomechanical and pain responses to changing breast support garment among larger breasted women with non-specific back pain. Methods: Participants (n 5 24) performed a standing task, drop jumps, and seated typing tasks while bra and spinal kinematic data were recorded. Five breast support conditions were assessed: participants’ usual bra (control), a professionally fitted bra in the immediate term (standard) and after 4 weeks wear (standard28), and a bra with an alternative design, measurement, and fitting approach in both the immediate term (alternative) and after 4 weeks wear (alternative28). A bra fit assessment and clinical pain/disability questionnaires were included. Results: All participants failed the bra fit assessment in the control bra, compared with 87.5% (n 5 21) in the standard and 4.2% (n 5 1) in the alternative bras. The standard28 and alternative28 bras provided symptomatic relief, with the alternative28 bra improving a greater number of outcome measures. Reduced nipple-sternal-notch distance was observed only in the alternative28 bra condition. Conclusions: Symptomatic relief may be associated with the resting position of the breast tissue on the anterior chest wall. The alternative bra may provide potential clinical benefit if implemented as part of a nonsurgical or conservative pain management strategy. Alternative breast support garments should be considered to provide solutions to the problems associated with traditional bras. © 2023 The Authors.

Physical activity (PA) can attenuate these negative effects and improve quality of life (QoL). However, most cancer survivors fail to perform/sustain adequate PA levels, especially in the long-term. Theory-based interventions, using evidence-based behavior change techniques, aimed at promoting long-term behavior change in breast cancer survivors are effective, but remain scarce and fail to promote self-regulatory skills and better-quality motivations associated with sustained PA adoption. This paper describes the design of the PAC-WOMAN trial, which will test the long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two state of the art, group-based interventions encouraging sustained changes in PA, sedentary behavior, and QoL. Additional aims include examining the impact of both interventions on secondary outcomes (e.g., body composition, physical function), and key moderators/mediators of short and long-term changes in primary outcomes. Methods: A 3-arm pragmatic randomized controlled trial, involving a 4-month intervention and a 12-month follow-up, will be implemented, in a real exercise setting, to compare: 1) brief PA counseling/motivational intervention; 2) structured exercise program vs. waiting-list control group. Study recruitment goal is 122 hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer survivors (stage I-III), on AI therapy (post-primary treatment completion) ≥ 1 month, ECOG 0–1. Outcome measures will be obtained at baseline, 4 months (i.e., post-intervention), 10 and 16 months. Process evaluation, analyzing implementation determinants, will also be conducted. Discussion: PAC-WOMAN is expected to have a relevant impact on participants PA and QoL and provide insights for the improvement of interventions designed to promote sustained adherence to active lifestyle behaviors, facilitating its translation to community settings.

In addition, the Functional Movement Screen (FMS) score is a tool to assess body movement patterns to predict the risk of injury. Although various researches have investigated the relationship between the core muscle endurance and the FMS score, no study has ever assessed the effect of postural deformity on the FMS score. This study investigates the relationship between core muscle endurance and FMS scores in females with lumbar hyperlordosis. Methods: 42 healthy females aged 24.03 ± 4.4 years with hyperlordosis (> = 45/66 degrees) participated in this study. Core muscle endurance was assessed by the McGill stability test. Correlations were evaluated between the FMS score, McGill test, and lordosis angle using spearman correlation coefficients (p ≤ 0.05). Results: Most individual FMS scores were not correlated with the McGill test except stability trunk push up. Also, lordosis angle was not correlated with the FMS composite score (r=-0.077; p = 0.631), while it was negatively correlated with the McGill test (r=-0.650; p = 0.000). Conclusion: The lack of correlation between the FMS score and the McGill test implies that one’s level of core endurance may not influence their functional movement patterns. In contrast, the lumbar lordosis angle might impact one’s core muscle endurance but not their functional movement patterns. © 2022, The Author(s).",Core strength; FMS; Lordosis; Postural disorder; Stability,adult; article; clinical article; controlled study; correlation coefficient; cross-sectional study; female; human; lumbar lordosis angle; McGill Pain Questionnaire; muscle exercise; trunk; young adult,"""Balance, Mobility, and Fall Risks in Aging and Musculoskeletal Conditions""",Impact and Control of Chronic Low Back Pain and Balance in Older Adults,Evaluation and Improvement of Postural Balance and Muscle Strength

The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationships of pre-operative or postoperative cross-sectional area (CSA) of the thigh muscles with knee pain or patient satisfaction after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Methods: Twenty patients who had undergone TKA (3 men and 17 women; mean age 75.2 ± 8.7 years) were included. CSAs of the thigh muscle (THIGH) and quadriceps muscle (QUAD) were retrospectively measured at the CT slice 10-cm superior to the quadriceps tendon insertion at the proximal pole of the patella. THIGH CSA and QUAD CSA to body weight ratios (mm2/kg), THIGH/W and QUAD/W ratios, respectively, were calculated. Knee pain and patient satisfaction postoperatively were also quantified by patient-reported measurements based on the 2011 Knee Society Score (KSS). The correlations between the THIGH/W and QUAD/W ratios and the KSS were evaluated using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Results: The preoperative THIGH/W ratio was positively correlated with KSS-pain, (r = 0.58, p < 0.05). The preoperative QUAD/W ratio was positively correlated with KSS-pain (r = 0.52, p < 0.05) and KSS-satisfaction (r = 0.44, p < 0.05). The postoperative THIGH/W ratio was positively correlated with KSS-pain (r = 0.45, p < 0.05). The postoperative QUAD/W ratio was positively correlated with KSS-pain (r = 0.49, p < 0.05) and KSS-satisfaction (r = 0.48, p < 0.05). Conclusion: There were significant correlations between quadriceps or thigh muscle CSA and pain or patient satisfaction after TKA.

Others have disagreed, reporting that special tests were able to accurately detect the presence of rotator cuff involvement. Purpose The purpose of this study was to determine the knowledge, use, and perceived effectiveness of 15 selected special tests utilized to examine patients with possible rotator cuff dysfunction. Study Design Descriptive study using survey. Methods An electronic survey was returned by 346 members of the Academies of Orthopedic and Sports Physical Therapy through list serves. Descriptions and pictures for 15 special tests of the shoulder were included in the survey. Information regarding years of clinical experience and American Board of Physical Therapy Specialties (ABPTS) specialist certification in Sports or Orthopedics was collected. Respondents were asked if they could identify and use the special tests to evaluate dysfunction of the rotator cuff-and how confident they were in ability of the tests to diagnose dysfunction of the rotator cuff. Results The four tests most readily known by respondents included the empty can, drop arm, full can, and Gerber’s tests, and the four tests used regularly by the respondents included the infraspinatus, full can, supraspinatus, and champagne toast tests. The infraspinatus, champagne toast, external rotation lag (ERLS), and the belly-off tests were found to be the be most useful for establishing a diagnosis of the muscle-tendon complex involved. Years of experience and clinical specialization was not relevant to knowledge or use or these tests. Conclusions This study will allow clinicians and educators to understand which special tests are easily identified, regularly used, and perceived as helpful for the diagnosis of muscles involved in a rotator cuff dysfunction.

To understand the causes of football players’ injuries and how to recover sports injuries most efficiently, the football players’ injuries were managed and monitored throughout the whole cycle. However, the traditional football player injury cycle management and monitoring system are not only insecure in data storage, but more importantly, it lacks intelligent analysis of the collected data. With the continuous development of blockchain and machine learning technologies, blockchain technology is used to collect, store, clean, mine and visualize the full-cycle data of football players' injuries, and machine learning is used to provide intelligent solutions for football players' injury recovery. This paper compared the football player's injury full-cycle management and monitoring system based on blockchain and machine learning algorithm with the traditional football player's injury management and monitoring system. The experimental results showed that the average self-processing capacity of the football player injury MMS based on blockchain and ML algorithm was 70%, while the average self-processing capacity of the traditional football player injury management and monitoring system was 50%. Therefore, the application of blockchain and machine learning algorithm in the football player’s injury full-cycle management and monitoring system can effectively improve the system’s self-processing ability. © 2023, The Author(s).",Blockchain technology; Football player injury; Full-cycle management and supervision system; Machine learning algorithm; Support vector machine,Blockchain; Digital storage; Engineering education; Information management; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Sports; Block-chain; Blockchain technology; Cycle managements; Football player injury; Football players; Full cycles; Full-cycle management and supervision system; Machine learning algorithms; Management systems; Supervision systems; Support vectors machine; Support vector machines,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

Data on functional outcomes such as quadriceps and hamstring strengths, as well as patient-reported outcomes such as Knee Osteoarthritis and Outcome Score and visual analog scale were recorded. Results A total of nine studies comprising 417 patients were included in this review. There were no significant differences in quadriceps or hamstring strength measures between preinterventation and postintervention for both groups. Knee Osteoarthritis and Outcome Scores significantly increased from preintervention and postintervention in both control and exercise groups. Visual analog scale scores changed from 5.0 to 1.4 cm in the exercise arm and 3.1 to 1.9 cm in the control arm. Conclusions Strength-based exercise programs for patients postpartial meniscectomy did not result in significantly different improvements in quadriceps or hamstring strength compared with control programs. However, strength-based exercise programs resulted in significantly higher Knee Osteoarthritis and Outcome Scores and a greater decrease in visual analog scale scores.

Descriptions of physical activity levels in questionnaires usually rely on physical responses to physical activity. Therefore, we hypothesised that the validity of PAQs would be higher in the more physically fit group of participants. To test this, we conducted a validation study with 179 adults whom we divided into three fitness groups based on their cardiovascular fitness and age. Participants were measured for one week using the UKK RM42 accelerometer and self-reported their physical activity using IPAQ-SF, GPAQ, and EHIS-PAQ. We analysed the differences between fitness groups in terms of validity for each PAQ using ANOVA. We also performed an equivalence testing to compare the data obtained with the PAQs and the accelerometers. The results showed a significant trend toward higher validity for moderate to vigorous physical activity from the low to high fitness group as assessed by GPAQ and IPAQ-SF (low, intermediate and high fitness group: 0.06-0.21; 0.26-0.29; 0.40, respectively). The equivalence testing showed that all fitness groups overestimated their physical activity and underestimated their sedentary behaviour, with the high fitness group overestimating their physical activity the least. However, EHISPAQ was found to agree best with accelerometer data in assessing moderate to vigorous physical activity, regardless of fitness group, and had a validity greater than 0.4 for all fitness groups. In conclusion, we confirmed that when using PAQs describing physical responses to physical activity, participants' fitness should be considered in the interpretation, especially when comparing results internationally.  © 2023 Meh et al.",,Adult; Exercise; Humans; Sedentary Behavior; Self Report; adult; anthropometry; Article; body mass; cardiorespiratory fitness; European health interview survey physical activity questionnaire; female; global physical activity questionnaire; human; human experiment; international physical activity questionnaire short form; locomotion; male; middle aged; moderate physical activity; oxygen consumption; physical activity; physical activity questionnaire; questionnaire; sedentary lifestyle; self report; vigorous physical activity; exercise; sedentary lifestyle,"""Physical Activity and Health Outcomes in Aging Populations""",Physical Activity and Health in Older Adults,Physical Activity and Health Risks

However, no investigation has been conducted on BF EMG activity before and after BPA as calculated using a smartphone application (Nordic Angle app). HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE The aim of this study was to investigate the BF EMG activity before and after BPA, as calculated using the Nordic Angle app. The hypotheses were that BF EMG activity would peak near the BPA and gradually diminish afterward. METHODS After a warm-up, participants performed three repetitions of prone leg curls to discern maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) of the hamstrings. The peak value of the BF EMG activity during the prone leg curl was used to convert BF EMG activity during NHE to %MVIC. BPA during NHE was calculated using the Nordic Angle app by analyzing a movie recorded with an iPhone camera. Additionally, the knee flexion angle during NHE was determined using two-dimensional motion analysis software based on video data. To compare EMG activity before and after BPA calculated by the Nordic Angle app, the knee flexion angle was divided into seven phases: 10-15° before BPA, 5-10° before BPA, BPA ± 5°, 5-10° after BPA, 10-15° after BPA, 15-20° after BPA, and 20-25° after BPA. RESULTS There was no significant difference between the BPA of the Nordic angle and the knee flexion angle at peak BF EMG activity (d = 0.13, p = 0.678). The BF EMG activity at 20-25° after BPA was significantly lower than the BF EMG activity at BPA ± 5° (d = 0.87, p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS To prevent the recurrence of hamstring injuries, it is important to incorporate knee flexion exercises that enhance BF EMG activity at 15-35° of knee flexion (0° indicates a fully extended knee). Thus, it is recommended to keep the BPA of the Nordic Angle within 35° to effectively prevent recurrent hamstring injuries during NHE. © 2023, North American Sports Medicine Institute.

A total of 30 individuals (M = 69.5 years; 80% men) participated in this pre-post study that aimed to test a multi-behavioral intervention. All participants underwent standardized measurement of anthropometric variables, blood collection, self-administered survey, and accelerometer-based measurement of PA and SB over seven days. Serum BDNF concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. We applied separate multiple linear regression analysis to estimate the associations of baseline SB pattern measures, light and moderate-to-vigorous PA with serum BDNF (n = 29). Participants spent 508.7 ± 76.5 min/d in SB, 258.5 ± 71.2 min/d in light PA, and 21.2 ± 15.2 min/d in moderate-to-vigorous PA. Per day, individuals had 15.5 ± 3.2 numbers of 10-to-30 min bouts of SB (average length: 22.2 ± 2.1 min) and 3.4 ± 1.2 numbers of > 30 min bouts of SB (average length: 43.8 ± 2.4 min). Regression analysis revealed no significant associations between any of the accelerometer-based measures and serum BDNF. The findings of this study did not reveal an association of accelerometer-measured PA and SB pattern variables with serum BDNF in individuals with coronary heart disease. In addition, our data revealed a considerable variation of PA and SB which should be considered in future studies. © 2022, The Author(s).",,Accelerometry; Adult; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Coronary Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Exercise; Female; Humans; Male; Sedentary Behavior; brain derived neurotrophic factor; accelerometry; adult; coronary artery disease; cross-sectional study; exercise; female; human; male,"""Physical Activity and Health Outcomes in Aging Populations""",Physical Activity and Health in Older Adults,Physical Activity and Health Risks

As females are typically more fatigue resistant than males during isometric and low-velocity dynamic muscle actions, this study explored sex-differences in the muscle fatigue response to an EQI protocol. Twenty-five (n = 12 female) participants completed 4 unilateral EQI elbow flexions. Absolute and relative surface electromyography (sEMG) amplitude (iEMG, LE peak), mean power frequency (MPF), angular impulse (aIMP), and elbow angle were compared across repetitions and between sexes using discrete values and statistical parametric/non-parametric mapping. There were significant and substantial sex and repetition differences in absolute iEMG, MPF, and aIMP, however, males and females had statistically similar absolute aIMP by repetition 4. When expressed relatively, there were no significant sex-differences. Additionally, there were significant between repetition changes in sEMG amplitude and elbow angle with an increasing number of repetitions, largely in the first-two thirds of repetition time. The current study suggests that there are absolute, but not relative sex-differences in EQI induced muscle fatigue, and the effects across repetitions occur predominately in the first two-thirds of repetition time. © 2023 International Society of Biomechanics in Sports.",kinematics; SPM; Statistical parametric mapping; surface electromyography; time under tension,,"""Muscle Strength, Endurance, and Injury Risk in Upper-Extremity Sports Performance""",Muscular Strength and Injury Risk in Athletes,Muscle Strength and Recovery in Sports Performance

This presents a challenge to practitioners involved in delivering care. Objectives: To determine what bite impairments are associated with intra-articular TMDs, and explore how these impairments relate to self-perceived bite limitations and kinesiophobia. Design: Observational, case-control study. Method: Sixty participants (n = 30 intra-articular TMDs, n = 30 healthy controls) were recruited via convenience sampling. Bite function was explored using pain-free bite force and bite endurance/steadiness (submaximal bite hold) measures. Self-perceived bite function and kinesiophobia were evaluated via the Patient specific functional scale (PSFS) and the Tampa Scale for kinesiophobia of Temporomandibular disorders (TSK-TMD) respectively. Between-group data were compared and associations between physical bite impairments, self-perceived bite limitation and kinesiophobia were explored in the intra-articular TMD group. Results: Pain-free bite force was significantly impaired in the intra-articular TMD group (−108N, p < 0.01, d = 0.9), and this impairment demonstrated moderate association with degree of kinesiophobia (p < 0.01, r = −0.4). No significant between-group difference was observed for bite endurance or force steadiness (p > 0.05). No association was observed between pain-free bite force and self-perceived bite limitation, or self-perceived bite limitation and kinesiophobia (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Impaired pain-free bite force appears to be an important feature of intra-articular TMDs which should be considered within management. Kinesiophobia may be important to consider when assessing bite function in this subgroup.

However, there has been little investigation of what exercises are used and there is no sound evidence base to guide practice. This study aimed to develop a consensus-driven progressive muscle strengthening program for PHP. Methods: Thirty-eight experts were invited to participate in the study over three rounds. Round 1 was an open-ended questionnaire that provided the core characteristics of progressive strengthening programs designed for three different adult patient types with PHP (younger athletic, overweight middle-aged, older), which were presented as vignettes. In Round 2, experts indicated their agreement to the proposed exercises and training variables. In Round 3, experts were presented with amendments to the exercises based on responses from Round 2 and indicated their agreement to those changes. Consensus was achieved when > 70% of experts agreed. Results: Two experts were ineligible and 12 declined, leaving 24 (67%) who participated in Round 1. Eighteen (75%) completed all three rounds. From Round 1, progressive strengthening programs were developed for the three vignettes, which included 10 different exercises and three training variables (sets / repetitions, weight, and frequency). In Round 2, 68% (n = 17) of exercises and 96% (n = 72) of training variables reached consensus. In Round 3, only exercise changes were presented and 100% of exercises reached consensus. Conclusions: This study provides three progressive strengthening programs agreed to by experts that can be used in future clinical trials to determine the effectiveness of muscle strengthening for PHP. In addition, clinicians could use the programs as part of a rehabilitation strategy with the caveat that they may change as more research is conducted. © 2023, The College of Podiatry and the Australasian Podiatry Council.",Delphi study; Feet; Lower extremity; Muscle strength; Plantar fasciitis; Plantar heel pain; Strength training,Adult; Ankle; Delphi Technique; Heel; Humans; Lower Extremity; Middle Aged; Pain; adult; ankle; Delphi study; heel; human; lower limb; middle aged; pain,"""Lower Extremity Health and Biomechanics: Studies on Pain, Function, and Treatment Methods""",Lower Limb Biomechanics and Pain Management in Chronic Conditions,Tendon Rehabilitation and Treatment Methods

Changes have occurred in daily life as well as in all medical services. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the emergency accesses in four universities’ emergency services during the lockdown period from March to June 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out on 44,787 patients to evaluate the emergency services of university centers. The medical data of Medical Emergency Service Data (MESD) were assessed by five independent operators considering the epidemiological findings for statistics methods. RESULTS: A lower level of emergency access was reported in March-July compared to the pre-COVID period. The epidemiological data confirmed that female pathologies were more frequent compared to male patients. A fluctuation for almost all urgent healthcare centers was detected, showing one/two peaks per year during the years 2017-2019. The COVID-19 pandemic period did not influence the variety of pathology detected. CONCLUSIONS: After the lockdown period, the emergency services slowly increased in cases. The pre-COVID period showed an overlapping of the most frequent pathologies compared to the post-COVID period: periodontitis (Bari and Tirana), dental fractures (Bari and Bucharest), odontogenic abscess (Bari, Cluj and Tirana). © 2024 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

Methods: This was a quasi-experimental study with 37 adolescents with overweight/obesity (17 and 20 participants in the intervention and control groups, respectively). The program lasted 6 months, with three weekly sessions comprising physical exercises and nutritional and psychological orientation. The assessment of body composition, physical fitness, insulin biomarkers, and lifestyle indicators was performed before and after the intervention. The network analysis was carried out using three centrality indicators: proximity, strength, and expected influence; which identify the most influential or central nodes or edges, indicating their importance or crucial role in the structure and dynamics of the network. Results: Two networks, one each for before and after the intervention, were generated. Before the intervention, the results were as follows: for closeness, sex (1.059) and pubertal stage (1.268); for strength, pubertal stage (1.268), physical activity (1.160), and screen time (1.388); for expected influence, age (1.658), HOMA-IR (1.171), glucose (1.304), and waist circumference (1.394).

When interpreting quantitative rsEEG changes, a key question is: how much deviation from a healthy normal brain state indicates a clinically significant change? Here, we build on the existing rsEEG variability literature by quantifying how this baseline rsEEG range can be attributed to common but underinvestigated sources of variability: experiment day, time of day, and pre-recording exercise level. We found that even within individuals, frequency band powers and entropy measures can vary by 7% (sample entropy and relative alpha power) to 28% (absolute delta power). Absolute and relative delta power increased significantly after running, while relative theta power decreased significantly. Relative beta and gamma power were significantly higher in the afternoon compared to morning trials. Sample entropy and alpha power were relatively consistent. The coefficients of variability we found are similar to some clinical rsEEG effect sizes identified in prior literature, bringing into question the clinical significance of these effect sizes. Furthermore, time of day and activity level accounted for more rsEEG variability than experiment day, indicating the potential to reduce variability by controlling for these factors in repeated-measures studies. © 2001-2011 IEEE.",Frequency band power; resting state electroencephalography (rsEEG); sample entropy; within-participants variability,Brain; Electroencephalography; Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Brain; Electrophysiology; Entropy; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neurophysiology; Time series analysis; Frequency band power; Legged locomotion; Particle measurement; Power; Recording; Resting state; Resting state electroencephalography; Sample entropy; Time-series analysis; Within-participant variability; adult; Article; attenuation; clinical significance; correlation coefficient; degenerative disease; electric potential; electroencephalogram; electroencephalography; entropy; exercise; female; frequency analysis; human; human experiment; male; maximum walking distance; muscle action potential; neurophysiological monitoring; noise; pathophysiology; physical activity; probability; quantitative analysis; resting state network; brain; degenerative disease; physiology; Electroencephalography,"""Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion: Studies on Impacts, Recovery, and Influences""",Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion Studies in Young Athletes,Exercise and Cognitive Function in Aging Adults

It was originally written in English, which may affect its use when completed by nonnative English speakers. Purpose: To translate and adapt the ACL-QOL to Spanish and provide evidence of its psychometric properties. Study Design: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2. Methods: A total of 183 patients with an ACL injury from 4 Catalan hospitals were included: 99 patients who had undergone ACL reconstruction (ACLR) completed the Spanish version of the ACL-QOL (ACL-QOL-Sp) twice (mean interval, 15.2 days) in 2 weeks for test-retest reliability, and 84 patients completed the ACL-QOL-Sp, the Lysholm knee scoring scale, the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Tegner Activity Scale, and the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) before and at 4 and 9 months after ACLR to assess responsiveness. The association between the ACL-QOL-Sp and the other outcome measures was evaluated with the Spearman correlation coefficient. Results: The ACL-QOL-Sp showed good internal consistency (Cronbach alpha = 0.96) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.97). The standard error of measurement was 3.6, also suggesting the precision of measurements. The smallest detectable change was 9.98 in 94% of patients. No association was found between the ACL-QOL-Sp score and the Tegner score or SF-12 mental component summary score; however, a moderate correlation was found with the overall KOOS score (r = –0.545), Lysholm score (r = 0.509), and SF-12 physical component summary score (r = 0.607). The correlation ranged from weak for the KOOS-Symptoms subscore (r = –0.290) to moderate for the KOOS–Quality of Life subscore (r = –0.698). No ceiling or floor effects were observed. The ACL-QOL-Sp showed a moderate effect size (0.73) at 4 months but a large effect size (1.70) at 9 months. Conclusion: The ACL-QOL-Sp showed adequate internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and responsiveness in evaluating quality of life after ACLR in Spanish-speaking patients. © The Author(s) 2023.",ACL reconstruction; anterior Cruciate Ligament–Quality of Life (ACL-QOL) questionnaire; knee; reliability; Spanish version; validity,accuracy; adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; arthritis; Article; body mass; chronic pain; cognitive behavioral therapy; cohort analysis; construct validity; correlation coefficient; daily life activity; effect size; hamstring tendon; human; internal consistency; knee injury; Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score; lifestyle; Lysholm score; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; patellar ligament; patient-reported outcome; psychometry; quality of life; questionnaire; reliability; Short Form 12; social aspect; surgical technique; Tegner activity score,"""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction and Outcome Factors

AA are twice as likely to experience diabetes-related foot amputation due to foot ulcers, which are most often caused by high plantar pressure. While it is known that arch height, sex, family history of diabetes, Body Mass Index (BMI), age, and gait speed can impact plantar loading, there is a need to test the hypothesis that race in combination with the previously mentioned variables are significant predictors of plantar loading. To answer this question, plantar loading data was collected from 107 participants using an EMED pressure-measurement system (Novel Electronics, Inc, St Paul, MN, USA). Each participant walked barefoot at a self-selected walking pace ten times. Contact area, maximum force, and were force–time integral collected for each step on the pressure plate. A multiple linear regression was used to test if race, age, Arch Height Index (AHI), gait speed, sex assigned at birth, family history of diabetes, and BMI significantly predicted plantar loading. Race, age, AHI, gait speed, sex, and BMI were considered significant predictor variables for plantar loading. Most importantly, race was a significant predictor of maximum force in the hallux (β = 6.46, p < 0.001), rearfoot (β = -6.36, p < 0.001), and lateral midfoot (β = -2.72, p < 0.001), and the force–time integral in the hallux (β = 2.37, p < 0.001), rearfoot (β = -2.14, p < 0.001), and lateral midfoot (β = -0.65, p < 0.001).

Methods: The aim was to determine the association of non-contractile muscle tissue in the vastus medialis muscle, measured with routine MRI, with muscle extensor strength in patients with knee OA. Sagittal T1-weighted 3T MRI of 94 patients with knee OA, routinely acquired in clinical practice were used for analysis. Using the MRI’s, the amount of non-contractile muscle tissue in the vastus medialis muscle was measured, expressed as a percentage of (non)-contractile tissue, dichotomized into a low and a high non-contractile percentage group. Muscle strength was assessed by isokinetic measurement of knee extensors and by conduction of the Get-Up and Go (GUG) test. In regression analyses, associations of percentage of non-contractile muscle tissue with muscle strength and GUG time were determined and controlled for sex, age, BMI and radiographic severity. Results: A high percentage of non-contractile muscle tissue (> 11.2%) was associated with lower muscle strength (B = -0.25, P = 0.006) and with longer GUG time (B = 1.09, P = 0.021). These associations were specifically confounded by sex and BMI, because these two variables decreased the regression coefficient (B) with > 10%. Conclusions: A high percentage of non-contractile muscle tissue in the vastus medialis muscle measured by clinical T1-weighted 3T MRI is associated with muscle weakness. The association is confounded by sex and BMI. Non-contractile muscle tissue seems to be an important compositional property of the vastus medialis muscle underlying quadriceps weakness. © 2022, The Author(s).",Knee osteoarthritis; MRI; Muscle; Muscle weakness; Vastus medialis,"Humans; Knee; Knee Joint; Muscle Weakness; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Quadriceps Muscle; adult; age distribution; Article; body mass; controlled study; disease association; disease severity; extensor muscle; female; get up and go test; human; knee osteoarthritis; major clinical study; male; muscle strength; muscle weakness; musculoskeletal function; musculoskeletal system examination; musculoskeletal system parameters; non contractile muscle tissue; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; quadriceps femoris muscle; regression analysis; sex difference; vastus medialis muscle; diagnostic imaging; knee; knee osteoarthritis; muscle weakness; quadriceps femoris muscle",Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Gender Differences in Musculoskeletal Health & Physical Fitness

Despite the increasing accessibility of cannabis, there is limited guidance about its use and usefulness for autism. The purpose of this study is to query caregivers of autistic children about their experience, knowledge and interest in medical cannabis use for their children. Method: Survey methodology was used to query caregivers of autistic children between ages five to ten years. Informants recruited through a large children's hospital in New Jersey and the Autism Speaks website. Descriptive analyses of frequencies and percentages are reported and relationships among socio-demographic variables and survey responses were conducted. Results: Of the 4385 surveys sent, 568 responded. Informants were primarily white or Latino, female, and without a college education. Most were not familiar with cannabis use in autism; 7.2 % had experience providing their child with cannabis. Information about cannabis was drawn mainly from the Internet. Eighty-five percent of participants reported that they were willing to try cannabis for their child with ASD to address difficulty focusing, hyperactivity, sensory sensitivities, and anxiety. About half of those respondents were concerned about interactions between cannabis and current medications. Conclusions: Findings suggest a willingness among caregivers to use cannabis for their children with ASD, but a need for more informed guidance on this topic. More studies are needed to understand the utility of cannabis for autistic individuals; clear and reputable information about cannabis and ASD is needed. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",ASD; Autism; Cannabis; Caregiver; Knowledge; Survey,anticonvulsive agent; antihypertensive agent; benzodiazepine; central stimulant agent; medical cannabis; neuroleptic agent; noradrenalin uptake inhibitor; peptide hormone; serotonin uptake inhibitor; anxiety; Article; autism; cannabis use; caregiver; child; communication disorder; education; female; health survey; Hispanic; human; Internet; major clinical study; mental disease; New Jersey; sociodemographics,"""Physical Activity Interventions and Motor Competence in Children with Disabilities""",Motor Skills Development and Intervention in Children with Disabilities,Physical Fitness in Children and Adolescents

While the effects of it on performance and health have been extensively studied, less attention is dedicated to psychological ramifications of RWL. We sought to investigate the effects of RWL on mood states in judo athletes. Method: PubMed and Web of Science were systematically searched for the relevant literature. Only original studies investigating the magnitude of RWL in judo athletes while jointly using Profile of Mood States questionnaire were eligible. Results: Six studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Studies varied vastly in their design (time allocated to RWL and the degree of RWL), but the common trait in virtually all studies was a significant increase in tension and significant drop in vigor following RWL. It appears that when ≥ 5% RWL per week is prompted, mood states greatly exacerbate in judo athletes. Conclusion: Overall, data showed that mood states in judo athletes are aggravated after ≥ 5% RWL with no significant difference between males and females. Future studies should explore the long-term effects of weight cycling on the mental health of judo athletes and other athletes participating in weight-classified sports. © 2023 The Author(s)",Anger; Confusion; Depression; Fatigue; Mood states; Tension; Vigor; Weight cycling,,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Effects of different training methods on athletic performance and injury prevention

This study aimed to determine and compare the benefits of AE and land-based exercise (LBE) on pain, functionality, and quality of life after arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM). Methods: This randomized controlled study included 30 middle-aged (35–50), physically active patients who were randomized into LBE (n = 15) and AE (n = 15) groups after APM for a degenerative meniscal tear. Visual analogue scale (VAS), Short Form-36 (SF-36), single-leg hop test and Lysholm questionnaire scores in addition to isokinetic muscle strength values were evaluated at baseline, at fourth week immediately after cessation of exercise program and at eighth week follow-up visits. The exercise sessions were conducted in 1-h sessions per day, three days a week for a total of four weeks. Results: Significant improvement was observed in the VAS, single-leg hop test, Lysholm questionnaire, and most of SF-36 subscale scores in both groups at both fourth and eighth follow-ups. Isokinetic dynamometer revealed significant improvement in the peak torque values for extension at angular velocities of 60° and 180° at both follow-ups in the AE group. LBE group showed significant improvement in the peak torque value for extension only at an angular velocity of 60° only at fourth week follow-up. There was no significant difference between groups for any of these parameters at any of the follow-ups. Conclusion: Both AE and LBE programs had significantly improved pain, function, isokinetic muscle strength, and quality of life in patients after APM. Either type of exercise is essential as part of the rehabilitation protocol for good clinical outcomes after APM and should not be neglected (level II).

Methods: Forty-six SSc patients were randomly separated into two groups as telerehabilitation and control. Videos comprising clinical Pilates-based exercises were designed and uploaded to YouTube™ for the telerehabilitation group by physiotherapists. A video interview was conducted with the SSc patients once a week and an exercise program was performed twice daily for 8 weeks in the telerehabilitation group. The same exercise programs were printed on paper brochures and patients were instructed on their application in the form of a home exercise program to be continued for 8 weeks in the control group. Pain, fatigue, quality of life, sleep, physical activity, anxiety, and depression were assessed in all patients at the beginning and end of the study. Results: The clinical and demographic characteristics were similar in both groups (p > 0.05). Fatigue, pain, anxiety, and depression decreased in both groups, while quality of life and sleep quality increased after the exercise program (p < 0.05). However, the improvements in the telerehabilitation group were statistically more significant than in the control group for all studied parameters (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The results of our study demonstrate the superior efficacy of telerehabilitation-based treatment programs over home exercise programs, hence, we suggest widespread use of this innovative treatment program in SSc patients. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature 2023.",Fatigue; Physiotherapy; Rehabilitation; Telemedicine; YouTube,"Exercise; Exercise Therapy; Fatigue; Humans; Pain; Quality of Life; Scleroderma, Systemic; Telerehabilitation; adult; anxiety; Article; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; daily life activity; disease duration; exercise; experimental therapy; female; follow up; Health Assessment Questionnaire; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; human; informed consent; institutional ethics; international physical activity questionnaire; male; Nottingham Health Profile; pain intensity; physical activity; physiotherapist; physiotherapy; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; quality of life; sleep quality; social media; systemic sclerosis; telemedicine; telerehabilitation; video interview; workflow; exercise; fatigue; kinesiotherapy; pain; procedures; systemic sclerosis",Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Management and Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

Methods: This multicenter randomized controlled trial compared standard hamstring tendon ACLR with combined ACLR and LET using a strip of the iliotibial band (modified Lemaire technique). Patients aged 25 years or younger with an anterior cruciate ligament–deficient knee were included. Patients also had to meet 2 of the following criteria: (1) pivot-shift grade 2 or greater, (2) participation in a high-risk or pivoting sport, and (3) generalized ligamentous laxity. Time to return and level of RTS were determined via administration of a questionnaire at 24 months postoperatively. Results: We randomized 618 patients in this study, 553 of whom played high-risk sports preoperatively. The proportion of patients who did not RTS was similar between the ACLR (11%) and ACLR-LET (14%) groups; however, the graft rupture rate was significantly different (11.2% in ACLR group vs 4.1% in ACLR-LET group, P =.004). The most cited reason for no RTS was lack of confidence and/or fear of reinjury. A stable knee was associated with nearly 2 times greater odds of returning to a high-level high-risk sport postoperatively (odds ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-3.35; P =.02). There were no significant differences in patient-reported functional outcomes or hop test results between groups (P >.05). Patients who returned to high-risk sports had better hamstring symmetry than those who did not RTS (P =.001). Conclusions: At 24 months postoperatively, patients who underwent ACLR plus LET had a similar RTS rate to those who underwent ACLR alone. Although the subgroup analysis did not show a statistically significant increase in RTS with the addition of LET, on returning, the addition of LET kept subjects playing longer by reducing graft failure rates.

Many studies have focused on evaluating the physical activity (PA) level, while evaluation of SB has received less attention. The main goal of the present study is to describe the sedentary lifestyle of the Hungarian adult population and identify the vulnerable groups with high amount of sitting time and the patterns of SB. Another aim of this study is to compare the two types of questionnaires (International Physical Activity Questionnaire—IPAQ and Sedentary Behavior Questionnaire—SBQ) related to sitting time. Methods: This study analyzed cross-sectional primary data using self-reported questionnaires collected by a Hungarian research market company among the adult population in Hungary. The final sample of this study consisted of 1295 participants with a mean age of 45.9 years (SD = 15.2). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) test with post-hoc (Tukey) analysis were used to analyze the link between sitting time and socio-demographic variables (sex, age, BMI, settlement type, education level, marital status, work category, working hours, employment status, sport activity) and body mass index (BMI). Results and conclusions: According to the SBQ, on average, Hungarians sit for 469.53 min per day (7.81 h) on weekdays and 421.25 min per day (7.01 h) on weekends, which suggested a significant difference compared to IPAQ data: 287.82 min per day (4.79 h) on weekdays and 224.30 min per day (3.73 h) on weekends. Young people (aged between 18 and 29) were reported to have the highest average sitting time, i.e., 545 min per day (more than 9 h), and are showing the highest prevalence (53%) of sitting at least 480 min (8 h) per day. Sitting workers also had a high average sitting time, i.e., 514.82 min per day, and a high prevalence (49.3%) of sitting at least 480 min (8 h) per day. People who live in the capital city had higher sitting time, especially on working days. Men sat longer than woman, i.e., 19 min on working days and 45 min on weekends. The most frequent sedentary activities are: working on computer (126 min) on working days and watching TV (130 min) on weekends. Our results clearly show that the self-report single-item measure (IPAQ) significantly underestimates sedentary time compared to the multi-item questionnaire (SBQ). We identified vulnerable groups with high sitting times: men, young adults, inhabitants of the capital city and sitting workers. Consequently, these groups should be continuously surveyed, and requires specific interventions and strategies that particularly counteract the increased sitting time. © 2023 by the authors.",IPAQ; NCDs; physical inactivity; SBQ; sedentary lifestyle; sitting time,Adolescent; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Hungary; Male; Middle Aged; Sedentary Behavior; Self Report; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult; adult; lifestyle; physical activity; population dynamics; public health; adult; analysis of variance; Article; body mass; controlled study; cross-sectional study; education; employment; female; human; Hungarian (citizen); Hungary; international physical activity questionnaire; male; marriage; middle aged; occupation; population research; post hoc analysis; prevalence; questionnaire; Sedentary Behavior Questionnaire; sedentary lifestyle; sedentary time; self report; sex difference; sociodemographics; sport; television viewing; Turkey (republic); urban population; vulnerable population; working time; young adult; adolescent,"""Physical Activity and Health Outcomes in Aging Populations""",Physical Activity and Health in Older Adults,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

The aims of this study were to determine whether older adults, who participated in ERAA exercise classes experienced a change in physical function, and identify factors associated with this change. Methods: Participants included community-dwelling older adults, aged ≥ 65 years, from every state and territory of Australia. The ERAA program included 12 subsidised, weekly, low- to moderate-intensity exercise classes, delivered by accredited exercise scientists or physiologists (AESs/AEPs). Primary outcomes included the 30 s Sit-to-Stand (STS) and the 3-metre Timed Up and Go (TUG) tests. Secondary outcomes included grip strength, the Chair Sit and Reach test, and waist circumference. Linear mixed-effects regression models were used to evaluate the change in outcomes following program completion, and to determine factors associated with changes in the primary outcomes. Results: 3,582 older adults (77% female) with a median (IQR) age of 72 (69–77) years completed follow-up testing. For all primary and secondary outcomes, there was a statistically significant improvement after program completion (p < 0.001). The STS increased by 2.2 repetitions (95% CI: 2.1, 2.3), the TUG decreased by 0.9 s (95% CI: -1.0, -0.8), right and left grip strength increased by 1.3 kg (95% CI: 1.2, 1.5) and 1.5 kg (95% CI: 1.3, 1.6), respectively, right and left reach increased by 1.7 cm (95% CI: 1.4, 2.0), and waist circumference decreased by 1.2 cm (95% CI: -1.4, -1.1). Greater improvements in STS were observed for participants aged 65–69 years, females, and those with greater socio-economic disadvantage. For the TUG, greater improvements were observed in participants reporting 2 + comorbidities, and residing in outer regional areas and areas with greater socio-economic disadvantage. Conclusions: Participation of older Australians in the ERAA program, led to statistically significant improvements in physical function. The program reached a large number of older Australians from every state and territory, including those from regional and remote parts of Australia, aged over 85 years, and with high levels of comorbidity, which supports the feasibility and acceptability of AES- and AEP-led exercise classes amongst community-dwelling older Australians.

Methods: Information of 426 patients treated by early applicated percutaneous endoscopic interlaminar discectomy (PEID) for lumbar disc herniation (LDH) at our hospital from June 2017 to October 2021 in addition to 17 other features was collected. The risk factors were selected by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method (LASSO) regression. Then, a prediction model (nomogram) was established to predict the unfavourable outcomes of using the risk factors selected from LASSO regression. Bootstrap (n = 1000) was used to perform the internal validation, and the performance of the model was assessed by the concordance index (C-index), receiver operating characteristic curve, and calibration curve. The decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curve (CIC) were used to assess the clinical utility of the model, respectively. Results: Finally, 53 of 426 patients showed unfavourable outcomes. Five potential factors, Modic change, Calcification, Lumbar epidural steroid injection preoperative, Articular process hyperplasia and cohesion, and Laminoplasty technique, were selected according to the LASSO regression, that identified the predictors to establish nomogram model. Meanwhile, the C-index of the prediction nomogram was 0.847, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value was 0.847, and the interval bootstrapping (n = 1000) validation C-index was 0.809. The model has good practicability for clinics according to the DCA and CIC. Conclusion: This nomogram model has good predictive performance and clinical practicability, which could provide a certain basis for predicting unfavourable outcomes of early applicated PEID for LDH. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.",Lumbar disc herniation; Nomogram; Percutaneous endoscopic interlaminar discectomy; Unfavourable outcome,"Diskectomy, Percutaneous; Endoscopy; Humans; Intervertebral Disc Displacement; Lumbar Vertebrae; Nomograms; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; steroid; adult; aged; Article; bootstrapping; clinical outcome; concordance index; controlled study; discectomy; endoscopy; female; fluoroscopy; human; hyperplasia; laminoplasty; least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; lumbar disk hernia; major clinical study; male; nerve root; nomogram; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; percutaneous endoscopic interlaminar discectomy; preoperative treatment; receiver operating characteristic; risk factor; spinal cord decompression; statistical concepts; intervertebral disk hernia; lumbar vertebra; nomogram; percutaneous discectomy; procedures; retrospective study; treatment outcome","""Studies and Analysis on Knee Surgery and Rehabilitation""",Knee Injury Rehabilitation and Treatment Outcomes,Evaluation and Improvement of Postural Balance and Muscle Strength

Methods: A literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library was performed based on the PRISMA guidelines. Studies evaluating the outcomes of athletes with primary anterior shoulder dislocation were included. Return to play and subsequent recurrent instability were evaluated. Results: Twenty-two studies with 1,310 patients were included. The mean age of included patients was 30.1 years, 83.1% were male, and the mean follow-up was 68.9 months. Overall, 76.5% were able to return to play, with 51.5% able to return to play at their pre-injury level. The pooled recurrence rate was 54.7%, with best-case and worst-case analysis revealing the recurrence rate to be between 50.7% to 67.7% in those able to return to play. Among collision athletes, 88.1% were able to return to play, with 78.7% experiencing a recurrent instability event. Conclusion: The current study demonstrates that nonoperative management of athletes with primary anterior shoulder dislocation results in a low rate of success. While the majority of athletes are able to return to play, there is a low rate of return to their pre-injury level of play, and there is a high rate of recurrent instability. © 2023, J.

Second, to identify prognostic indicators of failure of transition to barefoot running. Methods Over 20 wk, 76 healthy runners (female, 40; age, 35.04 yr [SD, 8.9 yr]; body weight, 69.9 kg [SD 13.4 kg]) attempted to transition from running in traditional shoes to running barefoot. A minimalist shoe was used as an intermediary. Participants ran for 4 wk exclusively in provided traditional shoes followed by 4 wk of transitioning to minimalist shoes. This process was repeated to transition to barefoot running. Participants were followed up until they withdrew from the study or successfully transitioned to running barefoot. A survival analysis examined the weeks of successful transition. Along with sex and age, baseline measures of traditional shoe overall comfort, footstrike pattern, midfoot width mobility and plantar foot pressure pain threshold were examined as prognostic variables for failure to transition using Cox regression. Results The cumulative probability of successful transition to running barefoot was 70.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 61%-83%). The primary footwear-related reason for withdrawal was pain, primarily in the foot (n = 7), two runners had confirmed injuries. Runners exhibiting a rearfoot strike pattern and higher midfoot width mobility were more likely to fail to transition (hazard ratios [HR], 4.02; 95% CI, 1.33-12.16 and HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.05-1.42). Conclusions Most runners who wish to run barefoot will be able to transition. Our study indicates that there may be biomechanical and anatomical characteristics that are prognostic of failing to transition when using a 20-wk transition period and an intermediary minimalist shoe. Whether a different transition process increases the probability of a success remains to be seen.

Dehydration has deleterious effects on physical and cognitive function, which may increase the risk of injury. The purpose of the study was to investigate whether the degree of weight cutting was associated with injury risk. Methods Data were collected prospectively in a cohort of collegiate wrestlers over seven seasons. Changes in weight, body fat and lean mass were measured during the preseason, at midseason and before competition. Cox proportional-hazard ratios were calculated for risk of in-competition injury. Results Among 67 unique division 1 collegiate wrestlers (163 athlete seasons), there were 53 unique injuries affecting 46 athletes. There was no difference in absolute weight change, per cent weight change, per cent body fat change or per cent lean mass change between injured and non-injured wrestlers from the preseason to midseason measurements. From midseason to competition weight, change in body weight was -7.0%±3.2% (-5.3 kg±2.6) in injured athletes compared with -5.7%±3.3% (-4.3 kg±2.5) in non-injured athletes. For every kilogram of body weight lost, wrestlers had a 14% increased hazard of injury (HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.25, p=0.004). For every 1% of body weight lost, wrestlers had an 11% increased hazard of injury (HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.19, p=0.005). Conclusion Rapid weight cutting was associated with a higher risk of in-competition injuries in division 1 collegiate wrestlers. For every per cent in body weight lost, wrestlers had an 11% increased hazard of injury during competition.  © 2022 British Journal of Ophthalmology.

A total of 763 collegiate female football players from seven teams belonging to Kanto University Women Football Association Division 1 in 2013–2015 seasons were included in the study. At the start of the study, 235 players were assigned to a FIFA 11+ intervention group (four teams, 115 players) and a control group (three teams, 120 players). The intervention period was set to three seasons, and the players were followed up during this period. The one-season effect of the FIFA 11+ was investigated after each season. The effect of continuous intervention was verified in 66 and 62 players from the intervention and control groups who continued the study for all three seasons, respectively. The one-season intervention showed significantly lower total, ankle, knee, sprain, ligament injury, noncontact, moderate and severe injury incidence rates in the intervention group in each season. Regarding the continuous intervention, compared with the first season, the injury incidence rates in lower extremity, ankle, and sprain, decreased in the intervention group by 66.0%, 79.8%, and 82.2%, respectively, in the second season, and by 82.6%, 94.6%, and 93.4%, respectively, in the third season, indicating the persistent effect of the FIFA 11+. In conclusion, the FIFA 11+ is an effective program for lower extremity injury prevention in collegiate female football players, and preventive effects persist with continuation of the program. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

While different Patient Reported Outcome Measurements (PROMs) tools exist for assessing shoulder diseases, few specific PROMs are validated for FS patients. Purpose: This study aims to assess the psychometric properties of the Disability of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire in FS patients. Methods: One hundred and twenty-four subjects (mean ± SD age = 55.4 ± 7.9 years; 55.6% female) diagnosed with FS were included and completed the DASH questionnaire, the Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), and the Short-Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36). Floor or ceiling effects were investigated. Structural validity was analysed through a unidimensional Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), internal consistency through Cronbach’s alpha, test-retest reliability through the Intraclass Correlation coefficient (ICC), measurement error through the Standard Error of Measurement (SEM), and the Minimum Detectable Change (MDC), and construct validity through the hypothesis testing with the correlation with the other outcome measures used. Results: No floor or ceiling effects were observed. CFA confirmed a one-factor structure after addressing local item dependency (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation = 0.055; Standardized Root Mean Square Residual = 0.077; Comparative Fit Index = 0.970; Tucker-Lewis Index = 0.968). Cronbach’s alpha was high (= 0.951), and test-retest reliability was excellent (ICC = 0.999; 95% CI: 0.998-1.000). SEM was equal to 0.5 points, and MDC to 1.5 points. Construct validity was considered satisfactory as 80% of the a-priori hypotheses were met. Conclusion: The DASH questionnaire demonstrated good psychometric properties in FS patients, supporting its use as a valuable tool for assessing the impact of FS in clinical and research settings. © The Author(s) 2024.",Adhesive capsulitis; Patient-reported outcome measures; Psychometrics; Rehabilitation; Reproducibility of results; Validation studies,"Arm; Bursitis; Disability Evaluation; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Psychometrics; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Shoulder; Shoulder Pain; Surveys and Questionnaires; adult; Article; autoimmune disease; chronic gastritis; confirmatory factor analysis; construct validity; content validity; diabetes mellitus; Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (score); disability; distress syndrome; epilepsy; exploratory factor analysis; female; frozen shoulder; human; hypercholesterolemia; hyperglycemia; hypertension; internal consistency; knee function; major clinical study; male; mental health; middle aged; migraine; minimum detectable change; motor performance; numeric rating scale; outcome assessment; pain intensity; psychometry; quality of life; questionnaire; reliability; reproducibility; Short Form 36; shoulder pain; Shoulder Pain and Disability Index; test retest reliability; arm; bursitis; disability assessment; psychometry; reproducibility; shoulder; shoulder pain","""Pain Management and Musculoskeletal Health in Various Populations""",Chronic Pain Management and Treatment Studies,Shoulder Surgery Outcomes and Measures

Evaluation of self-reported exercise counselling behavior of those professionals. Method: A cross-sectional survey was used to collect the opinions of 171 PHCPs working with CADCCs using a structured questionnaire. The information obtained was evaluated by performing a combined quantitative and qualitative statistical analysis. Results: PHCPs in Switzerland think that CADCC do not get enough physical activity and see the underlying reasons in lacking information/knowledge and organizational factors. We found that the level of knowledge about disability sports opportunities among PHCPs has a positive influence on their exercise counselling behaviour. Conclusions: We propose three approaches to increase the level of physical activity in CADCC: Establishing personalized exercise counseling, intensifying information about disability sports programmes towards PHCPs, and improving inclusion and integration in PE lessons or regular sports clubs. © 2023 The Author(s).

The contribution of exercise as an efﬁcacious component in decreasing anxiety, depression, and anger has been increasingly recognized. Objectives: This study aims to evaluate the effects of combined training on cortisol, anxiety, depression, and anger in overweight and obese girls with CPP. Methods: The study involved 30 girls aged 7–9 years diagnosed with CPP (undergoing triptorelin treatment) and dealing with obesity. In addition, these girls scored higher than the cut-off line for anxiety, depression, and anger. The participants were divided into two groups, with 15 individuals in each group. The exercise group engaged in 60 min of combined aerobic and resistance training three times per week for a duration of 12 weeks. On the other hand, the control group did not receive any training. Throughout the study, the serum cortisol levels were measured in both groups. Anxiety, anger, and depression questionnaires were also completed at three different stages, namely, baseline, 12 weeks, and 16 weeks (after a 4-week period of detraining). Results: In the exercise group, there was a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in cortisol serum levels and anxiety, depression, and anger scores. These changes were observed consistently during detraining (P > 0.05). However, in the control group, only the depression score significantly decreased (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Based on the results, it can be concluded that combined training is a method to improve the mental health of CPP girls.

Little is understood about the factors that impede or promote effective implementation of fall prevention practices.Purpose and Relevance:Physical therapists are commonly consulted for acute care patients at risk for falling. The purpose of this study is to understand therapist perceptions of their effectiveness in fall prevention and to explore the impact of contextual factors on practice patterns to prevent falls surrounding hospitalization.Methods:Survey questions were tailored to the constructs of hospital culture, structural characteristics, networks and communications, and implementation climate, in addition to inquiries regarding practice patterns and attitudes/beliefs.Results:Overall, 179 surveys were analyzed. Most therapists (n = 135, 75.4%) affirmed their hospital prioritizes best practices for fall prevention, although fewer agreed that therapists other than themselves provide optimal fall prevention intervention (n = 105, 58.7%). Less practice experience was associated with greater odds of affirming that contextual factors influence fall prevention practice (odds ratio 3.90, p <.001). Respondents who agreed that their hospital system prioritizes best practices for fall prevention had 14 times the odds of believing that their system prioritizes making improvements (p =.002).Conclusions/Implications:As experience influences fall prevention practice, quality assurance and improvement initiatives should be used to ensure minimum specifications of practice. © National Association for Healthcare Quality.",acute care; falls; healthcare; hospital; physical therapy; quality,Hospitalization; Hospitals; Humans; Physical Therapists; Surveys and Questionnaires; adult; article; climate; emergency care; female; hospital planning; hospitalization; human; major clinical study; male; perception; physiotherapist; physiotherapy; quality control; hospital; questionnaire,Noise,Efficacy and Effects of Exercise and Therapy on Muscle Performance and Recovery,Fall Prevention and Balance Improvement in the Elderly

One Week of Single-Leg Immobilization Lowers Muscle Connective Protein Synthesis Rates in Healthy, Young Adults. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 56, No. 4, pp. 612- 622, 2024. Purpose: Short periods of limb immobilization lower myofibrillar protein synthesis rates. Within skeletal muscle, the extracellular matrix of connective proteins is recognized as an important factor determining the capacity to transmit contractile force. Little is known regarding the impact of immobilization and subsequent recovery on muscle connective protein synthesis rates. This study examined the impact of 1 wk of leg immobilization and 2 wk of subsequent ambulant recovery on daily muscle connective protein synthesis rates. Methods: Thirty healthy, young (24 ± 5 yr) men were subjected to 7 d of one-legged knee immobilization followed by 14 d of ambulant recovery. Deuterium oxide ingestion was applied over the entire period, and muscle biopsy samples were collected before immobilization, after immobilization, and after recovery to measure muscle connective protein synthesis rates and mRNA expression of key extracellular matrix proteins (collagen I, collagen III), glycoproteins (fibronectin, tenascin-C), and proteoglycans (fibromodulin, and decorin). A two-way repeated-measures (time–leg) ANOVA was used to compare changes in muscle connective protein synthesis rates during immobilization and recovery. Results: During immobilization, muscle connective protein synthesis rates were lower in the immobilized (1.07 ± 0.30%·d−1) compared with the nonimmobilized (1.48 ± 0.44%·d−1; P < 0.01) leg. When compared with the immobilization period, connective protein synthesis rates in the immobilized leg increased during subsequent recovery (1.48 ± 0.64%·d−1; P < 0.01). After recovery, skeletal muscle collagen I, collagen III, fibronectin, fibromodulin, and decorin mRNA expression increased when compared with the postimmobilization time point (all P < 0.001). Conclusions: One week of leg immobilization lowers muscle connective protein synthesis rates. Muscle connective protein synthesis rates increase during subsequent ambulant recovery, which is accompanied by increased mRNA expression of key extracellular matrix proteins. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The aim of the study is to examine the incidence of balance impairments in young adults who have recovered from mild COVID-19. The study involved 100 subjects, divided into two groups: the study group (50 individuals) comprised subjects who had recovered from mild COVID-19, and the control group (50 individuals) consisted of healthy subjects matched for gender and age. Balance was assessed using a force platform and clinical tests such as: timed up and go test, 15-s step test, sit-to-stand test and 6-min walk test. The assessment on the platform showed greater balance impairments in the trials with eyes closed; more specifically, compared to the controls, in trials with double-leg support the subjects from the study group acquired significantly higher scores in X average (lateral coordinates) (p < 0.05), Path length, V average (average Centre of Foot Pressure Velocity) (p < 0.05) and Area circular (p < 0.01), with even more significant results in trials with single-leg support in X average (p < 0.001), Y average (anterior–posterior coordinates) (p < 0.001) and Path length (p = 0.004). Higher scores in the timed up and go test were found in the study group (p = 0.013). The control group had higher scores in the remaining tests. The current findings show that mild COVID-19 may lead to balance impairments in young adults. Statistically significant differences in balance were found between the subjects in the study group and the healthy controls. Further studies in this area should take into account more age groups, and patients recovered from severe COVID-19, and should investigate long-term consequences of COVID-19 reflected by balance problems. © 2022, The Author(s).",,COVID-19; Exercise Test; Humans; Physical Therapy Modalities; Postural Balance; Time and Motion Studies; Young Adult; body equilibrium; exercise test; human; physiotherapy; procedures; task performance; young adult,"""Impacts of COVID-19 on Physical and Mental Health, Exercise Habits, and Rehabilitation Strategies""","Impact of COVID-19 on Health, Physical Activity and Quality of Life",Post-COVID-19 Syndrome and Rehabilitation Strategies

This updated FMS™ may be used to support clinical decisions for the well-being of athletes and active adults. Purpose The purpose of this study was to determine if the updated FMS™ has acceptable interrater reliability, so that various practitioners can utilize it with their patients. Study Design Observational Laboratory Study Methods Two licensed Physical Therapists (PTs) conducted the testing for the study. No warmup was allowed for the participants. Each participant underwent one FMS™ session while being recorded on video lasting approximately 15 minutes. Participants were allowed three attempts to complete each movement pattern with the best score recorded. The participants, 45 healthy active PT students, were taken through the FMS™ by a licensed PT and videotaped. The raters were four second-year PT students that observed and scored the FMS independently after videotaping was completed. SPSS was used for the interrater reliability analysis. ICC was calculated using a 2-way mixed model looking for absolute agreement. Results The interrater reliability was highest for the rotary stability test (ICC 0.96) while the deep squat was the least reliable (ICC 0.78). The total scores showed excellent reliability among the four student raters with an ICC of 0.95. The updated FMS™ produced good to excellent interrater reliability. Conclusion The updated FMS™ has acceptable interrater reliability between minimally, but adequately trained individuals. The updated FMS™ may be reliably used to assess risk for future injury.

Methods: 290 patients with Lumbar spinal stenosis and sciatica were analyzed. Sixty patients without sciatica were collected in the control group. Patient demography including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), serum calcium, and triglyceride level was acquired. The cross-sectional area (CSA) and percentage of fat infiltration area (Intermuscular adipose tissue (IMat%) of paraspinal muscles at the L4–5 level were measured using MRI imaging. The patients were divided into five age groups: A (18–30 years old), B (31–40 years old), C (41–50 years old), D (51–60 years old), and E (> 60 years old). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and LSD was used to analyze differences among subgroups. Student's t-test was used to compare MCSA and fat CSA in the two groups. P < 0.05 was statistically significant. Results: The paraspinal muscle CSA (MCSA) was significantly smaller in women (P < 0.05). Older age was associated with less MCSA and greater fatty infiltration in erector spinae and multifidus (MF) muscle (P < 0.05). Serum calcium and BMI were positively correlated with CSA of erector spinae muscle (P < 0.05), but not with muscle fat infiltration (P > 0.05). Although there was no significant difference in MCSA between the two groups, the fat infiltration (IMat%) in the disease group was significantly higher than in the control group (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Lumbar degenerative diseases caused the degeneration of the paravertebral muscles, which mainly resulted in increased intramuscular fat infiltration, rather than changes in the overall MCSA. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Erector spinae muscles; Fat infiltration; Multifidus muscles; Muscle cross-sectional area; Paraspinal muscle,Adolescent; Adult; Calcium; Female; Humans; Lumbar Vertebrae; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Middle Aged; Muscular Atrophy; Paraspinal Muscles; Sciatica; Young Adult; calcium; triacylglycerol; calcium; adult; Article; body mass; calcium blood level; controlled study; degenerative disease; erector spinae muscle; female; groups by age; human; human tissue; intermuscular fat; intramuscular fat; lumbar spinal stenosis; lumbar spine; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multifidus muscle; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; paraspinal muscle; retrospective study; sciatica; spinal muscular atrophy; triacylglycerol blood level; adolescent; diagnostic imaging; lumbar vertebra; muscle atrophy; pathology; procedures; sciatica; young adult,"""Balance, Mobility, and Fall Risks in Aging and Musculoskeletal Conditions""",Impact and Control of Chronic Low Back Pain and Balance in Older Adults,Impact of Exercise on Health and Rehabilitation

The status of the parasympathetic ganglia after crossing the preganglionic fibers of the vagus nerve has not been enough studied. The aim of our study was to assess the effect of physical training on the morphological parameters of the parasympathetic atrial ganglia and autonomic regulation of heart rate after right- and left-sided vagotomy in rats. Morphometric characteristics of the right atrial ganglia were evaluated using an immunohistochemical method after a study that included a three-time assessment of heart rate variability. It was found that right-sided vagotomy leads to both an increase in the volume of ganglion and autonomic dysfunction. No significant change in the number of nerve cells was found in animals with false and left-sided vagotomy while maintaining preganglionic innervation after the physical training, whereas exercises led to a decrease in the volume of nerve tissue of rats with right-sided denervation. It was also found that in animals with preserved vagal innervation, the volume of atrial ganglion tissue correlates with overall heart rate variability and a normalized parasympathetic component. Therefore, a positive effect from regular physical activity on parasympathetic regulation can be expected only if preganglionic vagal influence is preserved. © 2022 by the authors.",atrial ganglionated plexus; autonomic dysfunction; heart rate variability; heart transplantation; immunohistochemical study; parasympathetic denervation; unilateral vagotomy,animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; autonomic dysfunction; controlled study; exercise; exercise tolerance; heart atrium; heart rate; heart rate variability; immunohistochemistry; innervation; morphometry; nervous tissue; nonhuman; parasympathetic ganglion; physical activity; preganglionic nerve; rat; training; vagotomy,"""Effects of Different Therapeutic Interventions on Muscular and Neural Health""",Muscle Rehabilitation and Training Effects in Injury Recovery,Impact of Exercise and Lifestyle Changes on Health Conditions

The aim of this scoping review is to determine the role of resilience in the experience of movement-evoked pain (MEP) and return to functional activity following a musculoskeletal injury. Methods: This review conformed to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews and the scoping review protocol of the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI). Five databases and one grey literature database were searched using predetermined key words and index terms to capture published and unpublished records on the topic. Two authors independently screened the title and abstract of each record, with the full-text of eligible records being reviewed. Papers were eligible for inclusion if they examined the population, concept and context of interest, were written in English and the full text was available. Data were extracted from each eligible record to guide discussion of the available literature on this topic. Results: Of 4771 records, 2695 articles underwent screening based on their title and abstract. After title and abstract screening 132 articles were eligible for full text review, with 24 articles included in the final analysis. This review identified that psychological resilience has primarily been investigated in the context of a range of age-related pathologies. The choice of functional and movement-evoked pain assessments in the included studies were often guided by the pathology of interest, with some being general or injury specific. Conclusion: This scoping review identified inconsistent conclusions regarding the role of resilience in the experience of MEP and the ability to return to function for older adults with a musculoskeletal injury. This scoping review highlights the need for longitudinal research to be conducted that allows a broader age range, including younger adults, to determine if multidimensional resilience may promote recovery form musculoskeletal injury. © 2022, The Author(s).",function; injury; movement; musculoskeletal; pain; resilience,"Aged; Humans; Musculoskeletal Diseases; Pain; Pain Measurement; Resilience, Psychological; age distribution; Article; body movement; clinical assessment; clinical outcome; disease association; functional assessment; human; movement evoked pain; musculoskeletal injury; musculoskeletal pain; pain assessment; psychological aspect; psychological resilience; systematic review; aged; musculoskeletal disease; pain; pain measurement","""Pain Management and Musculoskeletal Health in Various Populations""",Chronic Pain Management and Treatment Studies,Wearable Devices and Techniques in Gait Analysis and Mobility Rehabilitation

It presents as a subcutaneous cording that limits the upper limb range of motion (ROM) and causes pain. Its etiology is still debated, and its treatment is not well defined. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of our specific AWS rehabilitative treatment protocol. We conducted an observational retrospective study on a cohort of 92 AWS patients referred to the oncological outpatient service of a university hospital. We collected data from medical records before (T0) and after (T1) the treatment. The studied protocol was composed of 60-min sessions, carried out 3 times/week by specialized physiotherapists, until the clinical resolution of AWS. We found that a mean of 8.74 ± 2.12 rehabilitative sessions were needed, and only one patient stopped early. At T1, shoulder ROM was complete in both abduction and flexion in 98% of patients; AWS was no longer detectable in 64% of them, and pain significantly decreased compared to T0.

Chronic ankle instability develops from an acute ankle sprain may cause negative effects on quality of life, ankle functionality or on increasing risk for recurrent ankle sprains and post-traumatic osteoarthritis. To facilitate a preventative strategy of chronic ankle instability (CAI) in the basketball population, gathering epidemiological data is essential. However, the epidemiological data of CAI in basketball is limited. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the prevalence of CAI in basketball athletes and to determine whether gender, competitive level, and basketball playing position influence this prevalence. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, in total 391 Taiwanese basketball athletes from universities and sports clubs participated. Besides non-standardized questions about demographics and their history of ankle sprains, participants further filled out the standard Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool applied to determine the presence of ankle instability. Questionnaires from 255 collegiate and 133 semi-professional basketball athletes (male = 243, female = 145, 22.3 ± 3.8 years, 23.3 ± 2.2 kg/m2) were analyzed. Differences in prevalence between gender, competitive level and playing position were determined using the Chi-square test. Results: In the surveyed cohort, 26% had unilateral CAI while 50% of them had bilateral CAI. Women had a higher prevalence than men in the whole surveyed cohort (X2(1) = 0.515, p = 0.003). This gender disparity also showed from sub-analyses, that the collegiate female athletes had a higher prevalence than collegiate men athletes (X2(1) = 0.203, p = 0.001). Prevalence showed no difference between competitive levels (p > 0.05) and among playing positions (p > 0.05). Conclusions: CAI is highly prevalent in the basketball population. Gender affects the prevalence of CAI. Regardless of the competitive level and playing position the prevalence of CAI is similar. The characteristic of basketball contributes to the high prevalence. Prevention of CAI should be a focus in basketball. When applying the CAI prevention measures, gender should be taken into consideration. © 2022, The Author(s).",Ankle injury; Ankle sprain; Basketball; Functional ankle instability; Perceived ankle instability; Survey,adult; ankle injury; ankle instability; ankle sprain; Article; basketball; body mass; chi square test; cohort analysis; controlled study; cross-sectional study; demographics; female; gender inequality; health survey; human; informed consent; major clinical study; male; prevalence; questionnaire; sex difference; statistics; test retest reliability; university; young adult,"""Sports-Related Injury, Rehabilitation, and Performance Studies""",Rehabilitation and Assessment in Athletes with Chronic Ankle Instability,Effects of different training methods on athletic performance and injury prevention

The guidelines for RTL are based on empirical evidence, however, implementation differs by institution. The purpose of the policy analysis is to evaluate RTL guidelines after SRRC of student-athletes in New England secondary school public school systems. A review of the six New England states’ policies surrounding RTL was conducted. The Comprehensive Analysis of Physical Activity Framework was referenced to identify the analytic components of existing legislation and because of the relatively new implementation of RTL-specific policy, a novel policy analysis tool was utilized. States with RTL-specific language scored on average 7.9 to 11.1 points higher when compared to states without RTL-specific language. This difference was associated with disparities in access to RTL resources for residents according to their geographic location. Lobbying efforts should be targeted toward states without RTL-specific language to provide equal care and opportunities for student-athletes to receive RTL services. RTL policy provides a responsibility to assist students who have suffered from an SRRC and can serve to improve health outcomes and academic achievement. © The Author(s) 2023.",and recreation; concussion; policy; policy analysis; return to learn; sport; state legislature,Brain Concussion; Humans; Learning; New England; Schools; Sports; brain concussion; human; learning; psychology; school; sport; United States,"""Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion: Studies on Impacts, Recovery, and Influences""",Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion Studies in Young Athletes,"Concussion in Sports: Detection, Effects, and Management"

The knee valgus angle is a fundamental axis for injury prevention and is usually measured with 2D systems such as Kinovea software (Version 0.9.4.). Technological advances such as computer vision have the potential to revolutionize sports medicine. However, the validity and reliability of computer vision must be evaluated before using it in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to analyze the test-retest and inter-rater reliability and the concurrent validity of a beta version app based on computer vision for the measurement of knee valgus angle in elite handball athletes. Methods: The knee valgus angle of 42 elite handball athletes was measured. A frontal photo during a single-leg squat was taken, and two examiners measured the angle by the beta application based on computer vision at baseline and at one-week follow-up to calculate the test-retest and inter-rater reliability. A third examiner assessed the knee valgus angle using 2D Kinovea software to calculate the concurrent validity. Results: The knee valgus angle in the elite handball athletes was 158.54 ± 5.22°. The test-retest reliability for both examiners was excellent, showing an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) of 0.859–0.933. The inter-rater reliability showed a moderate ICC: 0.658 (0.354–0.819). The standard error of the measurement with the app was stated between 1.69° and 3.50°, and the minimum detectable change was stated between 4.68° and 9.70°. The concurrent validity was strong r = 0.931; p < 0.001.

The management of superficial surgical site infection is controversial. We sought to determine whether superficial infection is associated with an increased risk of deep infection requiring surgical debridement after fixation of tibial plateau and pilon fractures. Methods: This is a secondary analysis of data from the VANCO trial, which included 980 adult patients with a tibial plateau or pilon fracture at elevated risk of infection who underwent open reduction internal fixation with plates and screws with or without intrawound vancomycin powder. An association of superficial surgical site infection with deep surgical site infection requiring debridement surgery and antibiotics was explored after matching on risk factors for deep surgical site infection. Results: Of the 980 patients, we observed 30 superficial infections (3.1%) and 76 deep infections (7.8%). Among patients who developed a superficial infection, the unadjusted incidence of developing a deep infection within 90 days was 12.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3–24.2%). However, after a 3:1 match on infection risk factors, the 90-day marginal probability of a deep surgical site infection after sustaining a superficial infection was 6.0% (95% CI − 6.5–18.5%, p = 0.35). Conclusion: Deep infection after superficial infection is uncommon following operative fixation of tibial plateau and pilon fractures. Increased risk of subsequent deep infection attributable to superficial infection was inconclusive in these data.

This presents a unique model to study the effects of sport-specific loading on interlimb differences in mechanical muscle function. This study, therefore, examined baseline interlimb asymmetries in multi-directional jump tests in elite speed skaters using a cross-sectional design. Thereafter, participants were monitored longitudinally using the bilateral countermovement jump (CMJ) to quantify interlimb differences in mechanical muscle function throughout a competitive season. Pre-season baseline testing included a single leg lateral jump (JumpLat) and a single leg forward horizontal jump (JumpHorz) attached to a robotic linear position encoder, along with a bilateral CMJ on a dual force plate system. From baseline, CMJ monitoring was conducted throughout the 24-week competitive season. Within-limb changes in right vs left CMJ concentric impulse (CMJCon) and eccentric deceleration impulse (CMJEcc) were assessed using a linear mixed effects model. No systematic interlimb differences were found at baseline (p = 0.33–0.98) and the between-test agreement in limb dominance was poor (Kappa = −0.17–0.33). Furthermore, there were no time effects observed for interlimb differences in CMJCon (fixed effect = 0.01 N*s) and a small decrease in CMJEcc (fixed effects = −0.35 N*s, p = 0.01). These data suggest that even in a sport with asymmetrical loading, interlimb differences in mechanical output remain stable at the group level. However, changes occurring at the individual athlete level may be occurring that are meaningful for performance and injury. © 2023 by the authors.",horizontal jump; limb dominance; maximal power test; monitoring; ratio; unilateral jump; vertical jump,,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Effects of different training methods on athletic performance and injury prevention

The UK-based PANDA-S programme (Prognostic And Diagnostic Assessment of the Shoulder) is investigating short and long-term shoulder pain outcomes. This paper reports linked qualitative research exploring patients’ and clinicians’ views towards primary care consultations for shoulder pain. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 patients and 15 primary care clinicians. Twenty-two interviews (11 patients, 11 clinicians) were conducted as matched patient-clinician ‘dyads’. Data were analysed thematically. Results: Clinicians reported attempts to involve patients in management decisions; however, there was variation in whether patients preferred treatment choice, or for decisions to be clinician-led. Some patients felt uncertain about the decisions made, due to a lack of discussion about available management options. Many General Practitioners expressed a lack of confidence in diagnosing the underlying cause of shoulder pain. Patients reported either not being given a diagnosis, or receiving different diagnoses from different professionals, resulting in confusion. Whilst clinicians reported routinely discussing prognosis of shoulder pain, patients reported that prognosis was not raised. Patients also expressed concern that their shoulder pain could be caused by serious pathology; however, clinicians felt that this was not a common concern for patients. Conclusions: Findings showed disparities between patients’ and clinicians’ views towards shoulder pain consultations, indicating a need for improved patient-clinician communication. Findings will inform the design of an intervention to support treatment and referral decisions for shoulder pain that will be tested in a randomised controlled trial. © 2023, The Author(s).",Diagnosis; General practice; Primary care; Prognosis; Qualitative; Shoulder pain,Humans; Musculoskeletal Pain; Primary Health Care; Prognosis; Qualitative Research; Referral and Consultation; Shoulder; Shoulder Pain; adult; aged; Article; clinical article; clinician; cohort analysis; consultation; data analysis; decision making; female; health program; human; longitudinal study; male; primary medical care; qualitative analysis; self care; semi structured interview; shoulder pain; thematic analysis; uncertainty; musculoskeletal pain; patient referral; primary health care; prognosis; qualitative research; shoulder; shoulder pain,"""Shoulder Joint Health and Rehabilitation: Arthroscopic Surgeries, Treatments and Outcomes""",Clinical Outcomes and Treatments in Shoulder Care,Shoulder Surgery Outcomes and Measures

Moreover, its incidence can be reduced through eliminating preventable causes. The present study aimed to assess the descriptive characteristics of spinal traumas and the conditions associated with mortality in our country. Materials and methods: Our study was conducted retrospectively in the emergency service of a tertiary care hospital. Data of patients visiting to our hospital’s emergency room between 2020 and 2023 with spinal trauma, were obtained from the hospital information management system by scanning electronic patient records for inclusion in the study. Results: A total of 1835 patients were included in our study, of which 427 (23.3%) were female and 1408 (76.7%) were male. The most common complaint of the included patients who presented to the emergency room was observed as falls (n=1112). 52.8% (n=968) of those patients with special traumas had other concomitant injury. 3.7% (n=68) of the included patients resulted in death. Conclusion: Falls are the most common cause of special traumas in our country and concomitant head trauma and thoracic trauma are closely associated with mortality. While men are more frequently presented to the emergency room with special trauma, there has been no difference between both sexes in terms of mortality rate. Moreover, the most common vertebral fractures after spinal trauma occur in the parts of the corpus and spinous processes of the lumbar vertebrae. © 2024, Pamukkale University.

Treatment mechanisms can be specific to the intervention provided (i.e. pain modulation) or shared with other treatments (i.e. reduced fear of movement). Whether specific and shared treatment mechanisms are different across interventions and whether they lead to the outcomes seen in trials is largely unknown. The management of individuals with chronic neck pain routinely include manual therapy (MT) and resistance exercise (RE), as both approaches are included in clinical practice guidelines and both yield similar outcomes. Objectives: Our study plans to answer two research questions: 1) what are the specific mechanisms associated with MT versus interventions (and are these different), and 2) what are the shared mechanisms associated with these interventions, and do specific or shared mechanisms mediate clinical outcomes? Methods: This study will involve a 2-group parallel (1:1) single-blinded randomized trial to compare the specific and potential shared treatment mechanisms between these two approaches. We will enroll individuals with a history of chronic neck pain and evaluate whether specific or shared mechanisms mediate clinical outcomes. Results: We hypothesize that MT and RE approaches will both exhibit different specific treatment mechanisms, and that both approaches will exhibit shared treatment mechanisms, which will notably influence outcomes at both discharge and 6-months. Conclusions: This study is important because it will help identify what specific or shared treatment mechanisms are associated with different interventions and, how different treatment mechanisms influence clinical outcomes. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Manual therapy; Mechanisms; Neck pain; Physical therapy,Chronic Pain; Exercise; Exercise Therapy; Humans; Musculoskeletal Manipulations; Neck Pain; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; accuracy; adult; Article; chronic neck pain; clinical outcome; clinical practice; clinician; controlled study; follow up; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human experiment; manipulative medicine; neck pain; pain; physiotherapist; practice guideline; pressure pain threshold; provocation; randomized controlled trial; range of motion; resistance training; sample size; screening; single blind procedure; training; chronic pain; exercise; kinesiotherapy; musculoskeletal manipulation; neck pain; procedures; randomized controlled trial (topic),"""Pain Management and Musculoskeletal Health in Various Populations""",Chronic Pain Management and Treatment Studies,Management and Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

Problem Statement: Concussion assessments exist with efforts to limit headers. Heading drills performed in different environments have conflicting results regarding influences on assessments. Approach: To evaluate, within an ecological real-setting environment with unpredictable conditions reflective of game situations, a heading drill’s effect on the King-Devick (K-D) and Biodex Biosway Balance Assessment (CTSIB-M). Preseason and post-heading metrics were taken for eleven female high school varsity soccer players (16 ± 1.4 years old) using K-D and CTSIB-M. K-D and CTSIB-M tests were repeated following a heading drill (HD). The number of headers and acceleration data during HD was recorded by Triax Smart Impact Monitor-G (SIM-G). Results: Each participant had an average of six headers (± 2.9 SD) with acceleration (minimum to maximum 27.5 ± 3.4 g to 57.4 ± 9.9 g) recorded by Triax SIM-G. K-D score time (42.9 ± 6.8 se conds compared to 41.6 ± 4.9 seconds, p = 0.37) and CTSIB-M sway index (0.79 ± 0.13 compared to 0.83 ± 0.13 cm, p = 0.17) pre-and post-test scores lacked statistical significance. Conclusion: It failed to show a correlation with head acceleration data (e.g., linear and rotational accelerations). A single soccer heading drill may not affect performance on the K-D and CTSIB-M. Regularly monitoring different metrics (e.g., K-D or CTSIB-M) for teams who practice more aggressive heading drills may inform training such skills while identifying potentially detrimental effects from repetitive soccer heading impacts during a competitive season. © JPES.",adolescent sports; head injury; postural control; repetitive head impacts; saccades,,"""Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion: Studies on Impacts, Recovery, and Influences""",Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion Studies in Young Athletes,"Concussion in Sports: Detection, Effects, and Management"

Arthroscopic repair has emerged as the main surgical treatment modality for posterior instability. However, when compared with arthroscopic repair for anterior instability, the results of this procedure remain suboptimal. The creation of iatrogenic defects in the capsule, due to cannula placement, is a possible culprit. Because these defects typically do not heal satisfactorily, they become stress risers within the capsule itself, which may lead to recurrent instability or an otherwise compromised repair construct. Therefore, we find that routine intraoperative repair of these defects after repair can reduce the risk of injury and possibly improve long-term outcomes. In this article, we illustrate the repair of a posterior segmental tear using all-suture knotless implants with closure of the posterior and posterior-inferior portals after stabilization. © 2023 The Authors",,nitinol; Article; human; patient assessment; peroperative care; recurrent shoulder dislocation; shoulder arthroscopy; shoulder surgery; surgical technique; treatment indication,"""Shoulder Joint Health and Rehabilitation: Arthroscopic Surgeries, Treatments and Outcomes""",Clinical Outcomes and Treatments in Shoulder Care,Shoulder Pathologies and Treatment Techniques

The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the effects of resistance exercise training on cognitive performance and depressive symptoms among community-dwelling older Chinese Americans. The study was a two-arm randomized controlled trial with pre-test/post-test design. Thirty older adults were randomly assigned into the resistance exercise intervention group or the wait-list control group. Participants’ cognitive performance and depressive symptoms were evaluated at baseline (pre-test) and at 12 weeks (post-test). The results showed that there were significant differences between the intervention and control groups on changes in symptoms of depression, global cognitive function, visuospatial/executive functions, attention, language, and orientation. However, there were no significant differences between both groups on changes in naming, abstraction, and delayed recall domains. The findings of this study suggest that resistance exercise training has a positive impact on improving cognitive performance and depressive symptoms in older adults. © 2023 by the authors.",cognition; cognitive function; depression; executive function; memory; older adults; physical activity; randomized controlled trial; resistance exercise; strength exercise,,"""Cognitive Decline Prevention and Improvement through Exercise and Therapeutic Interventions""",Exercise Interventions and Cognitive Function in Older Adults,Exercise and Cognitive Function in Aging Adults

In this sense, considering the multi-factorial etiology of COVID-19, multi-professional interventions could be a relevant strategy for recovery health indicators. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effects of multi-professional intervention on body composition, physical fitness, and biomarkers in overweight COVID-19 survivors with different symptomatology. Methodology: A non-randomized parallel group intervention included 69 volunteers (BMI ≥25 kg/m2), divided into three groups according to SARS CoV-2 symptomatology, but only 35 finished the longitudinal protocol [control group (n = 11); moderate group (n = 17) and severe group (n = 7)]. The groups were submitted to a multi-professional program (nutritional intervention, psychoeducation, and physical exercise intervention) for 8 weeks, and the volunteers underwent body composition assessments (primary outcome) and physical and biochemical tests (secondary outcome) in pre- and post-intervention. This study was registered on the Clinical Trials Registration Platform number: RBR-4mxg57b and with the local research ethics committee protocol under number: 4,546,726/2021. Results: After the 8-week multi-professional intervention, the following results were observed for the moderate COVID-19 group: improved dynamic strength of lower- and (p = 0.003), upper-limbs (p = 0.008), maximal isometric lumbar-traction strength (p = 0.04), flexibility (p = 0.0006), and albumin (p = 0.0005), as well as a reduction in the C reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.003) and fasting glucose (p = 0.001); for the severe COVID-19 group: an improvement in dynamic lower-body strength (p = 0.001), higher values of albumin (p = 0.005) and HDL-c (p = 0.002), and lower values of CRP (p = 0.05), and for the control group: an improvement in sit-up repetitions (p = 0.008), and a reduction of CRP (p = 0.01), fasting glucose (p = 0.001) and total cholesterol (p = 0.04) were identified. All experimental groups reduced triglycerides after intervention (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Finally, 8 weeks of multiprofessional intervention can be an efficient tool for reversing the inflammatory process and promoting improvements in daily activities and quality of life, although it is believed that the severe COVID-19 group needs longer interventions to improve different health indicators.

However, the long-term implications of poor sleep at baseline have been less well studied. Objective: To examine the implications of insufficient sleep at baseline, as well as factors such as symptom reporting and neurocognitive performance at baseline associated with insufficient sleep, for the risk of sport-related concussion (SRC). Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Undergraduate institution. Patients or Other Participants: Student-athletes (N = 614) were divided into 2 groups based on the hours slept the night before baseline testing: sufficient (.7.07 hours) or insufficient (≤5.78 hours) sleepers. Athletes who went on to sustain an SRC during their athletic careers at our university were identified. Main Outcome Measure(s): Four symptom clusters (cognitive, physical, affective, and sleep) and headache were examined as self-reported outcomes. Four neurocognitive outcome measures were explored: mean composite of memory, mean composite of attention/processing speed, memory intraindividual variability (IIV), and attention/processing speed IIV. Results: Insufficient sleepers at baseline were nearly twice as likely (15.69%) as sufficient sleepers (8.79%) to go on to sustain an SRC. Insufficient sleepers at baseline, whether or not they went on to sustain an SRC, reported a higher number of baseline symptoms than did sufficient sleepers. When compared with either insufficient sleepers at baseline who did not go on to incur an SRC or with sufficient sleepers who did go on to sustain an SRC, the insufficient sleep group that went on to incur an SRC performed worse at baseline on mean attention/processing speed. Conclusions: The combination of insufficient sleep and worse attention/processing speed performance at baseline may increase the risk of sustaining a future SRC. © by the National Athletic Trainers’ Association, Inc.",cognitive functioning; concussion; postconcussion symptoms; self-report; sports injuries,Athletes; Athletic Injuries; Brain Concussion; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Neuropsychological Tests; Prospective Studies; Sleep; Sleep Deprivation; athlete; brain concussion; complication; cross-sectional study; human; neuropsychological assessment; prospective study; sleep; sleep deprivation; sport injury,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,"Concussion in Sports: Detection, Effects, and Management"

Materials and methods: Patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) (n = 164) and healthy individuals (n = 25) performed strenuous exercise on a bicycle ergometer. Blood was drawn at baseline, immediately after exercise and 2 h later. Platelet aggregation was measured with Multiplate® Analyzer. Thrombin generation was determined using a thrombogram and by measuring prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F1 + 2). A clot lysis assay was used to investigate fibrinolysis. Results: From baseline to immediately after exercise, thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP)-induced platelet aggregation increased in CAD patients (Δ77 AU × min, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 46;107) and in healthy individuals (Δ153 AU × min, 95%CI: 75;232). Endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) was unaffected by exercise, whilst F1 + 2 increased (Δ17%, 95%CI: 11;24) in CAD patients. Fibrin clot lysis time increased by 9 % (95%CI: 1–17) in CAD patients and by 26 % (95%CI: 8;45) in healthy individuals. When comparing baseline to 2 h post-exercise, TRAP-induced platelet aggregation remained slightly elevated in both CAD patients (Δ53 AU × min, 95%CI: 22;84) and healthy individuals (Δ140 AU × min, 95%CI: 62;219). In contrast, ETP and F1 + 2 decreased in CAD patients (Δ-6 %, 95%CI: −10;-1 and Δ-8 %, 95%CI: -14;-2). Moreover, clot lysis time decreased (Δ-19 %, 95%CI: −27;-11) in patients with CAD and returned to baseline in healthy individuals. All p-values were <0.05. Conclusions: Platelet aggregation and F1 + 2 were substantially elevated immediately after exercise in CAD patients, indicating a pro-thrombotic state. After 2 h of recovery, they exhibited a markedly increase in fibrinolysis.

As these tests are not always available in cardiac rehabilitation due to logistic/cost constraints, we aimed to develop a predictive model to estimate MWR at CPX (estMWR@CPX) in CHF patients using anthropometric and clinical measures and the 6-min walk test (6 MWT), the most widely used exercise field test. Methods: This is a multicentre cross-sectional retrospective study in a cardiac rehabilitation setting. Six hundred patients with HF in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I-III underwent both CPX and 6 MWT and, through multivariable linear regression analysis, we defined several predictive models to define estMWR@CPX. Results: The best model included 6 MWT, sex, age, weight, NYHA class, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), smoking status and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD (adjusted R2 = 0.55; 95% LoA −39 to 33 W). When LVEF was excluded as a predictor, the resulting model performed only slightly worse (adjusted R2 = 0.54; 95% LoA −42 to 34 W). Only in 34% of cases was the percentage difference between estMWR@CPX and real MWR@CPX <10% in absolute value. EstMWR@CPX tended to overestimate low values and underestimate high values of true MWR@CPX. Conclusions: Our results showed a lack of accuracy in the predictive model evaluated; therefore, for an accurate prescription of cycle-ergometer exercise training, it is necessary to assess MWR by CPX or SLIT. © 2024 The Authors",6-Min walking test; Cardiopulmonary exercise testing; Chronic heart failure,beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; diuretic agent; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; adult; age; aged; Article; body weight; cardiopulmonary exercise test; cardiovascular parameters; chronic obstructive lung disease; controlled study; cross-sectional study; exercise; exercise intensity; female; heart failure; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart rehabilitation; human; linear regression analysis; major clinical study; male; maximal work rate; multicenter study (topic); New York Heart Association class; outcome assessment; people by smoking status; predictive model; predictive value; predictor variable; prescription; retrospective study; sex; six minute walk test; very elderly,"""Physical Activity and Health Outcomes in Aging Populations""",Physical Activity and Health in Older Adults,Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation and Exercise Training

Despite the clinical importance of the multimodal intervention approach, only one study using a multimodal approach demonstrated promising improvements in memory, attention, and executive functions, which also correlated with functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) changes in cerebral activation in 50 MCI patients. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the self-perception and anticipated efficacy of each element of the BRAIN-FIT multimodal intervention program (robotic-assisted gait training (RAGT), computerized cognitive therapy, music, light, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and diaphragmatic breathing exercises) and the correlation between memory, concentration, depression, and sleep in older adults with MCI. METHODS: One hundred participants (mean±standard deviation: 8.63±78.4 years; 47 women) with MCI were recruited from a major university medical center and community dementia relief center. The survey questionnaire comprised four domains with 21 questions, including four pertaining to general demographic characteristics, eight related to exercise and activity, three related to sleep, and nine related to the BRAIN-FIT program. Chi-squared test was used to analyze the Likert scale data. The descriptive frequencies were calculated. Additionally, Spearman's rho statistics measure the rank-order association. The statistical significance was at P < 0.05. RESULTS: A strong correlation was observed between memory and concentration (r = 0.850, P = 0.000), memory and depression (r = 0.540, P = 0.000), memory and sleep (r = 0.502, P = 0.000), concentration and depression (r = 0.602, P = 0.000), concentration and sleep (r = 0.529, P = 0.000) and sleep and depression (r = 0.497, P = 0.000). The correlation between medical services and sleep (r = 0.249, P = 0.012) was moderate. The chi-square test revealed a significant difference in memory and low-intensity duration of exercise (χ2[3,N = 100] = 11.69, P = 0.01), concentration and high-intensity exercise duration (χ2[3,N = 100] = 10.08, P = 0.02), concentration with low-intensity exercise duration (χ2[3,N = 100] = 21.11, P = 0.00), depression with high-intensity (χ2[3,N = 100] = 10.36, P = 0.02), high-intensity duration of exercise (χ2[3,N = 100] = 10.48, P = 0.02); low-intensity (χ2[3,N = 100] = 7.90, P = 0.48), and low-intensity duration of exercise (χ2[3,N = 100] = 9.69, P = 0.02). Additionally, significant differences were observed between sleep and high-intensity (χ2[3, N = 100] = 10.36, P = 0.02), low-intensity (χ2[3, N = 100] = 18.14, P = 0.00), and low-intensity duration of exercise (χ2[3, N = 100] = 18.30, P = 0.00). Among the participants 5% answered RAGT, and 20% responded that they had experienced computerized cognitive therapy. Music therapy (20 %), diaphragmatic breathing exercises (45 %), and light therapy (10 %) were used. No patient had experienced tDCS. Conversely, 11% of the participants answered RAGT for programs they wanted to experience and 21% responded to computerized cognitive therapy. 25% of music therapy, 22% of diaphragmatic breathing exercises, 5% of light therapy, and 16% of tDCS participants said they wanted to experience it. Finally, 63% of the participants wanted to participate in the BRAIN-FIT program. CONCLUSION: The present study's results provide clinical evidence-based insights into the utilization of BRAIN-FIT in MCI to maximize cognitive score improvement of memory, concentration, depression, and sleep.

However, the best total ground contact frequency (TGCF) and overall intervention time (OIT) for these exercises remain unclear. This meta-analysis aims to identify optimal TGCF and OIT in plyometric training for adolescents, focusing on countermovement jump (CMJ) and squat jump (SJ) outcomes. This systematic review encompassed five databases and included 38 studies with 50 randomized controlled experiments and 3347 participants. We used the Cochrane risk assessment tool for study quality and Review Manager 5.4 for data analysis. The current meta-analysis incorporated a total of 38 studies, comprising 50 sets of randomized controlled trials, to investigate the influence of different TGCFs and OITs on plyometric training. The Cochrane risk assessment tool indicated that all the included studies were classified as low risk. Various TGCFs in plyometric training positively affected CMJ and SJ heights in adolescents. The TGCF of less than 900 was ideal for enhancing CMJ, whereas more than 1400 was effective for SJ. The optimal OIT was 400–600 min, specifically, 500–600 min for CMJ and 400–500 min for SJ. Plyometric training improves jumping ability in adolescents. Lower ground contact frequency (< 900 contacts) enhances CMJ, while higher ground contact frequency (> 1400 contacts) is more effective for SJ. Optimal intervention time ranges from 400 to 600 min, with 500 to 600 min benefiting CMJ and 400 to 500 min improving SJ. © 2023, The Author(s).",,Adolescent; Athletic Performance; Exercise; Humans; Muscle Strength; Plyometric Exercise; Posture; adolescent; article; exercise; human; jumping; meta analysis; plyometrics; randomized controlled trial; risk assessment; systematic review; training; athletic performance; body position; muscle strength,"Physical Fitness, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention Studies",Athletic Performance and Injury Prevention in Young Players,Effects of different training methods on athletic performance and injury prevention

Twenty-eight young male volleyball players (between 14 and 18 years old) participated in this study. Athletes were submitted to: isokinetic muscle strength assessment of shoulder rotator muscles, ball service speed assessment, anterior and posterior drawer test, apprehension test, groove sign and scapular dyskinesia test. Athletes were followed for 16 weeks to monitor the presence of shoulder pain. All athletes were submitted to the same training protocol. During the 16 weeks, 28.5% of the athletes (n=8) experienced shoulder pain in the dominant limb higher than 3 according to Numerical Rating Scale criteria; 71.5% of the athletes (n=20) did not experience pain, or pain equal or lower than 3. The main result of our study was that the odds of feeling pain higher than 3 was significantly higher among players who presented higher values for internal rotation peak torque (OR=1.113, CI 95%=1.006 to 1.232 and p=0.038). The odds of feeling pain increased by 11% for every N·m of the internal rotator muscles. Pre-season isokinetic rotator strength assessments can help identify adolescent volleyball players at increased risk of a shoulder injury. © 2023 Georg Thieme Verlag.
